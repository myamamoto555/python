charles bennett ibm fellow ibm research 
bennett recent work ibm concentrate physical basis information apply quantum physics problem surround information exchange 
play major role elucidate interconnection physics information particularly realm quantum computation also cellular automaton reversible computing 
discover gilles brassard concept quantum cryptography one founding father modern quantum information theory 
bear 1943 new york city earn chemistry brandeis university 1964 receive phd harvard 1970 molecular dynamics study computer simulation molecular motion david turnbull berni alder 
next two year continue research late rahman argonne laboratory 
join ibm research 1972 build work ibm rolf landauer show computation perform logically thermodynamically reversible apparatus 1982 propose maxwell demon attribute inability break second law thermodynamic cost destroy rather acquire information 
also publish important paper estimation free energy difference two system bennett acceptance ratio method 
collaboration gilles brassard \ de \ develop practical system quantum cryptography know allow secure communication party share secret information initially base uncertainty principle 
help john smolin build world first work demonstration quantum cryptography 1989 
research interest include algorithmic information theory concept information randomness develop term relation universal computer analogous use universal computer define intrinsic complexity \ logical depth \ physical state time require universal computer simulate evolution state random initial state 
1993 bennett brassard collaboration discover \ quantum teleportation \ effect complete information unknown quantum state decompose purely classical information purely correlation send two separate channel later reassemble new location produce exact replica original quantum state destroy send process 
work smolin ibm divincenzo collaborator introduce several technique faithful transmission classical quantum information noisy channel part larger recently active field quantum information computation theory
