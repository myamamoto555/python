jacob professor chemical engineering material university california santa barbara ucsb 
receive physics university cambridge 1972 join ucsb 1986 
research involve study molecular interfacial force 
work applicable wide range industrial fundamental science problem 
particular contribute significantly understanding colloidal dispersion biological system polymer engineering application 
currently study interfacial phenomenon physics thin film fundamental question rheology tribology surface 
develop numerous technique static dynamic measurement material molecular property vapor liquid surface 
particular pioneer sensitive interfacial technique know surface force apparatus sfa 
instrument involve carefully approach two surface usually immerse solvent water measure force attraction repulsion 
use piezoelectric positional movement optical interferometry position sense instrument resolve distance within nanometer force 10 n level 
technique similar measure force interaction atomic force microscope afm sample surface except specialize sfa measure much force intend interaction measurement oppose measurement 
result sfa experiment use characterize nature intermolecular potential molecular property 
also author textbook \ intermolecular surface force \ publish academic press 
authoritative book describe fundamental concept equation applicable intermolecular interfacial science discipline
