john torrence tate jr. bear march 13 , 1925 , minneapolis , minnesota american mathematician , distinguish many fundamental contribution algebraic number theory related area algebraic geometry . 
write ph.d. princeton 1950 student emil artin , harvard university 1954 \ , university texas austin . 
tate 's thesis , analytic property class l-function introduce erich hecke , one relatively dissertation become byword . 
method , novel time , fourier analysis group adele , work recover hecke 's result . 
subsequently tate work emil artin give treatment class field theory base cohomology group , explain content galois cohomology class , introduce tate cohomology group . 
follow decade tate extend reach galois cohomology : poitou \ duality , abelian variety , tate \ group , relation algebraic k-theory . 
make number individual important contribution p-adic theory : lubin \ local theory complex multiplication formal group ; rigid analytic space ; ` tate curve ' certain p-adic elliptic curve ; tate \ group . 
many result immediately publish write jean-pierre serre . 
collaborate major publish paper good reduction abelian variety . 
tate conjecture equivalent \ cohomology hodge conjecture . 
relate galois action cohomology algebraic variety , identify space ` tate cycle ' fix cycle suitably action pick algebraic cycle . 
special case conjecture , open general case , involve proof mordell conjecture gerd . 
tate profound influence development number theory role phd advisor . 
student include joe buhler , benedict gross , robert , james milne , carl pomerance , ken ribet , joseph h. silverman , dinesh thakur , jeremy teitelbaum . 
award wolf prize mathematics .
