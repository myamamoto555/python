look c source code test 3d point lie within 
concave . 
read article know 
two solution exist : parity counting angle . 

idea pretty simple code . 
wonder exist 
public domain source code . 
another ` rough ' care special case 
report less independent number face 
consist polyhedron special space indexing use 
m. tamminen , et . 
al. , 1984 . 
`` block model conversion 
use spatial index '' . 
. 
4 , 1984 , 60-65 . 
facet polyhedron 
normal point outside polyhedron . 
could practice ? 
set consist polyhedron . 
could ensure 
normal point outside polyhedron ? 
paper mention assume 
already case . 
also read standard computer graphic textbook hide 
line removal . 
say `` make rule normal facet point 
toward viewer standing far away polyhedron ... '' .
