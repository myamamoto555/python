yes , one thing think pricing 160m harddrive 
configuration . 
get lowly classic ii , option 40 80m 
harddrive , clear buy another 40m harddrive space 
would cost much difference price two config - 
. 
analogous break 160 price , 
regret spend extra money larger harddrive . 
particularly ever wind want use , set 
30 ! 
partition , generate large file 
dtp software , might ever want check mac unix-like 
os , like , extra space helpful . 

pricing use 's , look harddrive size come , much 
would cost add storage road ... might 
useful bargaining strategy even see reason go 80m , though 
must admit packrat within 6 month get 
computer , back lot stuff floppy rarely use 
run space , without start use dtp stuff , 
try unix os !
