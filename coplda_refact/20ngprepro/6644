, completely misunderstand . 
oppose intervention 
somalia reason oppose intervention bosnia - 
security interest united states justify risk 
life american serviceman , many crisis world 
take . 
case bosnia , risk obviously much 
greater , country much better position far 
better reason take action us .

similarly ,

> theory predict . 
continue misunderstand . 
say reason people want 
intervene racist < - seem overly fond use 
word , btw . 
say phenomenon race-related , 
racist . 
perhaps distinction subtle grasp motive - 
say attention outrage entire yugoslavian situation result 
1 closer home , 2 happen people identify , 
3 relentlessly harp media . 
never say anything side 
would prefer , lot presentation 
conflict psychological factor . 
think doubt despite 
fact intervene somalia , level attention devote 
considerably less devote bosnia , newspaper tv news 
see guide .
