service indicator work way : 
5 green ,1 yellow , 1 red indicator . 
initially green indicator minute start 
car . 
computer actually `` sense '' drive car 
time go green indicator start go one one 
yellow indicator turn red indicator go 
. 
get service time green indicator . 
service mechanic reset service indicator 
computer start count . 
expect tool procedure reset green light 
come yellow red light go . 
wonder people oil change themself without know reset 
indicator .

vehicle determine often change oil .
