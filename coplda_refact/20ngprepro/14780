minor point , let make anyway ; de young 
already contradict prior assertion abstract 
ancient analysis issue concern action 
orientation . 
doubt much bearing 
article , think point start . 
hypothesis de young advance paul coin word 
b intended meaning reference levitical law . 

question wish raise 
1 . 
would one go confirm truth hypothesis ? 
2 . 
follow one accept stipulate , sake 
discussion correct ? 
note b independent ; consider b far plausible , 
seem merely counsel despair finding nothing 
literature contemporary paul clarify word . 
far know , 
paul general invent word anywhere else letter . 
unless 
pattern coinage , sound 
methodology assume -- particularly give hint - 
eat text `` fix '' coinage 's meaning audience . 
yet , extract present evidence . 
need confirm 
reject hypothesis ? 
, say outset , find somewhat 
plausible ; certainly know nothing make impossible way 
construe problem passage . 
go set aside moment 
question whether paul might coin usage , look 
tractable question mean . 
, principle , 
two kind evidence adduce , internal external . 
, 
look text paul 's letter clarification look outside 
prior contemporary writings paul might rely , 
derivative writings claim access paul 's meaning . 
single worst problem word corinthians 
internal evidence paul 's meaning . 
use word totally without 
explanation hint meaning , save inclusion list 
negative imply negative meaning . 
leave , `` internal '' clue , etymology formation 
word -- indeed reason de young 
associate leviticus prohibition man verb 
man , verb standard euphemism sex `` lie '' 
leviticus , `` bed '' greek . 
one problem `` '' _ - _ 
, far know , use way greek . 
therefore , offer one 
serious test de young 's hypothesis must pass reject : 
o find body greek text contemporary paul much 
prior day _ _ formation imply 
`` man sex x '' obviously , `` best case '' 
find usage _ _ . 
text would confirmation word read way . 
worth emphasize compound word general - 
project reader may imagine juxtaposition 
root . 
existence parallel prove hypothesis 
correct -- go long way towards make usage whether 
original paul specific case x _ arse : n _ possible 
comprehension reader . 
`` test '' move direction external evidence . 
paul 
text explain word , expect 
reader already know word stand coinage 
expect mimic word formation know , 
guess meaning without much flounder . 
external evidence , , text paul 's lexicographic 
consideration might adduce , come 
picture . 
use word , dependent paul , 
sufficient internal contextual evidence -- gloss 
contemporary scribe -- show derogatory reference male - 
, similar _ - _ formation use similar way , one 
grounds 
o deny paul coin word 
o assume reader might understand meaning 
see problem ? 
paul coin word , require 
reader share enough context comprehend coinage 
intent -- case would stipulate de young 's guess 
understand refer levitical `` universal '' prohibition 
male-male sex , mind , context paul emphasize 
least congregation one assume corinthians -- 
else explain 1 cor . 
6:12 , corinthians pull 
back freedom ? 
non applicability torah 
law gentile convert ! 
among consideration make implausible paul coin 
word , first element archaic -- _ arse : n _ old attic 
ionic form even classical let alone koine time would 
assimilate _ arre : n _ . 
, imply even 
usually needful external evidence pin meaning usage . 

paul invent word obsolete attic formation ? 
coin word , pick like 
list common term derogation , meaning -- 
reader -- constrain common meaning since give 
. 
emphasize enough paul tell us mean 
word . 
original reader guess . 
, least , 
contemporary context -- maybe paul use word 
explain great detail person . 
trace 
evidence , suppose mere fantasy . 
-- desperately need external evidence word . 
seem exceptionally meager . 
precisely problem . 
think several less equally plausible hypothesis 
word : 
standard gutter term abuse , maybe 
specific , maybe general homosexual male activity 
b term abuse use jews awful homosexual 
greek may may consciously associate 
part leviticus passage 
c paul invent term -- may may 
association leviticus . 
may may 
intend word explicit universal application 
absolute clear boundary . 
since none 
word list character , last seem 
least plausible hypothesis advance . 
, would say top head plausible -- 
still reservation , . 
word never appear paul , later use evidence 
depend paul , one opt paul 's coin . 

appear , might still coin unaware prior 
use case , coinage inherently confusing ! 
one 
normally demote c basis earlier use especially 
show common place paul travel . 

either b case , one take account paul 's relation 
community usage pick word -- whether 
greek jewish community , paul 's relation hardly straight - 
forward ! 
, far yet see , little external evidence aid 
select one hypothesis . 
guess 
good mine maybe worse maybe better , depend lot thing . 
remain -- far -- guesswork . 
know , 
one equate human guesswork god . 
means 
convince conscience paul get -- 
say elsewhere day major controversy somewhat 
character romans 14:22 -23 
`` hold belief , god -- 
consider man fortunate make decision without go 
conscience . 
anybody eat state doubt 
condemn , good faith , every act 
bad faith sin . '' 
part , see way resolve paul 's meaning use 
_ _ without directly applicable external evidence -- 
nature external evidence , never reach certainty 
constrain paul 's intent . 
paul , like humpty dumpty , 
rest use word way personal choice -- 
sometimes leave reader puzzle . 
puzzlement lead 
god , may bless -- lead away paul 's 
word lead people , paul 's intense communicative effort 
contrive meaning soul may consequence . 
always find paul fantastically reliable guide -- 
read `` large '' , see lay position detail 
hammer home time time . 
much less certain 
mean many brief cryptic passage one . 
usual discursive way , go great length first 
intended point -- would need confirm 
paul coin b case mean word mean 
leviticus prohibition . 
second point stipulate hypo -
