simple . 
take physics book , start look statement 
say objective physics . 
doubt find . 
might 
find statement objective length , objective location , 
objective _ physics _ ? 
consider , instance , - 
vacuum invariant . 
sound awful lot like objective

however , physics objective . 
bohr say randomness

talk exact result . 
neither claim experimental evidence prove 
right . 
similar vein , yet experimental evidence 
supersymmetric particle ; physicist believe , 
-- agree either objectively true 
answer question .
