know kinda subject , really , want 
answer , well everyone else 's information . 

people propose , large already exist purchase today . 
call labview national instruments . 
wonderful object 
orient graphical programming language . 
implement 
mac 's pc 's vme unix box . 
fare superior programming 
approach ever see allow decrease software 
development time shuttle payload 90 percent . 
program 
specific hardware already analysis 
capability . 
re-invent wheel platform may exist ? 
great 
idea look available today . 
hydrogen leak 
shuttle find use software . 
ssme control simulation 
study , along real testing msfc handle labview . 

ton application , ability create `` virtual '' instrument 
accomplish specific custom task maker desire . 

addition ieee-488 support , computer become virtual control station , 
allow graphic representation remote instrumentation . 
serial 
support instrument anywhere . 
ground control software 
main control 1 utilize approach .
