charlie brett 's suggestion -- buy one disposable flash camera , use 
film , take thing apart -- good one . 
note , though , 
get particularly precise voltage thing , 
may single-point design adapt well operation . 
thing easy dismantle . 
key piece information 
advance film one , wind 
film cassette -- unwound cassette factory , 
camera make . 
darkroom need dismantle . 

standard film , take cassette processing . 
people bring one disposable 
rip apart , toss film cassette bin , 
throw battery one trashcan rest camera 
another . 
take apart , get aa alkaline battery 
still fair bit life kind little bit 
piece camera . 
expect could even re-use camera really 
determine .
