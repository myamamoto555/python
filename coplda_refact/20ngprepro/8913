say - require faith part 
say car drive see drive - 
fact - actually drive . 
require 
faith belief sens give accurate representation

existence non-existence god see

sorry remain skeptical - believe entirely 
conclusion . 
see evidence god 
correct - neither i. lack evidence existence 
something way evidence non-existence something 
creationist similar mode argumentation 
disprove evolution establish creation . 
personally never 
see neutrino , exist . 
`` pink unicorn '' analogy break 
rather naive . 
scientific theory explain 
appearance animal life - evolution . 
draw conclusion 
`` pink unicorn '' exist see , conclusion 
foundation observation theory . 
`` pink unicorn '' , 
exist , would qualitatively similar known entity . 
say , since good evidence life earth 
evolve `` primitive '' ancestor pink unicorn would share 
common horse zebra . 
god , however , 
correspondence anything imo . 
physical 
frame work observation draw conclusion .

disagree profoundly . 
define god 
existence - fact , define god . 
might 
get subject - although think relevant 
come back .

use wrong category - perhaps misunderstand 
say . 
make argument ever offer 
definition fallacy . 
try convince 
anything . 
believe - rest upon faith . 
inappropriate 
apply category logic realm unless someone tell 
logically prove god `` evidence '' ... , 
use logic disprove claim fine necessary . 
btw , incomplete argument fallacy - thing 
even wrong .

certainly one make observation 
thing know exist . 
still maintain one 
use observation infer `` god exist '' . 

positive assertion require leap .

, would reject concept anyway .

seem completely misunderstand . 

evidence '' ` god ' meaningful '' level . 
maybe 
response give come naturally 
many people try run private conception god 
throat . 
, however , . 
argue one , 
one , thing - make positive assertion something 
principle evidence 
require leap - require faith . 
, would say , 
`` theist '' ; however , form atheism respect - 
must found upon honesty .
