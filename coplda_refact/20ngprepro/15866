private network ? 
suspect government feel enough prevent company 
offer secure encryption service . 
big company take 
kind risk . 
visible much lose . 
us government may make encryption illegal prevent 
use . 
could credibly say ibm mit : receive us 
government money next year unless follow voluntary guideline 
use encryption , doubt either organization would delay make use 
encryption violation local policy . 
us government get much 
power make impractical operate without get money 
government put restriction use money would 
illegal enact law .
