jung may say , way speak 
catholic church . 
dogma assumption way mean mary 
consider god part `` godhead . '' 
therefore imply 
thing feminine general . 
also jung 's statement make sound though dogma 
announce `` blue . '' 
also incorrect , dogma 
formulation always part tradition . 
dogma 
always believe , formally define 
assumption declare _ ex cathedra _ statement .
