subject : re : med school admission 
organization : computer science department , stanford university . 
lines : 61 
fellow applicant situation much better . 
apply 
20 school , get two interview , get one offer , wait 
hear school . 
let honest experience impression medical 
school admission process . 
number gpa , mcat everything , 
probably important anything else . 
fact , 
school screen applicant base number never even look 
quality . 
course , happen , expect refund 
$ 50 application fee . 
, fact get four interview tell number 
well qualify academically . 
mention one response , 
acceptance , denial , ? 
assume worst , 
denial , still great probability acceptance somewhere . 

interview go ? 
long wait , call school never contact 
anything . 
many tell interview season 
hear , assume denial . 
many rejection 
letter send may late june . 
school 
still interview . 
really think worry . 
become 
fixate mailbox , go , fun , proud . 
people think medical school admission process ? 

mediocre gpa , high mcat score , work software 
engineer two year . 
major computer science stanford . 
still , 
think profile person best chance get admit 
something like : 
important 
-------------- 
gpa : 3.5 better 
mcat : top 15 % subject 
medium importance 
----------------- 
ability 
maturity 
motivation go medicine 
activity 
less important 
-------------- 
college university 
major 
work experience 
anything else want know 
anyway , good shape . 
think admission committee bind 
many way number , would like much understand 
person individual . 
sometimes practical . 
get 
four interview indicator number . 
hopefully , 
able impress character . 
good luck ,
