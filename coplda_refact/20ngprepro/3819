yes , public key system would almost 
impossible handle . 
might rsa , mean 
pkp get pay . 
1997 , pkp patent 
general concept public key encryption , well particular 
implementation know rsa . 
hmm , first thought use diffie-hellman exponential 
session key exchange , equivalent . 
however , diffie-hellman 
patent , like one public key system , claim 
equivalent , basic point stand . 
interestingly , quote jim bidzos show media real 
soon announcement , sound piss . 
maybe 
yet realize pkp might strike gold ? 

get someone admit general scheme clipper use .
