plenty 
head room , though . 
shorter people fit back without complaint , 
long seat sit behind pull forward bit 
give place put foot .

really enjoy moonroof , way , always sucker 
open air driving . 
leakage problem anything like ... yet ! 
> hear exhaust system trouble , mine work fine . 
hear one . 
know early probe 
'89 maybe ' 90 problem prematurely rusting muffler 
ford replace charge , hear anything like 
concern '93 probe . 
real trouble car outside cv joint boot 
leak , dealer take care promptly , even 
give free rental car day half without 
car . 
quite happy way handle ... especially consider 
expect worst ! 
hear , sound like qc problem 
probe probably mx-6 first go production , 
think problem mostly correct point . 

almost always expect completely new car like , though . 
hope help ,
