possible connect another internal hard disk 
macintosh find space put . 
come 
quantum 80 meg drive . 
run space problem , slap 
another 40 meg quantum sit shelf . 
. 
first , concern space . 
since drive quantum 
quarter height drive , finally decide logical place 
stack one upon . 
fine , fit snugly . 

problem heat yet , drive run together 
two month . 
next problem connect drive . 
spare internal 
hard disk power cable , half trouble . 

splice extra cable get one square motherboard 
connector two hard disk power connector . 
spare 
cable , buy wire connector find 
good electronics store $ 10 . 
would suggest properly 
connection reduce possibility 
shorts bad connection . 
next , need ribbon cable connection . 
, spare hard disk 
ribbon cable , want careful case word 
purchase crimp 50 pin cable connector give another 
male connector middle spare cable . 
part cost $ 10 , 
easily attach good wood vice . 
theory behind use 
crimp connector work , original cable 
damage , go back original setup . 
, could bother check dev note 
power consumption plug work like charm 
day . 
mac ii , everything work . 
careful id 's 
drive , ensure terminate resistor drive 
intact . 
try without terminate resistor 
seem logical splitting scsi chain , signal 
terminate end . 
let know question .
