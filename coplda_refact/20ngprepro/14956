install mc power arc ii , seem run great . 
also 
use mc coil , neither ignition module coil require 
new mount hole drill 92 . 
little soldering 
fine . 
static timing real easy set . 
side coin , local wrench , whose opinion 
invariably seek always adopt , think mc power arc `` piece 
shit '' say `` jap chip gon na fail one day '' . 
needless say , like electronic ignition module , 
recommend system . 
think one 
timing sensor , correct ?
