ask crucial question underlie much genocide . 
bosnian muslims slavic ethnicity . 
speak serbo-croatian . 

ideology whereby true slav christian 
anyone convert islam thereby must change ethnicity 
change religion . 
see poem novel ivo andric 
brilliantly display attitude part call 
`` people '' i.e. christian slav . 
reason , 
call bosnian muslims `` turks '' even though ethnically 
turk speak turkish first language . 
reason , 
actually genocide label ethnically 
identical religiously `` '' call , paradoxically , `` ethnic 
cleanse '' rather `` religious cleanse . '' 
thus , war rage serb croat continuation 
wwii , older agenda , annihilation islam muslims 
bosnian , carry cover serbo-croat war .
