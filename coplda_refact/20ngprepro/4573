onto hard disk , greatly speed thing make 
less annoying , spare 7 compress meg .

, . 
also go promote pandering 
corporate paranoia real issue convenience . 
like 
deal floppy . 
personally , use change 
registration info , see valid need , one ought 
solve use quick little utility rather half-hour 
reinstall guarantee mess setting one 
way another . 
, go put much time , 
procedure get way find encode information : 
1 . 
copy windows disk directory want 
install . 
use c : \ . 
2 . 
, copy directory something like c : \ . 
3 . 
install c : \ . 
4 . 
comp two directory determine change . 
i.e. , comp . 
\ . 
> \ 
5 . 
look report file file change . 
assume 
cover cover track , least one 
file difference note particular offset . 
locate 
say offset original directory see use hex 
editor , modify one . 
6 . 
far break code go ; 
really cryptography . 
probably xor key something ; 
think m concerned joe schmoe office personalize 
copy `` real pirate '' probably disassemble 
damned thing anyway . 
technique work 
obnoxious corporate product try write original 
floppy install ; extreme case may able 
back floppy hard disk , stick 
compare floppy lotus stuff probably like . 
note , afford space hard disk , 
much way customization , reinstall one 
directory another may less arduous . 
stuff 
mention may well void license microsoft , 
would ever find . 
careful disk editor , 
could also mung something important ... duh . 
guess 
disclaimer .
