w. petersen 
recently wright 's understanding question 
different direction . 
brief 1986 study william petersen find linguistic 
confusion use english word `` homosexual '' meaning 
. 
22 fault wright english bible 
render `` homosexual '' cor 6:9 tim 1:10 . 
sense petersen coalesce bailey , boswell , scroggs 
single assertion reiterate , effect , position bailey . 
find 
`` homosexual '' unacceptable translation anachronistic . 
`` 
major disjunction '' exist contemporary thought terminology 
thought paul 's time . 
`` disjunction '' ? 
base historical linguistic 
fact . 
accordingly , ancient greek roman society treat male sexuality 
polyvalent characterize person sexually sexual act . 
virtually form behavior , except transvestism , acceptable . 
christianity simply add category `` natural '' `` unnatural '' 
describe action . 
ancient society know nothing category 
`` homosexual '' `` heterosexual , '' assume , word dover 
quote approvingly petersen , `` everyone respond different time 
homosexual heterosexual stimulus ... '' 188 . 
23 
contrast , modern usage virtually limit term `` homosexual '' 
desire propensity . 
k.m. benkert , 1869 coin german term 
equivalent `` homosexual , '' use refer orientation , 
preference `` nothing sexual act '' 189 . 
petersen proceed cite `` supplement oxford english 
dictionary , '' define `` homosexual '' propensity desire 
mention act . 
petersen 's point use `` homosexual '' 
, one wrongfully read modern concept back early history 
`` equivalent concept exist '' 189 . 
consequently translation 
inaccurate `` include celibate homophile , ... incorrectly 
heterosexual engage homosexual act ... incorrectly include 
female homosexual '' 19 89 . 
prior 1869 `` cognitive structure , 
either society antiquity , within modern bifurcation 
humanity ` homosexual ' ` ' make sence '' 189 . 
foregoing clarify petersen feel translatio 
`` homosexual '' mistaken . 
yet possible petersen one 
mistaken , historical linguistic philological grounds ? 
next 
phase paper critically examine petersen 's position . 
justification translate 
`` homosexuals '' 
historical grounds 
refutation foregoing opposition 
`` homosexual '' begin historical cultural evidence . 
since 
virtually everyone acknowledge word appear paul 's 
usage , historical setting earlier available . 
yet much writing 
reveal ancient understanding homosexuality prior contemporary 
paul . 
goal discover ancient conceive 
homosexuality , particularly homosexual orientation , way similar 
present-day concept . 
peterson , bailey , boswell , scroggs claim homosexual 
condition , desire , propensity , inversion - whatever call - 
part definition term . 
assert either term 
limit act particular kind boswell , active male prostitute ; 
scroggs , pederasty homosexual condition unknown ancient 
time bailey ; petersen . 
follow discussion show neither 
position legitimate . 
attention devote latter postion 
first former one address `` linguistic grounds . '' 
regard latter position , one may rightfully ask , 
homosexual condition exist 1869 ? 
modern phenomenon ? 
yet 
universal , allege today , must exist always include 
ancient time , even though lack sophistication discuss . 
indeed , evidence show ancient , pre-christian christian , 
know total spectrum sexual behavior , include form 
same-sex activity transvestism include , also same-sex 
orientation condition . 
petersen admit 190 n. 10 plato 
`` symposium '' may `` sole possible exception '' ancient 
condition . 
discount , however , believe even 
`` act appear decide factor . '' 
however , 
significant exception , hardly worthy call `` exception , '' 
follow additional evidence homosexual condition . 
`` symposium '' plato give strongest evidence 
knowledge homosexual condition . 
24 plato posit third sex 
comprise `` '' . 
hence `` original nature '' 
palaus physis , consist three kind human . 
zeus slice 
human half , weaken would threat 
god . 
consequently person seek half , either one 
opposite sex one sex . 
plato quote : 
, , tally man , since every one show like 
flatfish trace slice two ; ever 
search tally fit . 
man section 
composite sex first call 
; adulterer mostly descend sex , 
whence likewise derive woman adulteress . 
woman section woman great fancy man : 
rather woman , stock . 
man section male pursue masculine , long 
boyhood last show slice male 
make man delight lie 
clasp man 's ; finest boy stripling , 
manly nature . 
say shameless 
creature , falsely : behavior due shamelessness 
daring , manliness , virility , since quick welcome 
like . 
sure evidence fact reach maturity 
alone prove public career man . 
come 
man 's estate , natural interest 
get child thing stress 
custom ; quite contented live together unwedded day . 
man sort rate bear lover boy 
willing mate man , eagerly greet kind . 
well , 
one - whether lover sort - 
happen particular half , two wondrously 
thrill affection intimacy love , hardly 
induce leave 's side single moment . 

continue together throughout life , though could 
even say would one another 25

aristophanes even speak `` mutual love ingrain mankind

noteworthy 
speech socrates devote much attention explain desire 
related love object . 
desire feel ``

object desire love . 
socrates clearly distinguish ``

summary , virtually every element modern discussion love 
homosexuality anticipate symposium plato . 
petersen error 
claim ancient could think homosexual act , 
inclination orientation . 
widespread evidence support 
latter . 
27 
biblical support homosexuality inclination context 
homosexual act add case ancient distinction .
