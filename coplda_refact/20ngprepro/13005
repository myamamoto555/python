think `` obvious '' `` lot '' people willing 
pay price . 
sure someone 
fact trend attendance regard percentage capacity 
sell . 
even trend relatively flat , consider 
happen basis . 
tv money dry , franchise seek supplant 
lose revenue alternative source . 
one best source may 
ticket sale . 
example 1 : dodgers 
dodgers count strong base season ticket sale 
probably believe ability raise 
price without hinder revenue . 
certainly think 
true . 
example 2 : padres 
lucky average 10,000 fan game year . 
raise price , less . 
want increase 
overall revenue base , best thing put 
win team field . 
give happen 
, probably make money lower ticket 
price run frequent promotion . 
? 
idea . 
increase price , 
work . 
> 2 even assume strange power make owner 
> decrease ticket price , decrease tv contract . 
strange power work force market place . 
team 's market somewhat different , owner go 
face unique set circumstance deal 
market force . 
manager , would never want lower 
price , sometimes strategy necessary , sometimes work . 
consider everything want continue success .
