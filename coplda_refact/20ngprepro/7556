let explore interesting paragraph point point , sentence 
sentence . 
1 talk origin , merely science . 
origin ? 
speak origin life , human 
species , universe , physical law , biological diversity ? 
2 science explain origin . 
false statement unless carefully qualify . 
depend 
origin talk . 
3 person exclude anything science issue origin 
say higher truth science . 
, false statement . 
begin , notion `` higher 
truth '' distinctly dubious . 
many people believe way 
ascertain truth science ; even 
believe way reliable certain . 
many 
believe truth express use language 
science . 
let . 
truth neither `` higher '' 
`` lower '' ; simply true . 
point , restrict one 's discussion origin science 
reject source knowledge ; simply restrict 
scope discussion . 
4 false premise . 
intend assert previous sentence false 
4 actually true . 
however context identify another 
false least theologically unsound statement . 
5 way , enjoy science . 
evidence mr. rawlins lack sufficient understanding science 
enjoy science meaningful sense . 
one might well say 
one enjoy literature write language one read . 
however one mark sentence false -- follow analogy , 
perhaps like pretty shape letter . 
6 truly wonder observe god 's creation . 
let quibble ; count one true . 
7 macroevolution mixture 15 percent science 85 percent 
religion guarantee within three percent error 
still another false statement . 
however one make come true 
follow contextual modification : 
`` macroevolution , misunderstand , mixture 15 percent 
rawlins erroneously think science , 85 percent 
rawlins erroneously think religion . '' 
----- 
distinctly noticeable mr. rawlins fail miserably touch 
truth except report personally feel . 

justice assume misinform 
personal reaction . 
one account hypothesis 
idiosyncratic personal concept truth .
