worry ; go cheat something 
get catch . 
key size one thing 
verify externally . 
feed lot random pair 
chip , try flip random key bit , see happen 
output . 
already know happen -- half output 
bit vary , average , 1-bit key change input change . 
build weak cryptosystem , might case 
bit much less powerful , sense 
enter encryption late game . 
contrast , 
des design use key bit early possible ; 50 % output 
change rate appear early round 5 . 
, though , think 
nsa go cheat crudely ; likely get catch . 
remember promise let committee outside expert see 
cryptosystem design . 
assume something , bias 
generation schedule stick like sore thumb . 
committee 
run lot test , retain output . 
verify 
later chip . 
yes , civilian community least 
secure storage facility think even nsa get without 
notice , fort meade get transporter work . 
oops -- think suppose talk ... committee 
member even retain secure copy code -- two half , 
xor together recover program ... 
seriously , , think , problem whole scheme . 

people invent stupid , crypto game 
game far longer . 

go lie way detect easily , since credibility 
thing use sell system . 
lie 
civilian committee , one believe absence 
back door . 
lie key size , one 
believe copy programming disk u key . 
lie obvious aspect strength cryptosystem , 
one believe escrow agency cahoots . 
say lie thing 
anyway . 
certainly claim nsa build cryptosystem 
back door committee find -- look long take 
folk believe s-box sabotage . 
entirely 
possible committee release ambiguous report , 
reason . 
subtle point i.e. , one explain 
senator ... .

like unit key generation process better . 
however -- s1 s2 suppose control 
escrow agent . 
trust keep seed value secure , 
trust keep secure . 
still know s1 s2 change . 
think see 
something constant , reread denning 's technical 
information post , say anything , one way .
