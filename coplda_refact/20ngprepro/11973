say think first time 
something post oppose without make personal 
insult . 
tim . 
think people answer 
factual part esp . 
internal 
conflict policy . 
israel often get away 
nation due u.s. veto . 

familiar every instance know reason saudi 
arabia condemn pilgrim 
pilgrim iranian . 
yes , un bias mostly 
favor us ally include israel , saudi arabia 
pakistan `` outlaw '' country like iran 
recently iraq . 
far support repressive 
government think get slack israel 
thing `` wrong '' . 
reason condemnation 
occur lie race country victim . 

gas iraqi kurd get associate iran war 
since iran perceive worse iraq condemnation 
result . 
palestinian kill arab country involve 
another case care . 
seem recently 
one care many palestinian die anywhere include 
israel occupied territory . 
appreciate lack personal insult .
