yesterday , response henry spencer 's question 
temperature blackbody interstellar space , say `` dust grain 
act blackbody , k. '' well , dead 
wrong . 
local interstellar dust expert , bruce , 
inform dust grain _ _ good radiator far ir , 
warm ; actually , ambient radiation field 
distant star bring true blackbody 3 4 kelvin . 
sorry , henry , anyone else mislead . 
obviously , time 
take another ism class : - 
news , alan stern southwest research institute give 
talk binary system yesterday . 
give brief 
overview system parameter volume ratio 
8:1 , mass ratio 15:1 , plus lot ... 
give thought formation . 
idea 
lot lot small planetesimal outer 
solar system , mass distribute power law kind ; 
time , planetesimal accrete larger body . 
get 
scatter solar system close encounter jupiter 
saturn , many accrete gas giant , especially 
uranus neptune . 
large planetesimal capture neptune - 
call triton capture ? 
perhaps collision smaller , 
already-existing neptunian moon , perhaps close passage 
neptune 's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking ! 
. 
note two recently discover `` kuiper belt '' object , 
1992 qb1 1993 fw , plus chiron , 
mass , identify group 
larger body triton . 
, think , 
form impact body hit , knock material 
ring around pluto later accrete charon ; similar 
idea formation earth 's moon . 
good evidence 
spectrum surface pluto charon different 
pluto methane frost , charon , use evidence 
impact theory . 
believe may around 1000 object 
remain relatively stable dynamical zone outside neptune 's 
orbit , beyond 35 au . 
1992 qb1 1993 fw first member 
population find , model . 
note body 
dark , since surface cover methane 
frost , dark , long-chain hydrocarbon 
. 
reason pluto high albedo around 0.5 , think 
surface warm enough around perihelion sublimate , 
atmosphere freeze , thirty year later , form 
bright , new frost . 
body much farther away 30 au go 
hard see . 
hope make error transcription ; see 
howling mistake , undoubtedly mine , . 
way , one top gun behind pluto fast flyby 
mission think , say current plan use 
titan 4 send probe `` rectilinear trajectory '' 
pluto speak loosely time ... . 
would like 
use proton , give slightly smaller velocity cost 
much less . 
figure : $ 500 million 2 titan 4 launch 
two separate probe , launch separately , $ 120 million 
2 proton launch . 
tell story soviets originally 
offer sell proton launch $ 30 million , force 
increase price us order allow 
marketplace . 
tell say .
