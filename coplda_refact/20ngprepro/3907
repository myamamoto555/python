okay , look faq see , know 
come ... 
suppose follow order : 
try find exact match read-only color cell . 
within hardware limit 
try allocate read-only set match . 
else fail , 
return best match read-only color 
already allocate . 
sound good theory . 
seem work way 
though . 
exact match already , 
unallocated cell , fail , even 
already allocate several cell already , dozen 
read-only cell already . 
bug ? 
feature ? 
misunderstanding part ? 
help appreciate ,
