centaur build t4 would better bet integrate 
onto proton design extremely harsh 
t4 launch . 
also closer 4 m diameter . 
hit real kicker , however . 
centaur pressure stabilize . 
hold weight without pressure tank . 
additionally , 
pressure difference two tank must maintain ~ + - 5 psus . 
rather tight rock roll train . 
pressure 
stabilization centaur achieve performance . 
numerous occasion 
af want see would take make 
stabilize centaur . 
answer -- centaur worth launch . 
require integration , however 
. 
believe integration great extent due 
cleanliness requirement pfl configuration , maybe something

addition facility critical centaur top 
lift . 
facility also need . 
know proton use 
fuel , since derive icbm 's would suspect 
use storable propellant ullage problem cryo 's 
. 
cryo sight , addition system 
could big $ $ , mention real tech transfer issue involve 
provide centaur gse russia . 
issue alone might enough kill 
idea .
