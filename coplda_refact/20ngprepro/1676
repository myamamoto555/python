would hope intend reasonable discussion might 
wait express opinion decide flame . 
` war ' sure would define . 
look attack 
village way decide start . 
would 
count riot 20 's 30 's ? 
violence war . 
personally 
think ` war ' , oppose civil disturbance whatever , require 
organization , planning measure semi-regular force . 
perhaps arab liberation army count . 
could easily convince 
. 
know great deal plan let alone 
organization . 
haganah palmach certainly . 
cause 
criticism , merely reflect great organization generally 
` zionist ' camp . 
> course , war , since arabs attack . 
silly ? 
case war start 
invasion arab armies . 
see agree something . 
previous poster wrong , ? 
> like last week fatah launch katyusha rocket 
> northern israel . 
uprising end war begin ? 
sure , doubt want opinion anyway , think 
war require organization say . 
need group command 
plan . 
fatah lauch rocket southern lebanon 
sure right group - moslems ? 
sound 
like war . 
stone throw .
