hope silicon jock committee follow 
algorithm hardware . 
doubt nsa would pull 
monkey business point -- expect 
chip reverse-engineered sooner later -- obvious 
opportunity introduce additional hole . 
chip place pull monkey business - 
key generation , either mathematical backdoor , 
program laptop supposedly generate 
key also save copy s1 s2 leak somehow , 
program supposedly put official key 
chip actually put different key hard detect , 
since escrow agent either trust nsa laptop 
give key , still know algorithm . 
factory make copy key . 
whatever .
