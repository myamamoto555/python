work project provide emergency management 
information system . 
keep classic command 
control type system , consider develop dual screen monitor 
system order provide status board monitor . 
number x level question regard : 
unix system use . 
platform 
predominantly sun 's , probably port well . 
assume standard dual monitor system configure 
talk one x display multiple screen , 
multiple x display . 
give : 
- change input focus one screen simple 
track mouse one screen ? 

nothing special need shift focus 
screen ? 
- run separate window manager separate 
screen multiscreen window manager ? 
; sell ... 
- multi-screen window manager way grab 
window frame move window one screen next ? 
- way application transparently see 
multiple screen one logical x-y plane , hardware 
provide screen start 0,0 ? 
- thought difficulty involve design 
system capable use either multiple screen single 
screen perhaps run virtual window manager simulate 
multiple screen instead ? 
assume major issue - rely 
provide config file specify 
configuration screen placement window 
application . 
thought suggestion past experience 
welcome .
