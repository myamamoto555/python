application particularly work fine . 
however , open 
second application , suddenly start either window , 
give error : unable load iso 8859-1 font . 
difference two window initial 
one reference different name file , prettier 
color slight change . 
investigation show 
open default cause behavior , significant , 
x application longer load font invoke 
command line either window . 
start different 
font use - fn option , problem . 
would seem 
default load font somehow cause server lose 
font .

rewrite file use different 
font hope best , anyone idea ?
