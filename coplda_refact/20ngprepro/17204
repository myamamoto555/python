think illuminate . 
let make first 
suggestion . 
arabic word , especially technical one , become use 
let define , especially atheist , may 
terribly familiar . 
please also note though initially refer 
khomeini heretic understand claim -- reject 
since -- personal infallibility , withdraw basis 
statement . 
conditionally retain reference regard 
khomeini 's advocacy thesis infallibility 
so-called `` twelve imams , '' clear conflict qur ` 
place twelve imams category behavior example 
higher muhammad , qur ` show 
prophet clearly fallible , well appear , give 
abstruse theological statment regard `` nature '' twelve 
imam place different metaphysical category 
remainder humanity , possible exception muhammad , 
something verge sin association .
