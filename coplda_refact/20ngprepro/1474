understand problem correctly , want way send 
exposure manager widget code draw xlib 
graphic window . 
sound like might want send exposure use 
specify region . 
know region need 
send exposure , generally bound rectangle object , 
use create region , add 
new object polygon region , either use region 
clip gc redraw use test 
object need redrawn . 
keep mind stack order 
overlap object affect look . 
hope help
