recapitulate bit : 
- essence marriage two people 's commitment . 
- two people claim marry `` heart '' 
willing marriage recognize church state , 
prima facie evidence commitment really . 
- obvious situation christian marriage possible 
without civil church wedding : strand desert 
island , state forbid marriage unjust reason 
e.g. , law interracial marriage . 
- legal concept `` common-law marriage '' mean ensure 
state recognize marriage start 
usual ceremony record-keeping . 
- pastorally , concerned people use `` marry 
god 's eye '' excuse live together without formal wedding . 
one duty one 's marriage properly record witness . 
- also people wedding ceremony 
without make genuine commitment , therefore marry 
god 's eye . 
right ?
