since mosfet 1972 vintage , probably good one 
today 's standard . 
idea voltage current 
rating , e.g. @ 6a , probably get away replace 
anything better spec . 
early mosfets voltage rating 
approximately + - 20 , would usually turn completely `` '' 
+10 vdc . 
otherwise , mosfet really mysterious -- 
less voltage controlled current source . 
mosfet circuit 
use open-loop , voltage control current source , may 
experiment various technique .
