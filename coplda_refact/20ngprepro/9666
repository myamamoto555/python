perish thought ... know , may right , least far 
major league professional sport team go . 
seem 
become big money game , much previous time . 

think ever able move back home several year , 
may ahl team , best ... sigh . 
interesting thing nhl also expand , 
time dramatically increase amount money need 
operate team . 
would seem indicate big 
occur next year , unless player salary 
somehow bring control . 
frankly , see 
nhl 's current drive expansion supportable current 
operating condition . 
revenue sharing salary cap come 
nhl soon , look .
