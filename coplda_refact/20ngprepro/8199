logic anything , ... 
see liability put sticker car move , 
something , bdi choose start drive car 
known unsafe condition would seem liable . 
furthermore , 
would last chance avoid unsafe situation , 
additional factor attribute `` blame '' . 
anyway , sticker window less effective ... one problem 
take blade window remove stubborn sticker , different 
story nice paint job door ...
