propose theory month 
ago . 
let 's take one step , even . 
, survey show , 
33 % man homosexual encounter , must 
even larger percentage people homosexual erotic 
fantasy . 
less 10 % population gay , 
say people identify gay demonstrate 
gay potential . 
obviously , large chunk people choose , 
accurately , force choose force religion social 
sanction put feeling aside , heterosexual . 
obviously , cramer fall category . 
people one hang `` choice . '' 
obviously , since choose , everyone must , homosexual 
flaunt `` perversion '' choose go along 
society dictate . 
course , awful pervert . 
choose , gleefully 
admit heterosexual meet right man choose 
indulge homoerotic potential . 
take ! 
elf !!!
