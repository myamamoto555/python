really mean imply ninja better duc . 
talk duc owner owner particular 
say power something less overwhelming . 
say , 
would love . 
guess bit 
specific . 
something weigh 750 , go 
extra cube . 
think fact show care maximum 
power slug though exclusion everything else . 
note 
handling important . 
buy ninja 
could afford duc . 
mean ruffle feather , 'll probably get next 
year ...
