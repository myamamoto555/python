, fact , ferreira 's original strategy , troika 
proceed simply continue implement . 
exactly radical 
shift policy oust something people seem forget . 

real question whether well ferreira could 
stay , whether basic strategy flaw since ferreira 
say go something different anaheim 
duck , guess good practice paper , 
tweaking bit second time around . 
one also wonder 
whether strategy would lot better 
injury , whether complain weather 
earthquake collapse root cellar .

besides , marginal contributor . 
let 's also forget ferreira come close trading kelly 
, , rumor hear true , strong 
objection aspect shark management probably lot 
ouster three-headed , consensus orient gm . 
imagine , second , sharks would today fax machine 
jam .

especially unhappy player play well . 

would accuse mullen tank , motivation simply , 
kind thing affect team . 
example season , bring trial basis 
keep , age . 
think decent 
contributor worth keep around . 
youth movement advantage ; look gaudreau 
might still kc veteran keep around . 

find right balance . 
> right balance ? 
issue . 
exactly . 
time let go , yet major injury 
bug kill later . 
would much rather around someone 
like dean kolstad , point , choice . 
since 
choice one vs. someone like john carter , think 
right choice make time period .
