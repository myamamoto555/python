get tempest receiver lab , difficulty 
pick individual monitor . 
engineering tolerance slack enough 
tend radiate different frequency . 
even overlap , 
discriminate different line synch frequency - 
lock one average . 
signal weird case , vary polarisation sort 
interaction building . 
move fold dipole around also 
highly effective mean switching one monitor 
another ,
