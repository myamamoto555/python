maybe cyclical best word . 
one aspect . 

case virgin birth prophecy , apply , 
also prophetically christ . 
army threaten king would 
cease threat short time . 
yet also prophecy 
christ . 
several prophecy refer christ also application 
time make . 
`` egypt call son '' refer 
israel , prophetically christ . 
`` heathen rage '' 
say david also christ . 
another example would scripture quote judas , `` 
let another take . '' 
another example something isaiah say 
disciple also apply christ hebrews , `` child thou 
hast give . '' 
preterist view account phenomenon .
