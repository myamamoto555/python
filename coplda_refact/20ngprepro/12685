never ridden pillion much recently excellent 
experience dave edmondson pilot london . 
find upset bike much less ride pilot , 
, look shoulder anticipate hold 
hard brake acceleration . 
try always look 
inside shoulder corner move little possible , leave 
dave manage bike normally would bike 
luggage . 
hard acceleration quite unnerving feeling spit 
back hard fight . 
similarly , hold grab handle 
tightly dave need brake mash pulp 
lot bigger ... . 
reach around push 
tank seem like would awkward make even harder 
manage . 
rare occasion carry passenger , absolutely 
refuse carry anyone properly ride . 

helmet , jacket , glove , stout pants minimum . 

responsibility provide gear , responsibility 
require want ride . 
agree earlier poster : much experience 
carry particular passenger especially carry 
many passenger , take gentler ride duration 
head difficult road like . 
hamilton . 

nasty place find trouble .
