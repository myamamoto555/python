vote : 
team mvp : pat verbeek . 
fan 25 % goal mouth feed , still 
36 goal terrible start sp ? 
team captain 
throughout tough couple season . 
honorable mention : nick kypreos 
mark janssens . 
probably appropriate unsung hero category 
mvp , kypreos 17 goal , 320 + pim hardest working player 
team janssens underrate defensive center checker . 
guess 
place greater emphasis hard work skill determine value . 
biggest surprise : geoff sanderson . 
13 goal 31 point last season 
center , move left wing far put 45 goal 80 + 
point . 
new whaler record 21 power play goal , come 
right wing faceoff circle , garden spot . 
honorable mention : andrew 
cassels terry yake . 
kiddie quartet sanderson , poulin , nylander , 
petrovicky attract attention , cassels 23 
score close 90 point season . 
quite nicely assume 
role number one center team work well sanderson . 
yake 
bounce around minor number season still 24 put 
20 goal 50 point season . 
yake , like sanderson , start 
perform better offensively convert center wing , 
although lefty sanderson go left wing righty yake go 
right side . 
biggest disappointment : hand , john cullen . 
cullen disasterous 77 
point season last year , first full season trade . 
cullen start 
season summer back surgery , fall flat face appropriate , 
since spend whaler career flat ass , whine . 
cullen score 9 point 19 game , clubhouse malcontent , command 
powerplay 9 % success percentage > 21 % sanderson , sulk 
way town . 
worst , 4 year , $ 4m contract three year leave 
run , one would give 2nd round draft pick 
maple leafs offer hartford . 
honorable mention : steve , also subpar 
sign 3 year , $ 2.1 m contract ; eric weinrich , show flash 
competence , overall play poorly ; jim mckenzie , much better 
hockey player two season ago ; frank pietrangelo , 
seem play well sean burke extended period get 
make number start row .
