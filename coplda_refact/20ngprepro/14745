hart trophy orginally award time people think 
term `` best '' player , rather term 
valuable team . 
`` valuable team '' , 
, consider synonymous `` best '' . 
talk time 
honor attitude , measurable skill , important asset 
player bring team , league sport . 

onslaught professionalism clearly denigrate 
formerly foremost peacetime pursuit glory . 
hart trophy prize . 
honor .
