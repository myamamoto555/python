repost summarize , information additional comment . 
long 
16mb memory 25 mhz , intel math coprocessor , 
hard drive free compression . 
run 
3.1 , windows 3.1 enhance mode , ram drive , 
smart drive , swap file permanent temporary 
several month . 
interested faster 4.0 , concern report 
swap file requirement legitimacy mathsoft 's claim increase 
speed . 
users : 
4.0 run without swap file , insist use swap file ? 
far , response less detailed description setup , 
unrelated posting , informed answer , net e-mail , 
appear : 
1 david a. 
accord mathsoft , . 
use swap file extensively 
overburden physical resource . 
say actually 
win32 feature . 
figure 10mb indicate minimum . 

might try anyway ! 
2 bert tyler 
certain culprit . 

16mb main memory less 2mb 
bit dos session open part startup process , 
run without . 
install 
win32 subsystem march beta nt sdk , subsystem 
demand presence . 
win32 program 
run date 32-bit version freecell come 
subsystem . 

give windows small temporary leery file must 
remain fix location hard disk , seem well . 
3 brian c. anderson 
win32 ? 
upgrade 4.0 install directory 
win32 \ window \ system . 
upgrade tell win32 
require . 
4 steven v 
4.0 make use win32 library . 
probably 
hear win32 , 32-bit windows library provide 
much windows nt functionality support thread 
multitasking run windows 3.1 . 
5 thomas c. rhyne 
also 16 mb ram , indeed 4.0 insist permanent 
; would run otherwise . 
6 greg bishop 
3 absolutely require 4mb ram swap file 8mb ram 
8mb swap file . 
give enough memory error 
swap file less 8mb . 
major resource hog . 

load symbolic processor smart math , take ram 
real virtual load , due win32 library . 


seem addition system requirement show mathsoft 's 
advertisement 4.0 , need swap file , possibly big . 

look like would need 8mb swap file , would need choose 
? 
faster permanent swap file , slower temporary swap file 

apparently win32 subsystem ship 4.0 - much disk space 
require ? 



also receive answer : 
1 dale hample 
get 16 meg ram , configure ram disk 
? 
dos 6 permit different bootup configuration . 


4.0 + win32 configure use ram drive instead 
swap file ? 
, see use dos 6.0 alternate bootup 
would provide windows swap file . 
time back remember 
discussion issue use ram drive support swap file , 
think involve slower , < 8mb system . 


dos 6.0 various reason yet full installation . 


way , full installation dos 6.0 require avail oneself 
`` alternate bootup '' feature ? 
file installation disk 
require ? 



2 
, mean without _ permanent _ swap file . 
windows need 
swap file , upo create one permanent one exist . 
permanent generally faster though . 
know would 
happy either type -- ver . 
3.0 program conform 
win specification . 


far , 16mb enough ram avoid overhead run swap 
file - run 3.1 windows 3.1 without one .
