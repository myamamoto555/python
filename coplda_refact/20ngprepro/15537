think treat raw datum . 
. 

> compress . 
actually , digital hdtv system far higher bandwidth 
need , unless reason must work 
hdtv . 
also , calculation frame well , 
even use 24 bit actually need - 15 
18 enough move picture . 
3.5 mb 
guess hdtv resolution - may bit wider 1600 , fairly 
sure 1100 number digital proposal . 
hope fast memory system well - 
display require heavily interleaved vram system . 
unless _ _ compelling reason , would advise try use 
least somewhat compress datum . 
go full compression 
get level datum io requirement much cheaper easier 
deal .
