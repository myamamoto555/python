give fact , spacecraft attitude knowledge 
approx . 
2 arcmin , might able figure well 
determine location rotational gamma ray burster knowledge 
all-sky map 's accuracy . 
pr material three instrument 
give accuracy order `` fraction degree '' , 
help .

alone always use determine position . 

particularly bright burst occur , couple detector 
catch go . 
pioneer 10 11 one get . 

puppy far enough away , bright burst happen nearby , huge 
annulus create hopefully intersect line general circle give 
, get moderately accurate position . 
say oh , 2 3 
degree . 
closest anyone ever get . 
actually , advisor , another classmate mine , talk 
day put one detector one pluto satellite . 
realize satellite alone carry something like 200 
pound eq . 
well , detector need lead shield protect , 1 
alone weigh 200 pound . 
decide .
