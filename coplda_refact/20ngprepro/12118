one space walk , use second canadarm remove array . 
may want put hubble back payload bay reboost , 
want clip panel time . 
gamma-ray observatory , one design requirement 
spring , explosive squib , gas shock , 
etc. use deployment . 
partially everything could 
reel back put back payload bay , partially 
safety consideration . 
hear wing cruise missile 
would cut half stand swath open . 
back shuttle would go every day cost 
orbit $ 3.95 per pound , everybody design thing easy servicing .
