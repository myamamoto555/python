may misunderstanding term . 
believe `` jesus 
'' originally context baptism . 
folk 
believe baptism mention 
jesus , rather father , son , holy spirit . 
may 
doctrinal implication , far know mean 
folk deny existence divinity father . 

right one describe theology , fact think may 
several , include would classically call monophysite 
arian two rather different view , well belief 
probably consistent trinitarian standard , 
use trinitarian language misunderstand simply 
biblical .
