anyone check : let 's restrict christian , 
want find `` commandment '' book regard scripture ? 

go ? 
pass answer whether dismissive 
open kind issue deal -- question 
theological point involve ? 
quote `` '' often 
enough believe take seriously , jesus say 
say , `` love , obey command . '' 
john 14:15 
, like christian , slave christ , 
. 
also , instead younger brother , 
still direction , though call god `` abba . '' 
christian , 
therefore , try find lord command , 
discover feel obligated , confess failure . 
reader may set aside jargon `` slave 
christ '' -- point adherent religion read text 
whether classify `` inspired '' hold model , 
effort find application situation . 
practice range 
`` devotional '' reading sermon like exegesis canon - 
ical scripture `` word god . '' 
highest pitch , lead 
question whether find inspired scripture something 
act `` absolute '' guidance action . 
problem find lord command . 

go set aside essay one major direction christian 
look command , namely christian tradition . 

reject tradition , primary audience essay 
protestants , deny tradition determinative value , favor 
witness scripture . 
question want deal , commandment 
find lord scripture ? 
turn hard 
question . 
protestant inquisitor would like turn 
discussion authority tradition , accomodate , unlike 
protestants , episcopalians admit claim scripture b reason 
c tradition roughly equal standing . 
earlier john quote , read john 13:34 `` give new 
commandment : love one another . '' 
place nt 
christian give explicit commandment , context comment 
imperative mode pronouncement jesus . 
meal 
reader infer , since john , synoptics jesus 
say , `` take bread ; body . '' 
mark 14:22 , cf. matthew , 
luke , 1 corinthians 11:24 mode imperative greek _ _ , 
hence , , `` commandment . '' 
case infer command direct wider 
circle immediate collocation disciple -- judge 
evangelist 's point mention disciple mostly 
entirely dead expect follow commandment 
lord . 
case communion , paul 's mention least ; 
probably true evangelist also imply ongoing ritual liturgy 
word operate `` bind '' christian original command 
disciple , continue commandment christian community . 
entirely comfortable inference , must point 
, occasion jesus speak command . 
take clear inference , least evangelist 's notion , 
christian call love one another , jesus ' command 
direct disciple . 
call attention inference . 
command apply without generalization specific 
context statement context `` disciple '' christ . 
reading scripture make inference , get sense 
text whatsoever . 
general problem read text 
-- read without understanding native 
language normally read translate text , without 
appreciation original context point , original 
language , english mislead . 
go presume , follow , 
general problem read scripture control 
really think true , suffice current 
purpose . 
address issue arise already 
cope understanding 2000 year old text another world 
one live . 
question level introduce reser - 
commandment issue find stipulate 
read text original audience might . 
among reason see john 's _ _ general 
commandment merely instruction jesus disciple 
one occasion , one link synoptic `` great commandment '' 
criticism , jesus , limit love 
congenially associate . 
matthew 5:43 ff read , `` learn 
say : ` must love neighbor ' hate enemy . 

say : love enemy . '' 
fact , leviticus context quote 
say ` hate enemy ' -- merely common human presumption . 
leviticus pain say `` love '' extend stranger 
amongst people israel . 
luke , expand q context , 
go jesus say . 
`` even sinner love love . '' 
6:27 
suggest quite strongly , would say limit 
scope `` new commandment '' quite jesus mind . 

short , inference lead generalize actual text command 
`` force '' christian , object limit 
christian . 
trickier _ _ institution communion , 
case `` great commission '' matthew 10 , mark 6 twelve 
send evangelize , `` proclaim kingdom heaven close 
hand . '' 
verb imperative _ ke : _ , context rather 
specific twelve , specifier `` 
turn step pagan territory , enter samaritan town '' 
-- lukan parallel even specific jesus ' final journey 
jerusalem make harder see generalize christian 
previous example . 
prevent christian make 
inference ; call attention inference 
justified text , unlike first two case cite 
rhetoric evangelist urge reader . 
still , paul seem 
feel oblige `` proclaim kingdom heaven close hand '' 
even contrary jesus ' instruction 12 gentile , 
end earth . 
, christian also take 
`` commandment '' sense john 14:15 . 
`` accept '' ? 

know . 
surely rather speculative . 
see ripple 
inference spread text pretext -- christian may 
infer general commandment , applicable , present 
gospel specific occasion . 
necessarily object 
kind generalization -- insist people make must 
understanding reasoning considerable 
length actually scripture . 
assumption 
involve reasoning , scriptural 
though people best `` justify '' assumption 
reference scripture -- simply add inference mix ! 
let 's move `` great commandment '' -- love god 
whole heart mind soul . 
, perhaps , synoptic 
`` equivalent '' john 's _ _ . 
yet , present 
commandment , text . 
rather , context controversy 
pharisees . 
cite matthew ff 
`` pharisees hear silence 
get together , disconcert , one put question , 
`` master , greatest commandment law ? '' 
means obvious though accept jesus ' 
answer mean commandment christian . 
answer 
polemic enemy . 
mark 's account , 12:28 -34 cast answer 
far positive light `` scribe '' version say 
`` far important holocaust need point word 
originate context animal sacrifice ; forget nazis 
sacrifice . '' 
luke intermediate -- lawyer pose question 
`` disconcert '' jesus , get good samarian parable pain 
luke 10:25 -37 . 
context confusingly various one 
could forgive draw inference account 
say obviously take commandment binding 
christian -- though think entirely reasonable conclusion 
case jesus think . 
point mental gear 
grind cycle get conclusion 
command , jesus . 
contingent 
understand point jesus ' use torah quite 
different gospel account , application context . 
different context among synoptic curious . 
note 
luke get `` fix '' command parable 
good samaritan . 
may look analogous intent matthew , 
7:12 give `` golden rule '' `` meaning law prophets '' 
may also hear echo hillel say , generation 
jesus . 
make association think entirely 
reasonable , -- -- indulge inference . 
text 
explicitly support ; rather , read text kind 
. 
current literary theory call `` intertextuality . '' 
discussion _ _ `` '' apply beyond 
community disciple , circle christian believer , 
apply , buttress conclusion despite 
presentation say explicitly `` commandment '' christian . 
christian would disagree conclusion -- must point 
conclusion , depend rather elaborate chain 
reasoning simply present text , . 
contextual problem keep come , severely look 
saying jesus universally take christian 
commandment . 
get really hard case . 
take divorce . 
mark 
pretty clear , `` man divorce wife marry another guilty 
adultery . '' 
10:11 , cf. luke 16:18 -- except matthew 
escape clause `` except case fornication '' , 5:31 . 

seem rather clear `` commandment '' whether take matthew 's 
reservation ; christian , day , take . 
, 
least practice . 
rather peculiar ; jesus 
explicit whereas say nothing 
thing people gnash tooth . 
possible , command 
christ clear , matthew disagree evangelist 
synoptic tradition ? 
go continue examination , water , 
enough start . 
theme : `` find commandment scripture 
exercise inference ; inference inform assumption , 
, cultural bias . '' 
, far , identify 
`` commandment '' generally accept christian -- yet 
, already , difficulty start surface . 

difficulty want discuss next essay topic . 
divorce 
commandment already strike difficulty : see almost 
evidence people eager find commandment condemn 
, spend time write nasty screed 
horror viciousness divorce , demand 
us law refuse allow , refuse `` unrepentant divorcee '' place 
church . 
say divorce enter 
consideration general -- definitely matter concern , 
even `` liberal '' church circle . 
example , wildly liberal 
episcopalian priest , wildly liberal diocese , 
recommend couple approach marry 
`` private '' secular ceremony judge , `` public '' ceremony 
celebrate need go agonizing `` examination '' official 
would soon take role interpret command 
face christian . 
, church effectively 
create famous divorce !
