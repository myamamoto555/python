apparently think sort one-man judge jury 
declare `` total '' victory sit back enjoy 
applause . 
pick wrong topic think 
rig `` quotation '' sustain legend lie deir 
yassin `` massacre . '' 
lot learn come historical methodology . 
basic level , know big 
difference weigh evidence fairly merely finding 
`` quotation '' support preset opinion . 
study history israel must know 
many source `` quotation '' axe grind , 
therefore must careful `` quote . '' 

example , meir , cite , indeed general , scholar , 
war hero . 
mean everything come 
mouth gold . 
fact lack experience 
show , fanatic , embittered leftist much 
anti-israel blathering forget blather would 
consider something like treason context . 

course consider find juicy 
`` quotation '' use attack israel . 
benny morris hashomer hatzair represent `` scholar '' 
rehash old attack irgun . 
fool . 
old zionist ideological catfight , surface 
attack - likud government . 
look closely 
section deir yassin book war independence , 
see `` indictment '' pure hot air . 

best decade digging sort damn 
evidence . 
unfortunately , book parade 
`` scholarly , '' force put footnote . 
clearly see 
deir yassin account base nothing . 
deir yassin `` massacre '' never take place propagandist 
tell , sabra shatila `` massacre . '' 
get 
feeling people like blame jews `` massacre , '' even 
make ? 
must sound spicy . 
even jews 
like , reason . 
please , confuse deir yassin `` massacre '' stuff 
fact scholarship . 
stick begin 's version 
unless find something serious contradict .
