vlbi project meet international space agency 
ed 
member jpl 's space long baseline interferometry 
project team recently conclude week-long series 
meeting official russia japan . 
meeting part `` space vlbi week '' hold jpl 
early march intend maintain cooperation 
international space agency participate development 
u.s. space vlbi project , recently approve jpl flight 
project set launch 1995 . 
u.s. space vlbi utilize two earth-orbiting spacecraft 
-- japanese vsop vlbi space observe program satellite 
8-meter radio telescope , russian 
10-meter satellite . 
spacecraft team 
ground-based radio telescope located around world create 
radio telescope network astronomer hope expand radio 
telescope observe power factor 10 . 
japan 's vsop satellite use limited six-hour orbit 
conduct imaging science , russian spacecraft 
exploit larger , 28-hour earth orbit conduct exploratory 
radio astronomy . 
satellite point source target 
roughly 24 hour , approximately 20 ground-based radio 
telescope simultaneously point source object 
within view earth . 
accord dr. joel smith , jpl 's project manager 
u.s. space vlbi , meeting like hold jpl permit 
japan russia , little previous experience radio 
interferometry , establish work relationship radio 
astronomy community vital complex 
observation require space project . 
`` one main activity develop methodology 
international coordination , two spacecraft 
simultaneously rely corresponding tracking station 
use ground-based radio telescope observe 
celestial object , '' say smith . 
three new tracking antenna build dsn 
facility three track facility locate 
japan , russia green bank , w.va . 
global network 
ground-based radio telescope use precision clock 
high-speed recorder collect observation datum forward 
information correlator located national radio 
astronomy observatory socorro , n.m. . 
correlator 
combine process datum , make available mission 
investigator moscow , tokyo , jpl via electronic mail . 
smith optimistic massive radio telescope create 
space network provide radio astronomer 
better resolution ever achieve 
ground-based radio telescope , allow astronomer take 
closer look distant object space . 
`` long history radio astronomy use 
ground-based telescope , '' say smith . 
`` intend 
extend radio astronomy earth orbit . 
goal look 
deeper core galactic nucleus , quasar 
active radio source understand drive thing 
see far radio astronomy . '' 
smith note one examine `` active galactic 
nucleus , 'll find jet appear spew speed greater 
light , energy level million time greater 
would expect . '' 
say astronomer believe black hole may 
located core galaxy , may fuel 
jet . 
smith hope `` use space look 
core , theory may support disprove . '' 
russian hardware , include transponder 
transmitter , test united states , 
japanese hardware schedule arrive testing later 
year . 
analysis hardware permit u.s. scientist 
engineer understand modify high-speed 
correlator operating nrao order accommodate odd 
datum pattern originate 20 
ground-based radio telescope involve space . 
smith particularly pleased meeting 
japanese russian space agency official -- like hold 
jpl march -- proceed smoothly . 
yet know 
political uncertainty russia could jeopardize country 's 
participation project . 
`` nothing ever smooth , '' say , `` russians 
incredibly open . 
always anticipate 
likelihood succeed political factor 
beyond control , yet tend way keep 
thing go , scientist side try hard , 
people recognize value cooperation level . '' 
smith point japanese space agency 
stake fulfil international commitment 
science mission . 
`` japanese extremely cooperative , since 
international cooperation essential science mission , '' 
say . 
smith also note japanese space agency official 
look u.s. space mission opportunity showcase 
technology involve vsop spacecraft , highly 
regard mach v launch vehicle . 
yet regardless risk involve undertake 
ambitious project , jpl 's smith satisfied plan 
space vlbi project beyond significant financial 
political hurdle otherwise might threaten project . 
`` fortunately , virtue two partner , 
either fall , would still something 
. 
, spacecraft independent , 
scientifically exciting mission . ''
