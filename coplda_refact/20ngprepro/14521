important christianity damage . 

people `` speak tongue '' make claim 
miraculously speak foreign language power 
holy spirit , easily show simply 
make noise , damage christian , since many 
christian distinguish various sect . 
modest claim `` tongue '' simply 
uncontrolled praise `` word fail '' surely one 
use make use practice . 
agree point `` charismatic '' practice like 
lead form worship 
worshipper show genuine praise god ; one 
thing jesus warn .
