god unknowable , comment motive , would 
distressing allow misunderstand fault 
. 
sanity 's sake must assume , believe , 
message come somehow . 
question whether come 
immediately every individual , contain complex 
canon must interpret expert consultation one another , 
transmit directly appoint representative free 
interpret , extend modify canon . 
god 's message indeed 
mediate , problem arise whether individual - 
stand mediated message fully clearly . 
since responsibility 
understand lie ultimately individual , must assume 
god benevolence guide individual appropriate source 
individual , whereof person may may drink . 
metaphysically , multiple moral code 
absolute moral code , think theologically questionable .

example complicate age thin line morality 
politeness . 
might say `` burp '' , burp swearing carry 
stigma today . 
talk `` take lord 's 
name vain '' serious transgression , example case 
hypocrisy vary moral code . 
absolute moral code , proposition law code apply 
absolutely universally , definition . 
conceivably moral code 
could subset universal code , say outset . 
, 
example , god 's code could include , `` thou shalt create without 
hospitable planet live '' , law would inapplicable . 
nevertheless , would entitle suppose law applicable 
also applicable god . 
begin ask law might appear god 's moral code , 
sense absurdity question . 
god make law 
follow ? 
perhaps god sort category `` morality '' 
sensibly apply .
