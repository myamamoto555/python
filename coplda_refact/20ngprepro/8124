computing science ' course real newcastle university . 
conversion course , least teach real programming . 
space 9 month teach pascal , simula , prolog , miranda . 
also , basic low level stuff 68000 cover well . 
also concurrent programming operating system , software 
engineering , plus quite optional unit , include database theory , 
stuff comm . 
pascal replace + + think next year - lear 
x windows programming well 
anyway via good selection project final three month - depend 
taste , selection skill lear quite wide reach . 
one would level course , would think 
invaluable , lack option project period industry - 
would probably need slightly longer project period say six month , 
would enhance prestige usefulness already excellent thorough 
course . 
yes , know sound like plug course , !
