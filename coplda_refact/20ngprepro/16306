theory make sense s1 s2 
either chip , vary among 
possibility , anyone try break encryption 
brute force need plow possible serial 
number 2 ^ 30 , one billion , multiply number 
different s1 , s2 combination . 
suppose instead s1 s2 reconstruct give 3 4 
unit key generate single batch sort know 
plaintext attack , say . 
suppose 3 4 chip 
program session never find way commercial 
product , instead end `` elsewhere '' . 
suppose folk `` elsewhere '' determine unit key , give 
physical access one chip . 
folk 
determine s1 s2 whole batch ... 
many supposition ? 
yeah , probably .
