point 1 : 
begin see part disagreement whole 
`` yeast issue '' differ perception differ meaning 
word . 
medical doctor specific specialize `` jargon '' , 
necessary precise communication within field fully 
cognizant since , , speak `` '' peer . 

situation , many time word phrase use doctor 
different specific meaning word use 
world large , cause significant miscommunication . 
one example word , 
relevant yeast discussion , exact meaning `` systemic '' . 
obvious meaning word specific , much 
meaning . 
also observation 
newsgroup doctor come together essentially 
equal term , , combine jargon issue , fan 
flame . 
probably first time practice doctor get 
really `` beat '' view medicine , 
otherwise see much practice except occasional 
`` difficult '' patient . 
point 2 : 
understand viewpoint among many practice doctor 
prescribe patient unless treatment 
show effective risk understand well-constructed 
clinical trial usually double-blind , 
part approve fund clinical trial . 
doctor , 
differently would , belief system , unethical practice . 

follow therapy `` accept '' list therefore non - 
therapy - even exist , underlie hypothesis 
theory validity , even sound plausible extrapolation 
currently know . 
anecdotal evidence value , either , 
treatment point-of-view . 
large , scientist , glad medical practice 
science take rigorous approach medical treatment . 
however , 
also human last check , one people 
significantly help currently unaccepted treatment , 
`` standard '' medicine able help , cause sit back 
wonder hold extreme rigid `` scientific '' viewpoint 
unethical humanitarian consideration . 
, underlie 
intent `` scientific '' approach medicine protect health 
patient provide best possible care patient , 
patient come first consider treatment . 
need slightly modify approach treatment satisfy 
`` scientific '' `` humanitarian '' viewpoint . 
earlier post 
outline crazy idea . 
gist give 
physician freedom encouragement medical community prescribe 
alternate , yet prove therapy maybe support anecdotal evidence 
patient avenue accept therapy exhaust 
. 
patient would fully inform 
support proper clinical trial 
real potential risk real possibility benefit derive 
. 
approach satisfy need scientific rigor . 
also satisfy 
humanitarian need patient . 
reality many patient 
reach dead-end treatment symptom use accept 
medicine go outside orthodox medical community : either 
doctor brave enough prescribe treatment risk lose 
license , worse , proper medical 
training . 
approach also recognize reality keep control 
within orthodox medicine , benefit information glean 
could help focus limited resource towards future clinical trial 
productive way . 
everybody win admittedly rose-colored approach - 
sure real problem approach well - present 
stimulate discussion . 
hopefully write may give doctor better idea 
`` open '' alternative therapy , well real 
difficulty read `` apparent hostility '' `` coldness '' 99.9 % pure 
`` scientific '' approach medicine . 
believe best approach medical 
treatment one `` humanitarian '' aspect balance 
`` scientific '' aspect . 
anything else good medicine , . 
` nf ' leaning , guess .
