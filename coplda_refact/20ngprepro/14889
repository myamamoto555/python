way calculate new top speed assume car rev limit top speed mileage benefit identical car cd reduce .34 .33 .

remember 's hand awhile since 
take aerodynamics use stuff since . 
cd relate drag force effect top speed 
fuel consumption . 
drag force car aircraft greater 
vehicle 's engine overcome reach top speed . 
auto course also overcome rolling resistance 
since drag oppose vehicle 's motion , engine must make 
burn fuel . 
anyway , since auto rather 
complex , drag , pressure , etc either find , 
use numerical method . 
anyway flow around cylinder drag : 
cd d q 2r 
d drag force , q flow velocity r radius 
. 
get rough rough estimate , set r car 's 
width , q car 's speed know cd , find drag force 
car would need overcome .
