think general interest . 
copy something write another list . 
may 
find relevant . 
ask : 
> make common-law marriage wrong ? 
common-law marriage necessarily wrong . 

nothing bible old new testament get marry 
preacher , priest jewish christian . 
fact jewish 
priest never connection wedding . 
common notion marriage perform 
clergyman . 
fact , traditional christian view least 
west bride groom minister marriage , 
clergyman witness . 
however ! 
essential ingredient marriage mutual commitment . 
two 
person consider marry bind 
mutual promise live together husband wife , 
forsake , till death part . 
reason reason concern 
marry always insist kind public 
ceremony order society , couple , may 
clear whether commitment make . 
suppose away public ceremony , standard vow , 
etc. . 
instead , man woman settle live 
together . 
year , man say woman : hey , honey , 
great last , think time move . 
say : talk ? 
say : leave look someone prettier 
younger . 
say : . 
marry ! 
say : talk ? 
never get marry . 
say : remember distinctly say night 
first make love . 
say : `` love deep 
ocean , eternal star . 
long live , , 
utterly completely . 
lie , last feeble 
breath utter name . 
... '' 
say : oh ! 
rhetoric . 
poetry . 

man romantic mood , bind say kind silly 
thing like . 
must take literally . 
insistence formal ceremony 
matter public record . 
church insist , duty among 
thing give moral advice , give man moral advice 
relation woman idea marry 
, anybody , vice versa . 
state insist , since state concern 
property rights , child care support , therefore need 
know make commitment . 
prospective father-in-law insist , 
want daughter seduce abandon . 
prospective spouse insist , want make 
sure know whether hear real commitment , 
`` poetry . '' 
person make vow insist make 
formally publicly , order may clear 
mind , may know 
rhetoric . 
real thing . 
hence insistence formal public explicit avowal 
marriage commitment . 
church go insist , 
christian marry , clergyman shall present wedding 
record vow behalf church , 
impossible valid wedding without clergyman , order 
make sure couple understand christian teaching 
marriage , fact promise marry 
christian sense . 
church also prefer standard marriage 
vow , wary let couple write vow , much 
reason lawyer prefer standard terminology 
draw contract . 
certain language repeatedly 
use , one sure court interpret . 
try say thing word , may find 
probate judge 's interpretation 
intend . 
similarly , church prefer avoid endless debate 
whether `` main squeeze '' `` long 
haul '' fact cover territory `` forsake '' 
`` till death part . '' 
topic come list . 
topic 
? 
one ask , `` couple love 
live together , marriage eye 
god ? '' 
eventually someone ask , `` case , status 
break ? 
moral equivalent get divorce ? 
relationship god forbid either walk 
? '' 
original questioner say : `` good grief , never think 
! '' 
fact , reasonable grounds suspect 
someone say , `` need piece paper ceremony 
front judge preacher order show love 
, '' try way -- advantage 
marriage plus option change mind minimum 
bother . 
point someone may say , `` none apply 
mate . 
quite clear fact assume lifelong 
commitment , ` better worse , forsake , till death 
part . ' 
case , ceremony need . '' 
reply would : reason require driver 's 
license keep dangerous driver road . 
wrong 
existence unlicensed driver , existence 
dangerous driver . 
however , testing licensing driver 
obvious reasonable means pursue goal reduce 
number dangerous driver road . 
therefore state rightly 
make enforce law , citizen positive 
moral obligation refrain drive without license matter 
much hotshot behind wheel think . 
back original question . 
know 
couple live together around 20 year . 
ask : 
point stop fornicate start marry ? 

answer : point , , definitely 
explicitly accept obligation faithful , 
better worse , long live . 
accept 
obligation , reason willing 
declare front , say , justice peace ?
