27 `` series , circa 1987 . 
damn thing use 
make noise like . 
2 separate problem ... one 
flyback , assembly winding yoke 
come together . 
first : find poke around winding assembly , 
thing would make noise . 
guess enough potential 
assembly leak , spray dielectric insulation 
spray -- think urethane . 
fix . 
second : flyback ... life , isolate one . 

leave cover , tv quiet . 
put cover back , 
let heat , 'll start whine -- kinda hard solve 
cover !! 
: - 
friend mine use fix tv 's say might 
leak somewhere flyback . 
usually surround bunch 
black . 
hope start ... find something , let know !
