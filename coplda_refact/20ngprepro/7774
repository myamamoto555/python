okay , let get record straight livermore gas gun . 
project manager dr. john hunter , work 
laser group livermore . 
, may ask , gas gun 
laser ? 
nothing , really , gun physically 
located across road free electron laser building , 
fel building heavily shield control room thick wall 
gun firing control . 
suspect 
office work administrative convenience . 
visit hunter beginning feb. tour gun . 
time work gas gun r&d boeing , work , 
thing help save space station , 
gun use mixture , burn chamber 
200 ft long 16 inch id i.e. look like pipe . 
chamber hold 1 ton piston propel several 
hundred chamber . 
side piston 
gas , initially room temperature ten 
atmosphere . 
piston compress heat hydrogen ahead 
stainless steel burst diaphragm rupture , around 50,000 psus . 
barrel gun 100 foot long 4 inch 
bear . 
mount right angle chamber i.e. 
intersect . 
future , barrel 
could raise gun fire air without 
move larger heavier chamber . 
projectile use 
testing 5 kg cylinder lexan plastic , 4 diameter 
50 cm long . 
acceleration come expansion hydrogen 
gas 50,000 psus downwards projectile leave 
barrel . 
barrel evacuate , end seal 
sheet plastic film little thicker saran wrap . 

plastic blow small amount residual air trap 
barrel ahead projectile . 
gun fire bunker fill sandbag plastic 
water jug . 
early testing fragment plastic 
projectile find . 
higher speed later testing , 
projectile vaporize . 
testing bunker livermore test range 
3 mile across , projectile would go 100-200 km 
fire maximum range . 
intent move whole gun 
vandenberg afb testing complete , 
fire pacific ocean , use tracking radar 
follow projectile . 
design goal gun throw 5 kg projectile 4 
half orbital speed . 
far reach 2 , 
gun currently repair , last test 
blow seal damage hardware think 
detonate burning , 
chance talk hunter directly . 
people wait test scramjet component 
gun firing gun air mach 12 
4 , since get wind tunnel mach 8 . 
gun cost 4 million develop , basically 
proof-of-concept bigger gun capable firing useful - 
size payload space . 
would require order 
100 kg projectile , deliver order 20 kg 
useful payload orbit .
