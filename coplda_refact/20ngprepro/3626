yep , pretty much . 
jew understand 
jewish way thinking . 
however , jews believe covenant 
yhwh patriarch abraham moses , case establish moral 
code follow mankind . 
even jews could decide boundary 
fall , though . 
understand , sadducees believe torah 
require , whereas pharisees ancestor modern judaism believe 
torah available interpretation lead understanding 
require morality nuance - > talmud . 
essence biblical morality interface 
man yhwh jew christian necessarily indicate 
anything yhwh outside relationship although one speculate .

trouble really know `` create 
image '' mean . 
hear number different opinion 
still come conclusion . 
rather upset apple cart 
one want base life script shaky foundation mix metaphor 
unashamedly ! 
live christ 's example , know little 
jesus person . 
recorded utterance set narrative 
follower , small reference historian . 
revelation aside , one `` know '' christ second-hand worse . 
attempt debunk christianity although may seem way 
initially , point ` m try make really bible 
interpret , interpretation humanity . 
guess 
faith come inherent .

. 
may absolute moral code . 
undoubtably multiple 
moral code . 
multiple moral code may found absolute moral 
code . 
example , parent may tell child never swear , child 
may assume parent never swear simply parent tell 
child `` wrong '' . 
, parent may swear like trooper 
pub bar child . 
`` wrongness '' 
child disobey parent . 
parent may feel `` inappropriate '' 
swear front child may quite happy swear front 
animal . 
analogy quite hold water child know 
type parent may parent later life 
get gist ? 
incidentally , young child consider directive 
absolute get older see piaget learn morality .
