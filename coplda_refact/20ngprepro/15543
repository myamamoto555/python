good question . 
major blind spot understanding 
make earth habitable . 
example , earth 's 
atmosphere concentration oxygen ? 
naive 
answer `` photosynthesis '' , clearly incomplete . 
photosynthesis 
make atmosphere oxygenate , oxygen produce 
consume plant decay eat . 
need 
photosynthesis plus mechanism sequester fraction 
result reduce material . 
earth , mechanism burial seafloor sediment organic 
matter , mostly oceanic source . 
however , burial require 
continental sediment deep ocean , burial rate slow 
material consume sequester . 
suggest planet without large ocean , planet without 
continent undergo weather , hard time accumulate 
oxygen atmosphere . 
particular , planet may 
hard time support oxygen atmosphere . 
also problem oxygen earth 's atmosphere 
relatively stable geological time , period least 
2 order magnitude longer decay time atmospheric o2 
weather absence replenishment . 
convincing feedback 
mechanism identify . 
perhaps reason weak 
anthropic principle : last 500 myr , oxygen 
level drop low , would wonder 
.
