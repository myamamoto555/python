actually think conflict really understand 
passage say . 
first , faith ? 
study 
meaning greek hebrew word translate think 
come conclusion word mean lot mere 
belief . 
faith mean trust action . 
put 
belief action simply qualify faith . 
think 
james mean say `` faith without work dead '' 
, `` show faith work . '' 
remember james 
write `` twelve tribe scatter abroad . '' 

probably mean write would hear gospel much 
later would understand meaning original greek . 
indeed suspect james write , today , among 
intend reach . 
paul , hand write mostly 
people roman empire generally understand meaning 
greek . 
another key conflict look paul 's 
statement context . 
think find paul 
contrast faith work context compare 
gospel law , mean law moses . 
great 
burden paul 's life . 
apostle gentiles would go 
convert bunch people , `` '' would come along 
try convince also obey law mose cf 
act chapter 15 . 
context paul condemn idea 
save work law , say save blood 
jesus faith . 
believe better translation 
today would save faithfulness . 
think 
`` faithfulness '' today meaning closer original 
writer intend . 
> someone fully believe life totally lead 
> god , accord romans person still save faith . 
think misunderstand romans . 
paul really say 
god prefer faithful gentile `` keep kosher '' 
kosher jew fail stay faithful important matter 
follow lord charity toward fellow . 
> bit say god someone cold 
> i.e. know - condemn lukewarm christian someone 
> know believe god make attempt live bible . 
sense faith describe , real faith 
lukewarm . 
know god lukewarm unfaithful , 
worse person never hear . 
remember , jesus 
parable pearl great price mat 13:45 -46 
one treasure hide field mat 13:44 indicate 
price kingdom god . 
agree general , include fact `` pistis '' 
force `` faithful '' . 
however take far , 
end something paul definitely would 
intend . 
faithful means follow god thing . 
say 
save faithful close say 
save commit sin . 
assume mean . 
almost give find specific verbal 
completely capture . 
however think paul describe would 
call basic orientation , include aspect trust 
commitment . 
jesus speak rebirth , imply basic 
change . 
may still thing sinful , may fail show 
new life christ many situation . 

christian better basic change orientation 
jesus call bear .
