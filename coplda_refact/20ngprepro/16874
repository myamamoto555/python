rom 1 really idolatry . 
refer homosexuality 
> pass . 
everything sinful specifically elaborate new testament ? 
scripture condemn drug dealer . 
rule 
spirit rather letter free legalism , also 
protect sin spirit . 
word 
two edge sword cut way . 
think must careful totally throw leviticus . 
law reflection god 's character true holy nature , 
say god endorse homosexuality run problem . 
homosexuality `` natural '' whatever mean wholesome , 
endorse god , oppose sexual behavior narrow-minded 
, would believe , condemnation 
leviticus . 
condemnation midst 
sex sin condemnation , nothing text say 
law limit temple prostitution , good reason believe 
case . 
furthermore , male homosexual sex 
crime ! 
every sin elaborate new testament ? 
take look 
corinthians 5 . 
paul say one corinthians break 
law even hear among gentiles , one father 's 
wife . 
prohibition father 's wife 
leviticus . 
new testament verse clearly condemn besides 
one . 
notice paul say sin commit 
adultery , etc. - speak one 's father 's wife . 
notice also sexual condemnation leviticus mention 
specific context paganism either . 
pagan 
mention corinthian either . 
matter fact 
take one 's father 's wife even among gentiles . 

plain sin , whether worship idol involve

one reason accept common argument 
paul probably face problem . 
sin 
tough come , especially without supernatural power . 

homosexual sin difficult overcome heterosexual sin , 
like lust married woman , sleep around people 
opposite sex ? 
doubt , even , excuse . 
god greater . 
another reason reject ignore supernatural 
power god intervene kind situation . 
many 
people set free sin power god ? 
sure 
may group try change homosexual fail . 
reflection people involve program , 
god 's willingness ability change sinner . 
program 
use formula may fail . 
people need power god 
change , whether involve homosexual sin , 
sin .

> personal qualm . 
see come conclusion . 
paul 's dealings 
issue encourage people give liberty order 
spare - allow people continue sin 
difficult . 
take example eat meat offer idol . 
paul feel nothing wrong , abstract sense , 
eat meat . 
yet advise believer sacrifice liberty 
eat meat order spare . 
paul never allow people sin live holy 
tough . 
paul write `` make provision flesh fulfill lust 
thereof . '' 
romans 13:14 go discourse 
sacrifice liberty order spare conscience . 
suppose sin people practice homosexual act . 
since consider sin , use paul 's approach 
issue , would otherwise homosexual 
sacrifice liberty marry 
member opposite sex . 
paul never offer lesser sin homosexual 
`` marriage '' prevent people engage may consider 
damaging sin . 
> another example , paul obviously 
> would prefer see people least circumstance 
> remain unmarried . 
yet unable , certainly 
> would rather see married state might 
> tempt fornication . 
yet marriage sin . 
marriage holy - something 
god ordain , paul recognize . 
> note 
> creation story work enter human life result sin . 

> mean christian stop work save . 
actually , adam put garden tend fall . 
fall would toil ground . 
> danger try cure attempt often 
> fail , , end damage range 
> psychological damage suicide , well broken marriage 
> attempt live heterosexual fail . 
dependent totally god - glorious 
position . 
must transform renew 
mind - way homosexual walk freedom , 
like anyone else . 
> well imagine paul 
> prefer see people long-term , committed christian 
> relationship promiscuity . 
work -- genesis 
> suggest part god 's original ideal either -- think 
> relationship still vehicle people share god 's love 
> . 
sure see people oppose view see 
conclusion . 
like say , `` kill , gun 
? 
person overcome desire 
sleep goat ? 
would better sleep one goat , 
? 
person want sleep aunt ? 
would better sleep one aunt ? 
case , people animal one sleep , higher 
chance get disease . 
deal 
physical aspect question . 
whichever sin commit , 
lead spiritual death . 
> cent . 
action . 
christian homosexual say 
> relationship different greek homosexuality paul 
> would familiar , exactly kind 
> argument make judicial oath tax collector . 
issue often address scripture seem 
actual act . 
second , historical snobbery say 
homosexual century capable `` loving 
relationship ? '' 
ancient writings glorify homosexual `` love . '' 
btw , one believe refrain make . 
also , 
get tax collector sinner . 
certainly 
explicit . 
jesus tell quit job . 
link hudson . 
reluctant comment detail . 
basic concept 
intention jesus paul greatly different . 
indicate 
article , whatever ambiguity various word still 
think significant , seem clear paul consider 
homosexuality see around wrong . 
fact 
depend upon basic approach bible . 
afraid 
communication legalist christian even 
harder protestants catholics 16th cent . 
since 
disagree start point , obviously go 
disagree intermediate discussion conclusion . 
sometimes discussion still useful . 
see interesting 
work paul jews . 
obviously agree , 
sometimes helpful insight mean . 

see much sign hope . 
axiom 
time hitler 's name invoke , hope sensible 
discussion go . 
subject , sleep goat 
invoke , think enough basis understand 
worth pursue .
