okay , go blindly believe thing without reasonable 
evidence ? 
realize theist .

unsupported claim , even claim 
news agency accept .

stick sheer impossible , instead merely difficult , 
fine . 
statement fact classify ,

person reveal , go jail . 
never say could prove satisfaction , merely 
say difficult .

people argue unless course , need 
handicap .
