: wonder many atheist care speculate face 
: world atheist majority rather minority group 
: population . 
think every since cut tie 
christianity . 
surprising note large majority 
people , least finland , seem - even though 
90 % population member lutheran church finland , 
religious people actually minority . 
could possible many people believe god `` case '' ? 
seem people want seek truth ; fall prey pascal 's 
wager poor argument . 
small minority believe 
read bible regularly . 
majority care - believe , 
know . 
people usually allow belief change lifestyle , 
want keep virtual gate open . 
christian would say 
`` bear spirit '' , disturb . 
religion something think . 
afraid society true atheist majority impossible 
dream . 
religion strong appeal people , nevertheless - 
promise life death something human eagerly listen . 
couple threat eternal torture idea 
morality constant scrutiny cosmic cop , many 
people take poison smile . 
pretend swallow 
unconsciously hope god would notice 
: also , many atheist would actually take stance accor 
: higher value way think theistic way thinking . 

: typical selfish argument would line think evolve 
: inherent motivation , one , intrinsically , different 
: , qualitatively . 
measure stick must draw 
: somewhere , assign value system belief core , 
: alternative apply periphery ; ie , 
: express selfishness . 
logic reason value , would claim atheistic thinking 
higher value theistic exposition . 
theist make unnecessary 
assumption believe - yet see good reason believe 
god , take leap faith . 
revelation would . 
however , value logic reasoning ? 
question bear 
resemblance problem science : mathematics 
work ? 
strong deep structuralist , like atkins , propose 
perhaps , , everything _ _ mathematics . 
usefulness criterion ?
