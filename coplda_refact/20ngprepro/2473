well , yeah , tell national defense medical centre outside ottawa . 
theoretically limit service personnel , study hear 
suggest half patient civilian 
connection `` urgent '' . 
problem , system hospital ' annual budget approve 
government , keep political consideration medical decision ? 
bet mp mpp , good friend one , put 
hospital 's `` urgent '' care list matter minor problem . 
ok 
unless someone get bump list bigshot . 
would national health insurance mean americans 
fully insure might settle less ? 

canada , provincial insurance cover health cost except dental 
care , eyeglass , prescription drug , ambulance service , private 
hospital room , -- many canadians end buy private 
insurance . 
policy cover thing run # 40 $ 40 
month . 
hmm . 
much difference would make figure percentage gnp spend 
health care dentistry optometry include accounting ? 
maybe canada spend proportionately much health care .

second least popular man ontario , warn year ago 
stop cross-border shopping huge number , `` service 
expect province year '' fortunately 
less fortunately retailer western new york 
canadian dollar go back realistic value .

would happen warning turn 
truth ? 
would private insurer take slack ? 
would 
obligation . 
course , could eventually make money , 
say true , would loathe practice handle 
basic service , .

would free care encourage people run doctor every 
ache pain ? 

people get free treatment go doctor hospital 
third often pay share medical 
bill . 

still , canadians -- pay nothing doctor 's -- lower 
health bill .

would free . 
americans would start another revolution 
pay tax canadian rate . 
private health insurance industry big 
powerful kill ? 

dismantle health segment insurance industry would 
`` politically thorny , '' quiet word one advocate 
national plan . 
1,200 firm sell $ 192 billion 
health insurance . 
would put hard fight . 
industry 
grow eightfold since canada shut health insurer , 
government leave politician open lobbyist 
canada 's parliamentary system .

, doubt americans would like give insurance company much 
power . 
half wonder canadian health insurer go along 
province federal government year ago know 
good chance public system go bust long run , 
afterwards could clean okay , sort contradict say 
higher . 
another possibility . 
would add bonus 
argue government involvement could 
point failure instead cite theoretical principle .
