follow precedent area , government likely put tax 
encryption technology .

fbi toss grenade house . 
batf appear logical 
agency enforce regulation : federal control , tobacco , 
firearm base tax . 
look fcc : allow sale receive

nothing 
desire prevent harmful interference . 
government make radio 
receiver illegal make think claim right control
