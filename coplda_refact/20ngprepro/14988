silly . 
use sound manager quadra well , use sm 
low-end machine simply work decent action 
game since steal much time cpu . 

fact . 
write directly hardware se , 
possible 4 simultaneous channel sample sound 
cost approx . 
8000 cycle . 
exactly would use 
sm , pray tell ? 
correct thing use sm machine 
carry extra load use sm mean , write directly 
sound hardware machine . 

politically correct thing , developer ' point 
view .
