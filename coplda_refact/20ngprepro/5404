mistake understanding ? 
yes , degree . 
excellent discussion 
nature scientific work two week ago , hope 
escape notice . 
correct word ` likely ' . 
way sure model 
theory absolutely correct . 
theory back evidence , 
prove - theory ` true ' mathematical sense . 
however , theory mere description rationalisation 
phenomenon . 
extremely important test whether theory 
_ predict _ something new yet observe . 
successful theory 
science come pass test , include big 
bang theory cosmic evolution , theory natural selection etc. . 
mean _ must _ correct , mere 
` best fit ' datum .

well , yes , want _ believe _ . 
science 
require - take good look theory evidence , see 
theory make successful prediction , use reason . 
disbeliever punish .

> conclusive evidence , leave faith . 
puzzle - need faith _ anything _ ? 
fellow atheist would call weak atheist - someone 
unable believe , ie , fail entertain belief god . 
yes , know one believe without god 's help ; luther make 
quite clear letter erasmus . 
afraid 
change situation .

, , although look like one . 
true dichotomy , 
either something exist , nothing exist . 
nothing exist , nobody 
would ask . 
something exist , possible ask , 
actually exist could give answer . 
imagine , moment , nobody non-existence could also 
ask : `` nothing exist ? '' 
equivalent , 
`` nothing exist nothingness '' . 
, `` anything exist '' equivalent `` something exist 
'' .

indeed think probably _ _ reason , existence , 
general , reason state . 
however , still 
leave open question `` , '' , 
theistic explanation come . 
science give reason _ particular _ human 's existence . 
> come . 
either `` , therefore . '' 
, `` reason . '' 
deep philosophical question - determinism true , ? 
also , god deterministic ? 
tend think question 
meaning case . 
reason , yet fail see would . 
perspective , look like ` ' exist truly random 
reason . 
roll two dice - get 6 1 ? 

believe better reason existence ?

yes , satisfy reason , find something better . 
15 year christianity help respect ,

impossible know unknowable thing . 
however , question 
`` exist , particular '' _ _ invalid question - 
say . 
perspective , impossible 
tell , believe give explanation instead 
another , especially since find delude . 
> apology . 
use `` come '' .

become spacetime . 
think `` pre-existence '' oxymoron . 
time ` outside ' 
spacetime except universe , 
perspective , universe never . 
exist 
inside .

. 
validity question discuss separately ; think 
philosophy great help . 
know , 
knowable ?

good question . 
try answer , numerous 
question bother , finally find nothing base 
faith . 
think would honest ask , `` believe '' 
`` believe '' .
