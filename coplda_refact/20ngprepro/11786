perhaps hacker become ick professional ? 
notice 
associate progression hacker computer professional . 
rather distasteful . 
occur series thing happen : 
1 one 's ego outgrow one 's 
2 one 's financial situation take precedence 
3 change priority esp . 
family possibly lead 2 
4 hacker 's attitude make shift `` fun '' `` work '' 
5 one 's vocation burn away creativity need `` hobby '' 
biggest killer imo 
6 one 's dream sadly shatter hard rock society 's 
version reality . 
without dream motivation die , without 
motivation effort seem useless . 
another set problem stem child . 
remember 
several completely different computer system , child 
grow choice enjoy 
diversity . 
remember great computer fallout early 
eighty vividly force stop use skill develop system 
dead . 
diversity system allow widely 
divergent paradigm . 
period force hacker continually learn new 
system attempt keep . 
mention program 
need force situation write 
commercial offering available . 
child 
teach `` user '' mentality . 
number `` old-timer '' dwindle 
replace next generation .
