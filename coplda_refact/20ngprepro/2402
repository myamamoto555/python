boorishly reply , find information 
already . 
spec use term loosely follow : 
: 16 bit converter , 14 bit accuracy 100 khz , 12 bit accuracy 
200 khz . 
spec , monotonicity , linearity . 
8 multiplexed 
input share single , input sample 
time , conversion spec sample rate 
must use . 
thus , two channel , 14 unknown quality bit 
50 khz per channel . 
poorer quality national 
instruments , sample rate . 
: 16 bit converter . 
spec , monotonicity , linearity . 

4 output channel converter . 
price external converter box , nubus interface 
board , plus c driver software igor 's $ 2695 . 
rather 
steep .
