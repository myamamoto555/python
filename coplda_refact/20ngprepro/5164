great , however leave one detail , always 
see nuclear plant , always fossil fuel plant . 

nuclear plant prefer run water close cycle , whereas 
fossil fuel plant case get away dump hot 
water . 
recall water hot thermodynamically many 
fossil fuel plant , course less danger radioactive 
contamination . 
actually reason see many cool tower fossil plant 
1 fossil unit multiple unit per plant generally smaller 
nuclear plant . 
300 mwe seem popular size many 
fossil plant build . 
average nuclear plant 1000 mwe . 
2 many 
fossil plant grandfather water discharge regulation 
adopt `` old dirt burner harm anything , let 'em go . '' 
. 
3 power draft cooling tower , low enough ground generally 
visible off-site , quite popular fossil plant . 
4 fossil 
plant use get much less regulatory attention nuclear .

actually condense environment essentially plant 
similar size . 
issue regardless 
heat come . 
condenser run high vacuum possible 
order reduce aerodynamic drag turbine . 
condenser pressure 
normally water 's vapor pressure condense temperature . 

desirable steam exhaust free water droplet 
moisture steam cause severe erosion damage turbine 
low pressure blade entrained water move high velocity 
cause erosion condenser tube . 
coldest thus lowest 
pressure condense environment always best . 
related issue pump condensate 
water end drip condenser tube . 
since 
condenser low pressure , force drive 
condensate pump gravity . 
condensate 
hot gravity head low , condensate 
steam bubble cause condensate pump . 

particularly destructive form cavitation avoid 
cost . 
pump located lowest point plant 
order provide gravity head pump . 
much lower 
must function hot water allow get 
. 
typically temperature run 100 120 
degree depend temperature river water term 
use describe river grade water even cooling tower 
system operate closed loop mode essentially river water 
pump . 
river water temperature high summer , 
operator typically allow level rise order 
provide gravity head . 
tradeoff involve since higher 
level encroach onto condense tube reduce 
condenser area . 
least east elsewhere moisture actually exist 
air , river water almost always cooler discharge 
water cooling tower . 
temperature discharge water 
cooling tower set ambient air temperature 
humidity . 
rare east hear actual river water 
temperature exceed 70 degree . 
vast difference typical 
`` 95-95 '' day 95 degree , 95 % humidity see routinely east . 
unusual , particularly successful 
clamp rigid discharge water temperature limit plant , 
plant reduce firing rate air temperature get 
high condenser handle heat load without excessive 
pressure .

true . 
actually secondary plant part make electricity 
feed feedwater boiler water chemistry bastard 
stepchild recently get respect deserve . 
plant chemist past decade fully understand 
cost impure water . 
`` impure '' , mean water 
dozen extra conductivity ppm dissolve 
oxygen . 
secondary water typically pure one 
find outside laboratory .
