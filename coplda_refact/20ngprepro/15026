convenient ? 
seem appropriate 
. 
assume favorable interpretation ' 1000 degree ' 
measurement temperature centigrade , rather 
common - us - fahrenheit , still labor 
least 2 misconception : 
1 . 
seem believe steel melt somewhere around 1000 c. 
actually , melting point iron alloy steel 
iron alloy neighborhood 1400 c. even gun 
find area achieve 1000 c temperature , steel 
part gun would deform , would still 
trivial identify nature weapon . 
2 . 
fire isothermal process . 
` hot ' spot 
` cold ' spot , though ` cold ' purely relative term . 

weapon necessarily situate hot spot , seem 
imply . 
, even , ? 
would melt 
anyway .
