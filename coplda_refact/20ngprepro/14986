well , almost . 
turn clever orbital mechanic 
engineer thing resonant interaction higher order 
harmonic earth 's gravitational field pump energy 
satellite , keep experience drag effect period 
month year . 
favorite example heavy elint 
satellite cosmos 1603 class , 14:1 resonance . 

particular , undergo two period prolonged gain 
altitude , current one start june 1991 ; mean altitude 
satellite high ever since launch 18 
march 1987 . 
look element also show 
limitation norad 's software -- another story . 
probably little relevance space station , since 71 
degree orbit satellite 850 km , 
unacceptably far inner van allen belt man platform . 

kind interesting point view physics 
situation . 
orbital element satellite available request .
