| incident ray strike object point p ... reflect 
| ray r transmitted ray calculate formula . 
| 
| call routine recursively r return color 
| along ray r . 
object 
| color light source 1 < < n . 
| 
| question : 
| combine , , 's get 
| correct result color return along ray ? 
first snide response , confuse 
issue , stumble lot thing well . 
suggest 
weakness reference material . 
get `` introduction ray 
trace '' andrew glassner good coverage 
algorithm . 
could also refer 2nd edition foley & van dam . 
question . 
simple answer keep add 
contribution clamp maximum intensity . 

example , intensity value range 0.0 1.0 , keep add 
clamp resultant value 1.0 might clamp lower 
bind 0.0 dark bulb , another issue ^ . 
, 
get illumination equation like : 
+ light n + + 
contribution due reflection sum light 
intensity , light due transparency . 
, slightly less 
illumination equation : 
+ light n + + 
, component illumination equation govern 
material constant ka , kd , kr kt . 
maximum get 
transparency give object , example , might 0.4 , 0.1 , 0.5 
glass object . 
hopefully answer question . 
'll forward `` illumination 
equation sermon '' also .
