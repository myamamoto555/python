problem ? 
possible individual see true prophetic vision , 
interpret scale time space accord material con - 
, translate perception plane 
time space immediate worldly context -- get 
wrong . 
rationally , rather unconsciously 
perception become clothe material image , instead remain 
realm potential . 
difficulty 
translate prophetic vision concrete always 
difficult , even prophet old . 
prophecy 
often subject multiple interpretation . 
likewise , apostles seem 
feel return lord `` soon '' sense 
perhaps generation . 
yet meaning `` soon '' prove 
different could grasp . 
prophetic vision tend telescope 
time , thing far appear close . 
another possibility vision one real event prepare 
happen , realm 
thwart force , include possibly act divine mercy . 
many concrete prophecy make day devout 
sincere sober christian . 
seem great come 
event really cast shadow arrival 
`` apocalyptic '' time . 
various prediction talk 
appear sincere sober hard accept , yet hard ignore com - 
. 
one feeling `` something start get ready 
begin commence happen '' . 
live , chinese say go , 
interesting time . 
discriminate , bible help much . 
old 
testament passage forget say know whether 
prophet true whether prophecy come pass . 

help eliminate failure fact , case earth - 
quake small comfort . 
seem prophecy give 
specific time place event suspect , 
necessarily false , sense state , vision 
subject mistranslation plane prophetic vision 
plane earthly time space . 
worth , rudolf steiner ask whether modern initiate 
could see future predict come event . 
answer 
would possible would withdraw active partus - 
, include proclaim see . 
fact 
spiritual law , answer question discriminate 
one make prophecy probably violate law , 
knowingly unknowingly , message consider 
priori dubious . 
i.e. would expect capable make 
true prediction give accurate expression would 
way prophet oregon earthquake . 
however , 
sympathize person publish prophecy . 
give 
overwhelming experience apparently , might feel impel , 
even commission god tell fellow human 
see . 
gerry palo 
church historian reader know whether 
prophecy past ? 
get 
impression .
