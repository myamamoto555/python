, word game . 
term god use different way usually . 
use different definition thing , 
commonly accept would say way define god ... 
exist , existence , say exist . 
interestingly , say `` existence exist '' one 
indubitable statement possible . 
, say god existence either waste time , existence 
already use need replace god , imply 
, case definition argument far 
incomplete , make fallacy .
