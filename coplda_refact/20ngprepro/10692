would appreciate thought make planet habitable human . 
make life similar atmosphere evolve give range 
physical aspect planet . 
question physical aspect 
simply disallow earth like condition . 

eg temperature range temp purely dependant dist 
sun sun temperature . 
. 
atmospheric presure ? 
- know nothing human tolerance 
people adapt high altitude andes 
tibet . 
suspect take several generation make 
adaptation europeans difficulty make adaptation . 

send woman lower altitude pregnant order 
insure sucessful childbirth . 
planetary mass ? 
- gravity surface important , much 
human body take day day . 
also mass effect 
atmosphere . 
think planet .3 3 time mass 
earth . 
suppose density important well . 

another factor consider x-ray opacity atmosphere 
case stellar flare , uv opacity also important uv 
radiation kill damage microbe , plant , animal . 
climate etc concern , axial tilt etc etc. . 

three factor relate one another .
