eschatology area christian agree . 
suspect 
primary source information prophet 
visionary , writings tend highly symbolic . 
however 
jesus ' teaching gospels book revelation 
john talk primarily difference eternal life 
eternal death . 
number occasion jesus say thing 
imply sort differentiation , e.g. lk 10:14 number 
similar passage jesus say thing like `` even xxx better 
judgement . '' 
also , cor 3 talk someone 
get heaven , skin tooth , . 

passage normally interpret suggest separate heaven , 
much differ level prestige punishment heaven 
hell christian would even go far . 

christian group know believe multiple heaven 
mormons , far mainstream christianity far 
enough many reader would call christian . 

idea area involve specific mormon revelation , addition 
bible `` holy tradition '' generic christian sort . 
note many christian cringe think 
associate grade god . 
whole point christ free 
result test could possibly pass . 

like test analogy , god grade strict unbending scale , 
also cheat -- replace test papers exam 
prepare teacher , actually grading . 
people end heaven hell , easy 
see would incline think grading . 

difference among branch christianity detail , think 
agree one way another , god cheat . 
personally sceptical anyone claim know exactly 
far god 's cheating extend . 
accept people 
explicitly acknowledge christ , somehow still follow 
heart ? 
many christian believe possible , least 
principle , certainly . 
jesus provide clear 
description save , clear 
provide exact description go place divide 
line . 
certainly make clear expect know whether 
individual save .
