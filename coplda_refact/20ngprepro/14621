'63 '82 vette basic chassis . 
1980 add aluminum weaker 
rear ` axle ' housing . 
year use brake , similar spring etc 
late 70 's bad year gm reliability . 
catastrophic converter 
add 1975 . 
cheapest corvette '78 '79 low end 4k top $ 12k except 
think '78 indy 25th vette

dad 66 vette say ` classic insurance ' . 
basically mean restrict amount drive 
time , basically mean cant use every day car would 
probably suit need limited mileage . 
inquire insurance agent : drive '69 
3000 mile less per year , must keep lock garage 
cost 2 % state value per year sound right ?

case , tell state farm value $ 20k . 
get appraiser look car . 
check serial number look 
equipe . 
depend mod car could 
worth 10k . 
problem like wrong engine trans . 
wrong paint type 
use lacquer modification would reduce tthe value . 

look car drive right ? 
sound like ball park price small-block 327 cu . 
manual 
air car . 
427 would put closer $ 30k . 
get appraise !!! 
insurance purpose also .
