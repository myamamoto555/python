regard love less `` benign '' christian .

misread . 
repeatedly complete bill 
accusation inquisition exhibit thorough form 
anyone might want demonstration harm human 
first place respect let alone love `` god '' 
near succession . 
please go back quote word : 
`` possibility always exist '' , revert proper 
time sequence , predecessor last several century could 
persuade `` christian b '' case inquisition indeed 
constitute egregious violation law love . 
must also note 
majority christian persuade . 
christian 
argumentation , well secular christian non-christian 
prohibition . 
mr. turpin allude trickier point : 
a. demonstrate human pain violation love involve 
inquisition . 
b. inquisitor respond mother church must , however 
painful seem , `` discipline '' child 
good -- case salvation soul 
tortured heretic recant , bad example 
`` deter '' .

`` radical '' christian take gospel seriously .

well , whole point make `` base '' commandment 
reducible rule . 
set rule moral code 
law code algorithm act . 
thing helpful 
individual society -- use instead 
personal involvement responsibility one 's action . 
great 
commandment , anything else , call act 
god accept ultimate responsibility every action .

different body christian , beginning , urge 
different `` ethical system '' case , none . 
result , 
bizarre identify one system , however popular 
infamous christianity . 
christianity torah . 
. 
specifically christian scripture 
little , anything , way `` commandment '' -- little 
`` christian '' desperately want commandment go `` mining '' 
almost support thus almost obvious limitation 
effort . 
one , single , thing gospel jesus 
specifically `` give '' `` commandment '' `` love one another . '' 
expand point reply paul hudson 
hope get day -- quite true 
christian infer lot commandment nt ; ` ll 
point go inference , 
huge amount `` cultural baggage '' involve . 
quite right `` goo '' one look ethical 
system . 
anyone look ethical system , since 
society eager hand one matter ?
