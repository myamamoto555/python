level 5 ? 
many ? 
different level ? 
never 
hear rating system . 
anyone care clue ? 
rating system use arpa organization 
measure maturity ` software process ' i.e. entire process 
software get design , write , test , deliver , support 
etc. . 
see ` manage software process ' , watts s. humphrey , addison 
wesley 1989 . 
excellent software engineering text . 
5 level 
software process maturity : 
1 . 
initial 
2 . 
repeatable 
3 . 
define 
4 . 
manage 
5 . 
optimize 
level approximately characterize follow : 
1 . 
statistically software process control . 
statistical 
basis estimate large software , long 
take produce , expensive , reliable 
. 
software production level . 
2 . 
stable process statistical control , rigorous project 
management ; something , . 
project 
plan detail , software configuration 
management quality assurance . 
3 . 
process define understand , implementation 
consistent . 
include thing like software inspection , 
rigorous software testing framework , configuration management , 
typically ` software engineering process group ' within 
project . 
4 . 
statistical information software systematically gather 
analyze , process control basis 
information . 
software quality measure goal . 
5 . 
defect prevent , process automate , software contract 
effective certified .
