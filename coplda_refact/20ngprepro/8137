well , actually , base really happen 
base fantasy happen . 
ok , understand 
hockey background . 
stats like `` '' make rbi look good . 
viola 's fault boston offense ? 
morris 
blue jays strong offense ? 
tell morris 
magical ability cause offensive player score run .

compare . 
know team 
> would without viola . 
analysis fallacious . 
ok , answer , . 
question 
sure fair number answer . 
please 
answer yes , roger : 
pitcher cause offensive player team score run ? 
al , please . 
anyone else follow along , well-known demonstrable fact 
team 's win-loss record closely related number run 
team score number team allow . 
definite , 
function , definitely correlation . 
fact , 
rule thumb , team b score x run team allow y run , 
every 10 run fewer y team b allow , win another game . 
, instance , look 1991 toronto blue jays , find 
score 780 run allow 682 , morris allow 114 . 

thing equal , frank viola , 3.44 era replace jack 
morris 240.2 inning morris throw plausible , since viola throw 238 
boston , `` red jays '' would allow 15 fewer run , 
enough 1-2 win . 
, take account viola 
pitched half inning fenway , harder park pitch 
particularly lefthander skydome . 
, um , roger . 
unless 
really believe pitcher somehow affect number run 
team score , could enlighten fallacy 
analysis ? 
clearly , would foolhardy claim viola would 
necessarily put 3.44 jay last year , 
claim . 
look actual performance 
evaluate viola 's better morris ' sense `` morris 
perform viola , team would better . '' 
> take open mind really truly understand happen

true , open brain fall .
