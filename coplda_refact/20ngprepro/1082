, distinction seem quite arbitrary . 
bless man whose iniquity forgive , whose sin cover . 
p . 
. 
quote apostle paul : 
even david also blessedness man , unto god 
righteousness without work , 
say , bless whose iniquity forgive , whose sin 
cover . 
bless man lord impute sin . 
rom . 
4:6 -8 
biblical perspective seem cover 
concept testament . 
dispensational 
distinction unwarranted . 
> millenium , read sin deal immediately 
> present ie christ present earth rulership christ . 
sure rex scripture back . 
suggest jesus 
go travel around deal individual violation law -- 
million perhaps billion people .

consider unwise cf. ex . 
18:13 ff . 
make interesting 
speculation , though .
