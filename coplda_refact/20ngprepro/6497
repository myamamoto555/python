yes , typically . 
every wild flight fancy serve 
serve appropriate relation hypothesis . 

somewhat interesting anyone challange provide 
example sort one come one 
. 
surely , must . 
apparently regard

successful hypothesis propose . 
non-rational ? 
course hope currently least explain 
daydream snake fire bite tail . 
surely daydream . 
special 
one ? 
could something perceive 
analogy geometry snake problem concern 
geometry molecule ? 
analogical reasoning `` '' ? 
rather heart science 's notion abduction ,
