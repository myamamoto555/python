best mass participatory prayer . 
... 
live kick scream 60 70 
catholics invite participate liturgy instead count 
rosary bead mass , find comment interesting . 

_ massively _ longer tradition proclaim passion account 
without active participation . 
know latin , one really 
beautiful way hear passion chant three 
deacon : narrator chant middle baritone range , jesus chant 
bass , directly quote handle high tenor . 
actually basis common proclamation passion 
john would prefer . 
always judgement call base pastoral consideration . 
pastor make decision conspiracy 
participation . 
palm sunday liturgy , initial 
blessing distribution palm procession , already 
get long get passion ; pastor feel 
make people stand long narrative . 
also , 
orchestrate proclamation multiple reader public participation 
crowd quotation run longer proclamation 
-- church multiple mass sunday , might 
necessary go briefer option `` get 'em get 'em 
'' . 
parish different . 
catholics longer canonically tie 
geographic parish . 
possible another catholic parish 
columbus area base ohio state address liturgy 
closer preference . 
talk fellow 
parishioner see common preference -- pastor 
generally willing listen non-confrontational request . 
though 
probably bring along paramedic case react strongly 
shock people ask _ longer _ sunday mass. . 
perhaps problem recent liturgical development follow 
continuous evolution model accumulation small change , 
single one hard take rather punctuate 
equilibrium model thing stay get accustom , 
marked mutation hit . 
apology 
name evolutionary theory .
