thanks clue , thanks derek ho also pointer 
direction . 
one solution , due derek ho : popup pop , 
location -- repeat popup unchanged 
previous popup . 
slow response avoid call 
first , use require location different . 
problem also avoid make tiny alteration 
location popup , really change 
location popup . 
try double check 
source problem . 
solution try successfully follow : 
1 use `` twm '' `` mwm '' rather `` '' 
2 use `` '' , resource '' : 10 '' 
3 reset location popup window truely change . 
obviously work around bug somewhere . 
thanks -- chris
