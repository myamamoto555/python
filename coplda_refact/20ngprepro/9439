actually , fossil fuel plant run hotter usual 
reactor nuclear plant . 
gripe industry 
nuclear power use 1900 vintage steam technology . 

important nuclear plant get cold end system 
cold possible . 
hence big cooling tower . 
oil gas fire steam plant also condenser , 
usually size get steam back hot water , 
way ambient . 
plant cool condenser water , 
rather air ; one canadian official , ask `` thermal 
pollution '' river , say , `` , view heat resource '' . 
everybody run closed-cycle boiler . 
water use 
purify solid , otherwise crud boiler plumbing 
water boil . 
purify water boiler use bigger job 
cool , boiler water recycle .
