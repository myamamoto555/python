40 year `` make desert bloom '' 
bedouin low crop yield - 350 400 kilogram 
barley per hectare rainy year - farming 
technique primitive , production base solely 
animal human labor . 
must also underscore animal 
production , although low , base entirely pasturing . 
production increase considerably rainy year 
diminish significantly drought year . 
bedouin pasture 
animal - goat , camel sheep - ability gain weight 
quickly relatively rainy winter withstand many 
waterless day hot summer .

result centuries-old process natural selection harsh 
local condition . 
creation state israel , 80 percent negev 
bedouin expel sinai southern jordan . 

10,000 allow remain confine territory 
40,000 hectare region annual mean 150 
mm - quantity low enough ensure crop failure two year

rare water well south central negev , 
spring life desert , cement prevent bedouin 
shepherd roaming . 
bedouin shepherd allow stay central negev . 
1982 , sinai return egypt , 
bedouin also eliminate . 
time , strong pressure 
apply bedouin abandon cultivation field 
order land could transfer army . 
reliable statistics exist concern amount land hold 
today negev bedouin . 
known fact large part 
40,000 hectare cultivate 1950 seize
