one thing consider time division multiplex emg 
channel reduce number rf carrier generate . 
multiplex emg input , would probably 
sufficient physiology study would ~ 330 hz per 
channel sampling rate . 
level analog multiplexing 
rather easy accomplish . 
combine lot rf carrier pretty tricky without 
generate intermodulation . 
system carry runner 
fairly harsh environment would probably difficult 
keep balanced . 
commercial hand-held could probably employ 
little modification accomodate widen bandwidth . 
obviously , accordance whatever law 
govern use location .
