reason color board depend solder 
may 1993 cover qst picture three different board without 
solder mask tell copper color trace . 
box 
label 2304 brown board , one 
center grayish board expose . 
left 
fiberglass board look green . 
see reason 
put solder mask circuit board use box cover . 
wonder manufacturer actually put solder mask 
low noise microwave preamp ? 
often , microwave circuit odd

make unit work properly commercial product ? 
. 

solder mask would certainly make tougher , never mind 
finding something minimally degrade circuit . 
q dope 
coil improve q -- hold thing together 
minimal loss .
