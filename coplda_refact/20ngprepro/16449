alvarez post good partial solution problem 
. 
'll present variant instead , since feel 
bit stronger likely attempt cheat . 
depend 
protocol follow read traffic . 
briefly , cop get 
wiretap warrant , record call . 
notice encryption 
disclosure header . 
, along copy warrant , 
send fbi , whoever hold family key . 

decrypt header , send serial number n 
encrypted session key u k escrow agent . 
, turn , use u1 
u2 recover k , send local police . 
note solve problem wiretap forever . 
neither 
cop fbi ever see u , read traffic . 
every 
request must validate fbi escrow agent . 

cop fbi together cheat , since u. 
regard likely pairing folk might try beat 
system . 
prevent modify alvarez 's scheme . 

escrow agent read conversation , since ; 
n u k . 
police even see n. 
harder see block decryption old , warrantless , 
wiretap . 
one protection -- persuade escrow 
agent call current . 
nearly strong . 
approach see might work , involve sequence 
datum unalterable medium , complete cryptographic protection 
insertion onto new medium . 
anything yet 
complex comfort , hard install real 
world . 
nsa might answer ; may may smarter 
, work week , year .
