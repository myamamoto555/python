- allergy medicine , huh ? 
get rid resultant migraine 
whatever , actually suppress allergic reaction ? 
i.e. like 
antihistamine ? 
far doctor concerned , slip 
eat something allergic even test tell 
avoid tough ; _ cheap _ medicine alleviate symptom , 
fine , otherwise suffer . 
one doctor prescribe imigran cost 
nhs # 48 6 tablet rehydrate would throw 
four solid day could even drink water - get take 
move change doctor . 
reasoning : know 
side-effect new . 
ok , fine - pass 
safety test get prescription list , anyway prepare take 
risk quality life . 
alternative get 
prescribe privately , afford , pay private allergy 
specialist test tell avoid . 
fairly certain 
allergic one chemical additive , lot thing eat 
nothing common except thing know safe , test really 
option ; many permutation .

yes , notice - work eat tolerance 
level fairly regularly . 
eat anything except home cooking month 
lose work scratch ... bad experience . 

know early-warning symptom , though , usually tell whether 
allergic food eat much ... usually ...
