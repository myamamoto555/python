re : text white house announcement q&a clipper chip encryption 
organization : computer science dept , indiana university 
distribution : na 
lines : 57 
announcement somewhat disconcerting ; anything 
evil , bode badly future open 
algorithm standard information security . 
start 
panicking de rsa stuff like prohibit , 
little anxious . 
doubt long someone post 
explain small part far-ranging 
long-lived conspiracy 
subvert freedom , democracy , mathematics . 
feeling 
administration probably worried thing like des 
rsa pgp , since 'll never use group much 
wider computer geek . 
fact come suggest one two thing : 
1 . 
nsa work long time , 
happen `` ready '' release world time . 
2 . 
nsa work long time , able 
get bush administration go along plan . 

find unlikely would sympathy 
use cryptography ; likely 
administration feel even escrow , , 
know , trivially breakable cryptography make 
widely available . 
thus say clipper chip announcement : 
> new technology help company protect proprietary 
> information , protect privacy personal phone conversation 
> prevent unauthorized release datum transmit 
> electronically . 
time technology preserve 
> ability federal , state local law enforcement agency 
> intercept lawfully phone conversation criminal . 
majority discussion involve `` clipper chip '' seem 
pertain encryption telephone conversation . 
anyone 
know mean chip design work primarily analog 
signal ? 
language sort suggest , hard say . 
main thing get whether chip implement 
symmetric asymmetric cryptographic technique . 
anybody know ? 
guess symmetric , get clear . 

symmetric , useful anything 
encryption identical chip end ? 
negotiate 
key use symmetric cryptography without use trust 
third party know key ? 
even use 
key ? 
asymmetric , pkp 's patent , claim cover 
method asymmetric cryptography ? 
get 
royalty , hide infringement real reason keep 
algorithm secret ?
