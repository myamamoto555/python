would point long-term monitoring thing like 
particle field , mention atmospheric phenomenon . 
however , 
particular plan establish sort monitor network . 
precise , particular plan , period . 
large 
part problem . 
context , surprising unexciting 
useful mission like get short shrift budget time . 
closest 
approach sort long-term planetary monitoring mission 
occasional chance piggyback something like top flashier 
mission like galileo cassini .

unlikely much happen pluto would 
worth monitoring , prohibitively difficult mission fly 
without new propulsion technology something planetary community 
firmly resist guinea pig . 
combined need 
arrive pluto within reasonable amount time , kill nearly 
cruise velocity settle orbit , beyond 
reasonably current , propulsion .

. 
well earth . 
thing 
, better spacecraft 
constrain need enter orbit around planet .
