budget allocate `` upgrade '' , `` maintenance '' , `` new purchase '' ,

depreciate longer period , budget office justify 
expense actually use machine accounting , 
payroll , etc. . 
, budget office dependant engineer 
reason like payroll account , would sure hell see every 
engineer new cray desktop every year .
