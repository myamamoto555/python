'll freely admit :

need form therapy . 
necessarily 
analyst , maybe learn gun . 
fear 
seem base ignorance false knowledge . 
see person

legitimate basis ? 
first-hand experience lend 
validity fear ? 
fear base mediated experience , 
i.e. anecdote network news ? 
trust 
see lack legitimacy mediated input ? 
afraid people mention ? 
forgive , 
sound afraid point paranoia . 
perhaps talk 
someone . 
say rude , 
think anyone fear deep baseless seem 
need sort help . 
live fear really suck , even
