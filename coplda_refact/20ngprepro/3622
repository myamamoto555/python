interface simple circuit run 9v 
cpu board run . 
. 
lead side , put signal want 10k resistor 
base . 
transistor side , tie 
cpu input line collector pull-up resistor 
. 
function ok , seem slow . 
detect pulse 
occur , much faster . 

time device , something like ? 

able detect target , get . 
use wire go cpu 
test pin 8 inch long , 
anything high-speed . 
art electronics , mention tie base 
ground resistor improve 
speed . 
need ? 
calculate 
resistor value ?
