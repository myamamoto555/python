well , someone microsoft tell wrong . 
windows use swap file 
larger recommend size . 
last summer go microsoft 
windows 3.1 technical workshop distribute lot information 
general public might aware . 
anyway main book 
hand section `` create larger recommend 
'' . 
'll quote information 
create permanent larger recommend size , 
receive message tell windows use anything 
larger recommend size . 
error message incorrect , 
allow use larger , four time amount 
ram machine . 
see , microsoft know information incorrect . 

probably run new job 
tell little know . 
may , would really suggest everyone take 
opportunity go technical workshops . 
actually 
incredibly in-depth , get lot material bug 
optimization straight know . 
besides offer 
huge discount software . 
remember correctly , could pick 
word 2.0 , excel 4.0 , whatever presentation program $ 130 . 
full blow version , upgrade educational version . 

could also pick microsoft office $ 500 something like . 

spring word . 
well , hope helpful someone . 
besides hope someone 
go workshop save little money . 
anyone microsoft read -- really love product . 
need job graduate also , work something ?

thanks ,
