introduction 
april 16 , president announce new initiative bring 
together federal government industry voluntary program 
provide secure communication meet legitimate need 
law enforcement . 
heart plan new encryption 
chip call `` clipper chip '' together approach 
escrow key . 
two escrow agency use , key part 
need reconstruct key . 
chip contents 
clipper chip contain classified 64-bit block 
encryption algorithm call `` skipjack . '' 
algorithm use 80 bit key 
compare 56 des 32 round scramble 
compare 16 des . 
support 4 des mode 
operation . 
algorithm take 32 clock tick , electronic 
codebook ecb mode run 12 mbit per second . 
chip include follow component : 
skipjack encryption algorithm 
f , 80-bit family key common chip 
n , 30-bit serial number length subject change 
u , 80-bit secret key unlock message encrypt chip 
chip program , inc. , call 
`` . '' 
silicon supply vlsi technology inc. . 

implement 1 micron technology initially sell 
$ 30 quantity 10,000 . 
price drop 
technology shrink .8 micron . 
encrypt chip 
see chip use , imagine embed at&t 
telephone security device . 
suppose call someone 
device . 
push button start secure 
conversation , security device negotiate 80-bit session key k 
device end . 
key negotiation take place 
without clipper chip . 
general , method key exchange 
use diffie-hellman public-key distribution method . 
session key k establish , clipper chip use 
encrypt conversation message stream m digitized voice . 

telephone security device feed k m chip produce two 
value : 
e m ; k , encrypted message stream , 
e e k ; u + n ; f , law enforcement field , 
transmit telephone line . 
law enforcement 
field thus contain session key k encrypt unit key u 
serial number n , encrypt family 
key f. law enforcement field decrypt law enforcement 
authorize wiretap install . 
ciphertext e m ; k decrypt receiver 's device use 
session key : 
d e m ; k ; k m . 
chip programming escrow 
clipper chips program inside scif secure compartmented 
information facility , essentially vault . 
scif contain 
laptop computer equipment program chip . 
300 chip 
program single session . 
scif located 
. 
beginning session , trust agent two key 
escrow agency enter vault . 
agent 1 enter secret , random 
80-bit value s1 laptop agent 2 enter secret , random 
80-bit value s2 . 
random value serve seed generate unit 
key sequence serial number . 
thus , unit key 
function 160 secret , random bit , agent know 80 . 
generate unit key serial number n , 30-bit value n 
first pad fix block produce 64-bit block n1 . 
s1 s2 use key n1 , produce 
64-bit block r1 : 
r1 e d e n1 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 . 
similarly , n pad two block produce n2 
n3 , two additional 64-bit block r2 r3 compute : 
r2 e d e n2 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 
r3 e d e n3 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 . 
r1 , r2 , r3 together , give 192 bit . 

first 80 bit assign u1 second 80 bit u2 . 

rest discard . 
unit key u xor u1 u2 . 
u1 u2 
key part separately escrow two escrow 
agency . 
sequence value u1 , u2 , u generate , 
write onto three separate floppy disk . 
first disk contain 
file serial number contain corresponding key part 
u1 . 
second disk similar contain u2 value . 
third 
disk contain unit key u. agent 1 take first disk agent 
2 take second disk . 
thus agent walk away know 
80-bit seed 80-bit key part . 
however , agent 
know 80 bit use generate key 80-bit 
key part . 
third disk use program chip . 
chip 
program , information discard vault agent 
leave . 
laptop may destroy additional assurance 
information leave behind . 
protocol may change slightly four people 
room instead two . 
first two would provide seed s1 s2 , 
second two escrow agent would take disk back 
escrow agency . 
escrow agency yet determine , 
nsa , cia , fbi , law enforcement agency . 
one 
may independent government . 
law enforcement use 
law enforcement authorize tap encrypted line , 
first take warrant service provider order get 
access communication line . 
let assume tap 
place determine line encrypt 
clipper chip . 
law enforcement field first decrypt 
family key f , give e k ; u + n. documentation certify tap 
authorize party associate serial number n 
send e.g. , via secure fax key escrow agent , 
return e.g. , also via secure fax u1 u2 . 
u1 u2 
together produce unit key u , e k ; u decrypt get 
session key k. finally message stream decrypt . 

accomplish special black box decoder . 
capstone : next generation 
successor clipper chip , call `` capstone '' government 
`` '' , already develop . 
include 
skipjack algorithm , digital signature standard dss , 
secure hash algorithm sha , method key exchange , fast
