mr. , take exception . 

verifiable , previous example level u.s. government 
abuse gun-control restriction .

worry abuse recent past might abused 
thye future .

stop put hand stove .

north american continent europe , matter many 
people would like . 
drug illegal ` re 
. 
year canada crow gun control . 

necessary control gun whole continent , canada 
always comparable rate u.s. , yet still . 
unless tell canadian border much 
magical mexican border shorter far 
heavily patrol really accept argument . 
> mixing weapon thing use one :

, approximately 31,000 death due gun u.s. , 
two-third suicide . 
unfortunately suicide

half death rate .

problem 's human since stone axis . 

fct matter simply : nobody ever assault anybody , 
whether weapon sort around would totally 
irrelevent . 
yet weapon build . 
would suggest , , murderous 
impulse humanity pre-date weapon . 
anyway , bosnians et al. make excellent attempt 
kill half thousand year . 
take away gun , even 
could , would neither halt killing reduce brutality . 
> 50 % murder axis , would impose regulation

> example , flame exactly 50 % kill gun ... 
u.s. , approximately 60 % murder commit firearm . 
50 % handgun , 10 % . 
reason say gun , per 
se , problem , rate exceed europe 's 
country entire violent crime rate . 
really think get 
knife fist . 
case , think example gun control apply u.s. 
failure , like drug prohibition form 
prohibition . 
deal people 
, solve problem . 
problem 
violent crime , concentrate tool instead . 

vast majority gun never , ever misuse . 
order 
99.5 % entire lifetime gun . 
say 
make argument gun cause misuse . 
> think situation los angeles people buy gun protect 
> . 
good situation ?? 
situation `` good '' people fear life . 
recall scene last riot , 
protect shop gun . 
would better , 
, lose livelihood ? 
> way deal problem ?? 
problem poverty rage los angeles , . 
however , problem become violent action , yes , 
appropriate . 
whether person hurt condition 
make less dead burn house . 
examine problem refer . 

discuss someone violently assault , 
perfectly legitimate response make stop . 
hopefully 
simply let know prepare shoot would enough , 
above-mentioned . 
> everybody buy gun protect criminal neighbor 
> gun think happen ?? 
mean everybody gun usa 
45 % households form firearm , usually long gun . 
account level access least 100 million americans . 
firearm ownership likely among educate , well-off whites , 
group least likely involve violent crime . 
may take worth .
