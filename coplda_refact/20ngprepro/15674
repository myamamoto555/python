go bad worse . 
3-in-1 , 1-in-3 bad enough . 
like god pray . 
refuse believe jesus pray 
-- let 's get real , scripture say pray 
father , father someone different son . 

problem multiple god . 
, whole context scripture 
say : perfect , even father heaven ; 
co-heir christ ; like . 
co-heirs share thing equally -- include knowledge , power , dominion etc. . 
like christ , -- god . 
god , powerful -- god . 
, liar -- god . 
, greatest god . 
know anyone say jesus pray . 

whole point trinity enough distinction 
within god relationship possible . 
imply sort 
communication . 
assume `` native '' form , father 
son directly enough connect prayer sense 
involve . 
jesus incarnation son , i.e. logos 
make flesh . 
human form , human action limit 
human capability . 
communication father take 
form prayer . 
see anything problematical 
. 
seem implicit whole idea incarnation .
