aaahh ... problem near dear heart . 
case , 
monitor cause problem - deflection coil monitor 
specific . 
also see monitor back fuse panel exhibit 
problem . 
sound like problem since flourescent lite , motor , etc 
several 10 foot away seem far cause , 
juice run must pass nearby monitor . 
fusebox side 
wall maybe ? 
start spec ` ing panasonic video monitor 3 switchable input 
line vid & aud one < $ 400 . 
stop wavy interference 
effect computer monitor next . 
problem . 
need know mu shield 
common , fact almost mandatory electrostatic deflection type 
. 
talk ee prof. say get coffee , cut end , mount 
around deflection coil interfere monitor . 
careful avoid high voltage circuitry . 
especially thicker high 
voltage anode lead usually colored red . 
kill , 
!!! 
use plastic non-conducting stand-off 
mount . 
, would assume good keep mag field also 
good keep , hopefully 'll work mount shield 
monitor interfere well . 
, start shield 
source .
