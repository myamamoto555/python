revelation 2-3 , see first century church , one 
congregation major city . 
one unify church . 

city , people different culture . 
naturally , 
form something stew , different member different 
heritage . 
nevertheless , one body . 
meet together , 
sometimes smaller group home sometimes bigger group 
place temple court . 
particular city , , find 
common language associate region . 
instance , rome , latin 
speak . 
united states today , english speak . 
would 
make sense congregation different city would speak common 
language necessarily latin . 
naturally , would expect lead evangelist preach common 
language . 
first century church , probably many people 
congregation could speak give tongue translate 
message people foreign ethnic group . 
today , however , 
see people speak tongue translate sermon , even so-called 
pentacostal church . 
modern day equivalent though -- 
bi-lingual speaker . 
unify church member - 
sometimes call international churches christ , meet 
together sundays , headphone people speak 
english hear ongoing translation sermon 
native tongue . 
neat idea , huh ? 
, meet different size group random sort way sundays , 
sometimes meeting haitians spanish - 
speak people , example , hear evangelist preach 
native language . 
addition , meet small group couple time 
week bible discussion group devotional . 
someone 
speak different language almost always people also 
speak language assume congregation large enough 
meeting . 
people speak common language , keep touch 
culture , want , also equally deep 
friendship among church relationship people many various 
nationality . 
> purpose church thwart action ? 
action let catholics worship native language instead 
latin ? 
indeed ! 
see second paragraph response second 
clipping article . 
however , mean action form denomination base 
culture , purpose church indeed thwart . 
'll assume second answer next clipping .

guess - aaron 
meet need people , certainly , help proud 
cultural heritage denomination . 
yet 
largely isolate quality `` christian '' friendship 
outside nationality denomination . 
shall certainly give people place feel comfortable 
heritage . 
however , way destroy church 
unity , rather encourage friendship among disciple . 
> approach group cite . 
sound like group wonderful intention , go 
thing wrong way . 
name like african methodist 
episcopal church still make cringe , although much . 
understand racism past cause 
group form , try unite . 
know 
hard many people newsgroup imagine one 
body people earth , quite possible , work 
make happen . 
however , might smaller step towards unity , 
would take word `` african '' denomination 's name . 

perhaps someday long time , also remove `` methodist 
episcopal '' part also , simply part `` church '' . 
> regard inclusivity , note tht . 
sig emit mit .

shall conduct campus church

shall

> transition culture , language , think ? 
shall one church , sake unity , shall useful 
help student new america make transition culture , 
language , think . 
make new denomination try 
solve problem . 
whole denominational mindset cause 
problem , sadly . 
> ame church , retain african root 
> expression , means exclusive . 
since live 
> cambridge , invite visit local assembly : 
thank invitation . 
show indeed 
heart spread gospel jesus well take part cultural 
heritage . 
thank also respond post . 
know well 
time-consuming . 
whole idea celebrate culture pave good intention , 
still feel must restore preserve unity 
time . 
church , boston church , singing 
mention post , yet limit expression mexican 
culture , even though mit campus ministry spanish 
speaking zone . 
make commitment god go 
sunday service church , know brother sister 
fully devote love god disciple . 
believe tongue , may already pick , 
understanding biblical christianity . 
however , certainly 
willing visit congregation provide interfere 
normal worship . 
since also live cambridge , also extend 
invitation visit service often like .

ave. 
9am sunday leave worship simply call wednesday 
night find service hold particular day .

occasionally later earlier 1-3 time per year .
