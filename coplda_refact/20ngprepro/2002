two thought . 
- think psychologically easier next 
generation accept genetic manipulation . 
seem people frown 
upon ` mess nature ' , ignore practice . 
new human intervention ` arrogance hubris ' manipulation 
routinely ` natural ' certainly ` big deal ' . 
- interesting human trait probably massively 
full trade-off . 
addition , without positive 
social environment cultivation genetic gift , 
advantage make . 
people certainly pursue 
grail , know quest turn .
