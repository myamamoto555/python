book worth read get sensible view issue . 
book two section . 
section 1 contain fairly reasonable 
analysis bible , show many inconsistency bible 
modern science . 
well know , surprise . 
section 2 analysis koran 's version old testament story , 
seem , face , present good case show koran 
consistent modern science . 
however , plain , 
consistency possible vague phraseology 
koran . 
take flood , example , bible full detail , 
`` forty day forty night '' , `` pair every animal '' , etc. , 
know nonsense . 
koran 's description event 
obscure make possible interpretation `` big river 
flood day cause much damage '' . 
yes , contradiction 
also much fact . 
koran might consistent modern science , 
consistent due vagueness compare book 
time , seem much achievement . 
book conclude say something like , koran must 
divine inspiration time write lot 
ridiculous idea universe , none 
find koran ! 
argue greatness book 
talk contain seem absurd extreme . 
, course , memory may miss point .
