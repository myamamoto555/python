judgement call part scorer sac fly rbi 's ? 
situation bring question : 
red sox bottom 9th score 5-1 . 
mariners 
basis load 1 . 
batter hit fly center , 
fielder catch . 
runner third tag score without throw . 
, without judgement call think one , 
batter . 
seem better name would `` defensive 
indifference '' , since really matter whether guy third score 
point . 
know , think several `` mariners steal third 
second , open base would allow , batter hit 
grounder third baseman get deep hole 
third , would play home , third , second , 
maybe therefore make throw first get last , etc. . 
. 
scenario , . 
_ really _ matter guy score way 
4 ? 
tie run go score , guy third . 
point batter imo get `` credit '' utterly 
fail job - point get hit walk , 
trade one run . 
guy think ? 
regards , 
burke charles s. homan
