similar reaction chinese food come different 
conclusion . 
eat chinese food age never problem . 
go 
chinese malaysian friend swanky rest . 
order 
lot stuff never see . 
thing remember 
meal first course , scallop serve shell sauce . 
think , `` well , scallop sick 
could coincidence '' . 
night sit bathroom floor , 
sweating empty stomach hard way , decide would never touch 
another scallop . 
may allergic want take chance .
