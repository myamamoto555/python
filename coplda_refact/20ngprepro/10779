know , despite lack full game telecast last week , still 
much hockey atlanta . 
atlanta 's abc decline pick 
playoff game till . 
even show game , 
continue skip first half hour telecast . 
know 
still better situation compare rest georgia , alabama , etc. , 
still pretty annoying . 
least pittsburgh , network show show local affiliate . 
ask problem . 
tell local 1.9 rating 
bad consider first nhl game show long time 
without much promotion . 
besides , syndicate programming afternoon 
usually low rate . 
lose show nhl playoff . 
tell contractual obligation . 
ask golf 
show oin abc , would contractual obligation come way . 
come 
contractual obligation come way last week 's telecast ? 

could give coherent answer . 
also , add atlanta one highest neutral site game 
attendance demographic good . 
think abc network 
begin tie high rate program like roseanne 
thier sport programming . 
hope everyone atlanta read call wsb 2 complain 
. 
tell stop watch news telecast 
since seem unprofessional handle situation . 
lady seem settle single reason . 
sometimes , reason 
low rating . 
another time , say contractual obligation .
