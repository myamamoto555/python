gordon banks write : 

; probably within 50 year , new type eugenics possible . 
; maybe even sooner . 
map human genome . 

; start work manipulation genome . 
use genetic 
; engineering , able insert whatever gene want . 
; breeding , `` hybrid '' , etc. . 
ethical question , 
; ? 
two past problem eugenics 
1 reduce gene pool 
2 define status . 
insert gene would seem reduce gene pool unless insert 
gene later become transmissible progeny . 
may able 
crowd `` garbage gene . '' 
may future become possible . 
even 
, awareness need maintain gene pool would hopefully 
mean provision make save gene may come handy 
later . 
evidently gene sickle cell disease equatorial africa 
diabetes hopi promote survival condition . 

really know future may hold environment . 

reduce wilderness - capacity relatively inbred 
domesticated animal come mind . 
, nuclear winter , ice age , 
meteor impact , new microbiological threat , famine , global warming , etc. , 
etc. , conceivable . 
therefore , many gene possible 
available good strategy species survival . 
course , status genetically altered individual would start 
different anyone else 's . 
could make 
`` '' great body long life , would 
want give elevated status ? 
could . 
romans 
king without benefit eugenics . 
race eventually 
realize deal problem cause , , 
problem . 
orwell introduce notion might happen 
person genetically alter menial task . 
nothing 
new sun . 
treat slave way millennium 
`` 1984 . '' 
see inherent problem gene therapy avoid least 2 
problem . 
human always trouble virtue wisdom 
use power fall hand good end time . 

stop race whole yet . 
many civilization 
die inability adapt environmental change . 
however , also 
many civilization die abuse 
power . 
one survive hopefully learn lesson 
fate , survive make better choice 
turn come . 
think gene alter power could wipe 
face earth cause endless suffering . 
nuclear power global 
warm whatever could may still , . 
real issue issue wisdom virtue . 
personally think 
man enough wisdom virtue pull next challenge 
better last . 
, , may make , 
may . 
, hope reservoir `` garbage '' people 
backwater otherwise long discard `` garbage '' gene 
pull . 
believe real problem probably always . 
man need accept input great spirit god overcome 
lack area know use power . 
man , 
believe man may , listen obey still small voice god 
heart . 
way begin recieve wisdom virtue 
need escape problem consequent poor choice . 
peoples 
die many reason . 
society fail accept enough 
input god safely use power develop destroy 
, often process . 
self-evident 
one survive today either accept enough input spirit 
use power wisely enough avoid survive mistake 
thus far , else enough power long enough . 
summary , would say question whether use new 
technology really ancient one . 
answer , way hard , 
way easy , ancient answer . 
power , 
spirit . 
sorry long post . 
got carry away .
