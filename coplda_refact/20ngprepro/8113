get rid key actually pretty easy automatically 
communication link , oppose storage key 
retain somehow long owner want able retrieve 
datum . 
right way communication security generate random 
session key diffie hellman , use destroy 
. 
go , get back , way decrypt 
recording conversation . 
make sure attack man middle , 
authenticate dh exchange . 
at&t secure phone 
display dh key compare verbally 
phone . 
nice simple , rely user awareness 
plus inability man middle duplicate user ' 
voice . 
better way authenticate exchange rsa . 
since would 
never use rsa actual encryption , compromise rsa secret key 
would allow someone impersonate future conversation , 
even revoke public key . 
would still 
able decrypt recording prior conversation 
session key destroy . 
convinced government 's secure phone 
must work . 
neat , eh ?
