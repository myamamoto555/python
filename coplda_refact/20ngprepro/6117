never like passenger try shift weight 
turn ... find weight shift sudden 
unnerve . 
one thing get comfortable 
decide look shoulder , recommend 
shift weight turn ... violent . 
also think someone already say make sure passenger 
wear good gear . 
sometimes choose ride without helmet 
lack safety gear depend feel 
let passenger . 
handle , 
would want hurt anyone else , let without 
glove , jacket , least jeans , heavy boot , helmet fit

go real easy . 
amazing solid grip 
handle bar passenger . 
make feel like 
go slide back , `` snappy '' turn 
sickening lurch . 
general , feel much less controlled 
smooth passenger . 
stand back 
brother 's bike , ride aggressively ride know 
good pilot ... still , everything feel unsteady ` re 
passenger .
