fine . 
libertarian anarchist alone uncomfortable 
use state sponsor coercion . 
notion coercion 
virtually eliminate society properly 
eliminate part state longer worth serious 
consideration view peculiar libertarian anarchist . 
example , `` force '' coercion include tax collection ? 
include minimal level regulation commerce envision 
adam smith ? 
since coercion exercise actor 
state , state deal ? 
exclusively 
fact compulsion ?

jest ! 
well , must admit picture libertarian amway participant 
somewhat reassuring idea try govern 
complex , conflictual , industrial society . 
would venture point , 
however , libertarian could convince least 85 % group 
`` seminar participant '' `` embrace '' philosophy , 
propaganda skill need hone . 
frankly , however , great trick create government 
society almost everyone assume agree proper 
government policy . 
assume , sort annoying formality 
dispense , election , police , etc. . 
mr. marx say , 
state wither away . 
way , however , would like explain eliminate 
virtually policy restrain private coercion 
current society help live happier life ? 
like 
socialism ; short-term pain 'll bear 
everyone benefit `` re-education '' regular 
`` seminar '' training ?
