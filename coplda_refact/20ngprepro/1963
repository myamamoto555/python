point darren raise lutheran viewpoint . 
reason gift god , also infect sin . 
yet reject reason entirely -- neither , think , 
darren . 
need reason , darren point 
, comprehend god 's revelation bible . 
reason alone sufficient comprehend believe 
word . 
need , first foremost , faith . 
`` sinful 
mind hostile god . 
submit god 's law , 
'' romans 8:7 . 
luther accept scripture sole means revelation 
`` sola scriptura '' , accept necessity use 
reason faith comprehend revelation . 
yet luther also say , regard baptism , `` mad reason 
rush forth , , baptism dazzling like 
work , regard worthless . '' 
large 
catechism , fourth part , baptism . 
make matter 
complicate , luther sort theologian many 
people would describe ` absolutist ' . 
see 
describe ` take prisoner ' theologian . 
might conclude , give observation , luther 
inconsistent mad . 
surely least 
come conclusion . 
might useful 
recall jesus also call mad . 
peter feel 
compel defend apostle 
charge drunkenness pentecost . 
christian 
ought careful reject luther 
mad . 
rather , imitate , 
examine scriptures every day see paul 
say true act 17:11 . 
basis confidence luther , peter , paul , many 
preach gospel reason , faith holy 
spirit . 
faith divorce reason , faith 
guide , inform , use reason . 
spirit enable know 
truth proclaim boldly . 
god want preach 
message `` think jesus might rise dead '' 
rather `` know redeemer live ! '' 
job 19:25 . 
christian 
side pilate say `` truth ? '' 
rather 
follow christ , say , `` fact , reason bear , 
come world , testify truth . 
everyone 
side truth listen '' john 18:37 . 
know truth god promise 
know truth . 
jesus say , `` hold teaching , 
really disciple . 
know truth , 
truth set free '' john . 
proverb 
urge `` buy truth , sell . '' 
pr . 
psalmist pray `` snatch word truth mouth '' 
p . 
evidently believe word truth 
fact ` mouth ' . 
yet indeed appear arrogant claim truth 
motivate . 
present 
truth teaching scripture , reveal 
spirit , invention , stand ready 
prove wrong basis scripture , luther 
, arrogant , humble . 
humbly 
trust god 's promise truth , trust 
promise forgiveness . 
> god 's revelation 
> absolute thing . 
darren > far get ? 
god 's revelation stop , 
darren > reasoning begin , possibility error appear . 
agree must make distinction clear teaching 
scripture , product reason -- even 
reasoning base scripture . 
however think would draw 
line distinction ` reasonably ' less ` academically ' 
would . 
darren > example , let 's suppose modern bible translation 
darren > include perfect rendering jesus word last supper , 
darren > jesus say , exactly , `` body . '' 
darren > 'll presume say totally without error 
darren > absolutely true . 
certain ? 
much . 
darren > moment stop speaking , people start 
darren > interpret , possibility error appear . 
mean 
darren > literally ? 
record 
darren > elaborate word . 
thinking tran - con - 
darren > substantiation ? 
say . 
darren almost point make lutheran statement 
lord 's supper . 
lutheran approach say 
jesus say , `` body , '' 
believe . 
interpretation reject simply 
teach scripture . 
recall jesus ' word stand alone subject . 
also 
paul 's word 1 corinthians 11:17 -34 , -- pass 
, receive lord . 
particular say , `` 
whenever eat bread drink cup , proclaim 
lord 's death come . '' 
word believe 
bread eat lord 's supper really bread well 
lord 's body -- sens fact tell . 
prove 
false ? 
suppose someone could say 
paul speak metaphorically lord 's body bread , simply 
way body appear eat . 
thought 
find nowhere scripture . 
reject . 
thus primary 
reason reject 
prove false , simply find scripture . 
side remark 
tell lutheran doctrine real presence 
. 
tell 
. 
tend use word . 
almost think 
use professor comparative religion , need label 
compare catholic , lutheran reformed teaching lord 's 
supper . 
almost every church want call teaching 
`` real presence '' traditional teaching 
church . 
end side remark 
darren > christian speak believe reasoning 
darren > never lead astray -- implicitly claim 
darren > infallible -- non - christian around rarely believe 
darren > implicit claim . 
witness hardly go work 
darren > person talk believe either 
darren > foolish recognize limit , intentionally try 
darren > cover . 
precisely christian rely rationalization 
witness . 
far better take approach , 
`` would like show scripture say . 
decide 
whether believe . '' 
darren > ` ' suggest people read _ 
darren > silent _ , francis schaeffer . 
think highly 
darren > , think mr schaeffer grossly overrate many 
darren > evangelical christian . 
somebody else might like , though , 
darren > let opinion stop read . 
darren > someone interested opinion , would suggest _ 
darren > certainty _ , ludwig wittgenstein . 
long trade reference , would like suggest dr. siegbert 
becker 's paperback , `` foolishness god : place reason 
lutheran theology , '' publish northwestern publishing house . 
book base becker 's doctoral thesis university 
chicago . 
david wagner `` might , power , 
confessional lutheran spirit , '' 
say lord almighty . 
zechariah 4:6 .
