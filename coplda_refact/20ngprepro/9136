spell `` loss leader ? '' 
know could . 
grocery store 
attempt make loss individual product sell 
. 
fact , argument kidney dialysis loss leader 
medical treatment lose revenue regain . 
evidence support contention . 
rather , appear 
price control discipline market force expansion 
service development improve lower-cost technology provide 
comparable benefit . 
provider continue profit rd , simply 
make less treatment would price 
rise rate uncontrolled treatment . 
question price control force price rd 
substantially actual cost doomsday 
prediction free-market advocate would see -- restriction 
service , lag technological development , etc. . 
likewise , appear 
va armed force medical care system , provider 
government agency , negative impact may occur . 
rd patient va system spokane , example , must travel 
seattle , 300 mile away , treatment . 
bottom line , however , example government 
intervention rather extreme sort appear beneficial 
result provider consumer . 
claim `` government 
bureaucracy '' inevitably lead undesirable outcome marketplace 
take case account .
