well , several burst species diversity think . 
cambrian ordovician explosion result vast increase 
animal diversity . 
likewise , one-two punch 
permian triassic extinction , number marine animal 
rise steadily all-time high prior spread 
human . 
biggest exception bye bye dino extinction 
800 family 
also , plant arise green alga colonize land 
succesive sweep . 
moss colonize wet environment first , 
fern evolve vascular tissue take territory 
evolve 1 . 
eventually mostly replace gymnosperm 
pine like 2 mostly displace angiosperm flowering 
plant -- dominant plant group planet 3 . 
fungus 
also radiate greatly invasion land . 
1 around carboniferous 200 family 
2 around triassic maybe 250 family 
3 start cretaceous rise 600 family currently 
unclear least max equilibrium number 
species earth hold ever hit 
past . 
could warning : speculation alert 
diversity never reach peak mass extinction 
happen often enough keep total number . 
would depend great deal fragmented 
specific ecosystem . 
see cowen 's book `` history life '' 
run-down , well , like title sez , history life . 
see , wilson 's `` diversity life '' view center 
current ecology -- best popular biology 
book hell , 'll say time .
