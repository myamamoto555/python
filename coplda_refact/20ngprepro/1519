quick question . 
mary immaculately , 
could pure vessel , mean without sin 
, therefore , perfect meaning sinless female human ? 
hold highly catholic church despite 
basically structure ? 
immaculately conceive , never subject original sin , 
also never commit personal sin whole life . 

possible special degree grace grant god . 
regard highly special relationship god , 
everything flow relationship . 
catholic church see new eve . 
father 
early church use particular figure lot . 
eve mother living genetic sense . 
mary 
mother living order grace . 
sin come 
eve , grace -- jesus christ -- come mary .
