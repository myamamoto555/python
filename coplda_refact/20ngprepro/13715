agree harry , however must also concede 
arab terrorism also tragedy war . 
remember 
palestinians effective target civilian 
order cause . 
irgun attack civilian 
target terrorize order might obtain 
objective , sure would . 
also 
exclude irgun 's action british soldier terrorism . 
british show sign favor compromise 
regard palestine , irgun branch group make 
point kill young british recruit mother 
father back britain would get angry britain continue 
presence palestine . 
sound like form terrorism , 
much remove arab terrorism . 
must also 
forget irgun , irgun branch group likely 
kill many jew hardline zionist , 
cooperate british . 
'll reiterate ... side screwy , 
'll favor underdog case think 
bit screw .
