ide speed come ida 8.3 sight ide come ? 
scsi complex . 
way industry use talk . 
three key difference scsi ; controller chip , port , 
software . 
. 
let look stand point . 
: asynchronous synchronous mode software driver 
asynchronous slower synchronous mode vs. 
synchronous speed reach 
rewrite software driver case mac quadra . 
8-bit : main source confusion . 
differ 
chip machine . 
mac pc 
call ` fast ' use port software driver 
produce speed inspite even 
slower asynchronous mode . 
average speed asynchronous mode 
see quadras higher end pc synchronous 
mode allow higher burst rate 
16-bit : two . 
wide require two thing 
8-bit : software driver wide port 
machine external device . 
fast also require two thing 8-bit : driver 
software recieving devise support 16-bit fast . 
speed : burst . 
32-bit : also know wide fast . 
8-bit 
require : driver software , wide port , recieving 
device also 32-bit mode chip . 
expect 
. 
speed : burst 
say simple . 
seven version seperate software , 
chip , port . 
software drop 
five version scsi seperate hardware chip port
