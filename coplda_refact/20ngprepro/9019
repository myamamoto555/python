hard remember , buy new ' 78 . 

3rd place '78 speed war behind cbx & xs eleven 
11.8 @ mile , 75 horse . 
would even make good 600 
day . 
, pay $ 2800 , technology 
thing change . 
course would still rather ride old g 
across three state 600 's . 
guess indication much thing change 12 
second 400 seem far line .
