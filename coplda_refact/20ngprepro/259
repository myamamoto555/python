review 
high school english teacher emphasize participial phrase , 
might start second amendment , follow : 
97th congress , 2nd session , committee print , right keep 
bear arm , subcomittee constitution committee 
judiciary , united states senate , 97th congress , second session , 
february , 1982 . 
gpo no. 
authoritative , heavily research annotated document clearly 
turn `` interpretation '' specious claptrap , polite 
way say utter bullshit . 
spite false assertion 
contrary , second amendment protect right individual 
citizen , capacity individual , keep bear arm . 
, mr. holland , , blatantly harmfully false information , 
assert fact globally distribute , deserve globally 
distribute rebuttal forum post . 
besides , site carry .
