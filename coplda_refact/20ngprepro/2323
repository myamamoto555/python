summary : need help !!! 
one question throw guy ... 
class project , need design build power supply 
follow spec : 
: adjustable 
current : limit 1a 
voltage must stay within 2 % designate value 
ac ripple less 5 mv rm 
course , use adjustable voltage , 
regulator chip ; ^ 
problem current limit i.e. find stuff 
rest part circuit . 
supply must , 
present load would draw 1a , give 
supply voltage , reduce voltage current equal 
one amp . 
thus , short thing ammeter , 
read one amp . 
measure current 1 ohm 
resistor 12v , read one amp output voltage , 
necessity , must 1v . 
basic idea see current limiter involve 
circuit pull current base output 
power transistor , therefore reduce output . 
, anybody idea could work ? 
thanks advance . 
andy collins , 

p : anybody want flame stupid project , agree fully , 
still , grade ; ^
