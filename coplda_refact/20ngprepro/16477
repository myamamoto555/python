get software revision 1.0 rev. 3.1 . 
family sister 
father purchase dw 's see mine go 
one year unscathed stick trusty ii 's . 
original dw go 5 year moderate personal use . 
would 
say go least 15,000 sheet , around one 
small ink cartridge every 3 month . 
brother might take dw probably gon na give 
, look upgrade color dw . 
chief 
find year : 
advantage : quick 2-3 ppm , quiet sleep 
printing , appletalk unfortunately original , 
look buy use . 
rewire home 
appletalk connector , home , use dad 's one 
dw ! 
, cheap run ~ $ 300 . 
btw , upgrade older dw 's 
color appletalk , dunno hp still upgrade , 
receive many offer ned however . 
also , crisp 
output wonder use really impress 
dot-matrix people much , charge $ 0.25 
per sheet stop college dorm neighbor bother 
hour night ... 
disadvantage . 
ink use hard find , cheap , 
originally . 
hp wonder ink 
dunno still toxic , still smear 
run run around damp boston rain , get 
bookbag completely soak . 
ink run $ 14 - $ 15 small cart 
get mine chicago , think 
$ 12 . 
ink cart use say date 6 month , 
think say anymore . 
stick 4 month supply 
3 cart . 
use cheap laser print paper 
fool long time . 
paper also good . 
smear 
happen , unless brand new ink cart grab 
paper smudge soon come machine . 
disadvantage : postscript advantage 
speed , usually . 
ways around ghostscript freedom press 
software solution . 
bet hp probably ps prototype inkjet , 
release fear hurt lj sale . 
end , primary advantage laser true postscript 
unless go cheap laser , fuse toner smearing , even 
soak water . 
laser slightly sharper , 
instance need precise layout printed circuit board 
transparencies . 
find color phaser 
postscript thermal wax transfer work best make pcb 
negative directly onto transparency . 
well , hope babbling help .
