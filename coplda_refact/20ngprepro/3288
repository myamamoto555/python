'll agree generally hold `` good thing '' , 
question whether come close objective value . 
especially consider one time another 
view undesirable . 
doubt could even come 
anything could say universally `` good '' `` bad '' . 
refer `` truth '' use term 
hypothetically , realize full well may even 
thing .

certainly one one 's moral belief compromise 
good . 
compromise absolute truth something 
people successfully . 
suppose one could hold compromise 
absolute moral , happen someone else 
insist compromise ?

look way say

almost invariably consider relative value one thing 
another , moral consequence , people consider 
aspect justify desire action belief . 
justify 
peace might argue let people live long & 
healthy peaceful life . 
much may well true , 
incomplete ignore benefit war - kill 
agressive member society , trim population , stimulate 
production . 
equation always complex present . 
characterize relative moral merely follow one 's 
conscience desire unduly simplify .
