well , agree viola better signing . 
however , 
everyone say want lefthanded starter ? 
understand lefthand 
spot reliever , even though usually face righthanded batter 
lefthanded batter . 
understand people insist 
lefthanded starter , unless park effect e.g. , yankee stadium . 
batter mlb righthanded , righthanded starter 
platoon advantage often lefthanded starter . 
guess one argument lefty starter certain team 
may vulnerable lhp 's rhp 's . 
however , probably 
factor postseason , team seldom juggle starter 
reason regular season . 
think want best starter get , regardless 
whether lefty righty . 
lefthand starter tend 
higher era 's righthanded starter , precisely manager 
go way start inferior lefty perhaps 
platoon advantage . 
miss something ?
