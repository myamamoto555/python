well , let see . 
uzi , . 
m-11 9 , . 
m-16 ar-15 , maybe . 
remember 
selector ar-15 . 
remember correctly please correct 
wrong switch would set `` '' position `` '' position 
gun ar-15 semi-automatic . 
would m-16 position 
semi-auto fire full-auto fire maybe 3 round burst ? 

correct would easy distinguish gun alone ? 
course 
ar-15 modify full-auto fire would think would 
easy talk distinguish unmodified ar-15 m-16 . 
gun ? 
also selector switch switch 
semi-auto fire ?
