hate pour cold water , currently seawater extract 
uranium , even use new , improved fiber absorber japan , 
20 time expensive uranium spot market . 
uranium cheap right , around $ . 
right , 
mine close compete place like cigar 
lake canada ore rich present safety hazard 
mine , work shield vehicle . 
plenty source 
example , uranium phosphate processing would come line 
uranium reach $ . 
`` demand supply balance collapse '' nonsense . 
supply 
demand always balance ; change price . 
uranium go 
increase price factor 20 end century ? 
bloody likely . 
new nuclear reactor build 
sufficient rate . 
uranium seawater interesting , long term project , 
project japanese might justify grounds 
self-sufficiency .
