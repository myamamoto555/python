introduction atheism 
mathew < > 
article attempt provide general introduction atheism . 
whilst 
try neutral possible regard contentious issue , 
always remember document represent one viewpoint . 

would encourage read widely draw conclusion ; 
relevant book list companion article . 
provide sense cohesion progression , present article 
imaginary conversation atheist theist . 

question ask imaginary theist question crop 
repeatedly since newsgroup create . 

frequently ask question answer companion article . 
please note article arguably slant towards answer question 
pose christian viewpoint . 
faq file reflect 
question actually ask , predominantly christian 
proselytize . 
talk religion , talk primarily religion 
christianity , judaism islam , involve sort superhuman divine 
. 
much discussion apply religion , 
may . 
`` atheism ? '' 
atheism characterize absence belief existence god . 
atheist go , believe god exist . 
former 
often refer `` weak atheist '' position , latter `` strong 
atheism '' . 
important note difference two position . 
`` weak 
atheism '' simple scepticism ; disbelief existence god . 
`` strong 
atheism '' positive belief god exist . 
please 
fall trap assume atheist `` strong atheist '' . 
atheist believe non-existence god ; limit 
atheism specific god , christian god , rather make 
flat-out denial . 
`` disbelieve god thing believe exist ? '' 
definitely . 
disbelief proposition mean one believe 
true . 
believe something true equivalent 
believe false ; one may simply idea whether true 
. 
bring agnosticism . 
`` agnosticism ? '' 
term ` agnosticism ' coin professor huxley meeting 
metaphysical society 1876 . 
define agnostic someone 
disclaim `` strong '' atheism believe ultimate origin thing 
must cause unknown unknowable . 
thus agnostic someone believe know 
sure whether god exist . 
word slippery thing , language inexact . 
beware assume 
work someone 's philosophical point view simply fact 
call atheist agnostic . 
example , many people 
use agnosticism mean `` weak atheism '' , use word `` atheism '' 
refer `` strong atheism '' . 
beware also word `` atheist '' many shades meaning , 
difficult generalize atheist . 
say 
sure atheist believe god . 
example , certainly 
case atheist believe science best way find 
universe . 
`` philosophical justification basis atheism ? '' 
many philosophical justification atheism . 
find 
particular person choose atheist , best ask . 
many atheist feel idea god present major religion 
essentially self-contradictory , logically impossible 
god could exist . 
atheist scepticism , 
see evidence god exist . 
`` impossible prove non-existence something ? '' 
many counter-example statement . 
example , 
quite simple prove exist prime number larger 
prime number . 
course , deal well-defined object 
obey well-defined rule . 
whether god universe similarly 
well-defined matter debate . 
however , assume moment existence god provably 
impossible , still subtle reason assume non-existence 
god . 
assume something exist , always possible 
show assumption invalid find single counter-example . 
hand assume something exist , thing 
question provably impossible , show assumption invalid 
may require exhaustive search possible place thing 
might find , show . 
exhaustive search 
often impractical impossible . 
problem largest 
prime , prove exist . 
therefore generally accept must assume thing exist 
unless evidence . 
even theist follow rule 
time ; believe unicorn , even though conclusively 
prove unicorn exist anywhere . 
assume god exist make assumption probably 
test . 
make exhaustive search everywhere god might 
prove exist anywhere . 
sceptical atheist assume 
default god exist , since assumption test . 
profess strong atheism usually claim sort god 
exist ; instead , generally restrict claim cover 
variety god describe follower various religion . 
whilst 
may impossible prove conclusively god exist , may 
possible prove say god describe particular religious 
book exist . 
may even possible prove god describe 
present-day religion exist . 
practice , believe god describe religion exist 
close believe god exist . 
however , sufficiently different 
counter-argument base impossibility disprove every kind 
god really applicable . 
`` god essentially ? '' 
god interact universe way , effect interaction 
must measurable . 
hence interaction universe must 
detectable . 
god essentially , must therefore case 
interact universe way . 
many atheist would argue 
god interact universe , 
importance whether exist . 
bible believe , god easily detectable israelites . 
surely still detectable today ? 
note demand god interact scientifically 
verifiable , physical way . 
must surely possible perceive 
effect cause presence , though ; otherwise , distinguish 
thing exist ? 
`` ok , may think philosophical justification atheism , 
still religious belief ? '' 
one common pastime philosophical discussion `` 
redefinition game '' . 
cynical view game follow : 
person begin make contentious statement . 
person b point 
true , person gradually word use 
statement arrive something person b prepare accept . 

record statement , along fact person b agree 
, continue . 
eventually use statement `` agree fact '' , 
use original definition word rather obscure 
redefinition originally need get b agree . 
rather see 
apparently inconsistent , b tend play along . 
point digression answer question `` 
atheism religious belief ? '' 
depend crucially upon mean 
`` religious '' . 
`` religion '' generally characterize belief superhuman 
control power -- especially sort god -- faith 
worship . 
worth point pass variety buddhism 
`` religion '' accord definition . 
atheism certainly belief sort superhuman power , 
categorize worship meaningful sense . 
widen definition 
`` religious '' encompass atheism tend result many aspect 
human behavior suddenly become class `` religious '' well -- 
science , politics , watch tv . 
`` ok , religion . 
surely belief atheism science 
still act faith , like religion ? '' 
firstly , entirely clear sceptical atheism something one 
actually believe . 
secondly , necessary adopt number core belief assumption 
make sort sense sensory datum experience . 
atheist 
try adopt core belief possible ; even subject 
question experience throw doubt . 
science number core assumption . 
example , generally 
assume law physics observer . 

sort core assumption atheist make . 
basic idea call 
`` act faith '' , almost everything know must say base 
act faith , term lose meaning . 
faith often use refer complete , certain belief something . 
accord definition , atheism science certainly act 
faith . 
course , individual atheist scientist dogmatic 
religious follower claim something `` certain '' . 

general tendency , however ; many atheist would reluctant 
state certainty universe exist . 
faith also use refer belief without support evidence proof . 
sceptical atheism certainly fit definition , sceptical atheism 
belief . 
strong atheism closer , still really match , 
even dogmatic atheist tend refer experimental datum 
lack assert god exist . 
`` atheism religious , surely anti-religious ? '' 
unfortunate human tendency label everyone either `` '' 
`` '' , `` friend '' `` enemy '' . 
truth clear-cut . 
atheism position run logically counter theism ; sense , 
say `` '' . 
however , religious believer 
speak atheist `` anti-religious '' usually mean atheist 
sort antipathy hatred towards theist . 
categorization atheist hostile towards religion quite unfair . 
atheist attitude towards theist fact cover broad spectrum . 
atheist take `` live let live '' attitude . 
unless question , 
usually mention atheism , except perhaps close friend . 

course , may part atheism `` socially acceptable '' 
many country . 
atheist quite anti-religious , may even try `` convert '' 
possible . 
historically , anti-religious atheist make little 
impact society outside eastern bloc country . 
digress slightly : soviet union originally dedicate separation 
church state , like usa . 
soviet citizen legally free 
worship wish . 
institution `` state atheism '' come 
stalin take control soviet union try destroy church 
order gain complete power population . 
atheist quite vocal belief , see 
religion encroach matter business -- example , 
government usa . 
individual usually concern 
church state remain separate . 
`` allow religion say running state , 
surely state atheism ? '' 
principle separation church state state shall 
legislate concern matter religious belief . 
particular , 
mean state promote one religion expense 
another , also promote belief religious 
nature . 
religion still say discussion purely secular matter . 

example , religious believer historically responsible 
encourage many political reform . 
even today , many organization 
campaigning increase spending foreign aid found 
religious campaign . 
long campaign concern secular matter , 
long discriminate religious grounds , atheist 
quite happy see say . 
`` prayer school ? 
god , care people 
pray ? '' 
people pray voter lawmaker , tend thing 
pray ignore . 
also , christian prayer 
school intimidate non-christian , even tell 
need join . 
diversity religious non-religious belief mean 
impossible formulate meaningful prayer 
acceptable present public event . 
also , tend friend family pray . 
reasonable 
care friend family waste time , even without 
motive . 
`` mention christian campaign increase foreign aid . 

atheist ? 
atheist charity hospital ? 

atheist object religious charity ? '' 
many charity without religious purpose atheist 
contribute . 
atheist contribute religious charity well , 
sake practical good . 
atheist even voluntary work 
charity found theistic basis . 
atheist seem feel atheism worth shout 
connection charity . 
, atheism simple , obvious everyday 
matter , charity . 
many feel somewhat cheap , say 
self-righteous , use simple charity excuse plug particular set 
religious belief . 
`` weak '' atheist , build hospital say `` believe god '' 
rather strange idea ; rather like hold party say `` today 
birthday '' . 
fuss ? 
atheism rarely evangelical . 
`` say atheism anti-religious . 
perhaps backlash 
one 's upbringing , way rebel ? '' 
perhaps , . 
many people parent attempt 
force religious atheist idea upon , many people 
choose call atheist . 
also doubtless case religious people choose religion 
backlash atheist upbringing , way different . 

hand , many people choose religion way conform 
expectation . 
whole , conclude much whether atheism religion 
backlash conformism ; although general , people tendency go 
along group rather act think independently . 
`` atheist differ religious people ? '' 
believe god . 
. 
atheist may listen heavy metal -- backwards , even -- may prefer 
verdi requiem , even know word . 
may wear hawaiian shirt , 
may dress black , may even wear orange robe . 
many 
buddhists lack belief sort god . 
atheist even carry copy 
bible around -- argue , course ! 
whoever , chance meet several atheist without 
realize . 
atheist usually unexceptional behavior 
appearance . 
`` unexceptional ? 
atheist less moral religious people ? '' 
depend . 
define morality obedience god , course 
atheist less moral obey god . 
usually one 
talk morality , one talk acceptable `` right '' unacceptable 
`` wrong '' behavior within society . 
human social animal , maximally successful must 
co-operate . 
good enough reason discourage 
atheist `` anti-social '' `` immoral '' behavior , purely purpose 
self-preservation . 
many atheist behave `` moral '' `` compassionate '' way simply 
feel natural tendency empathize human . 
care 
happen ? 
know , simply way . 
naturally , people behave `` immorally '' try use 
atheism justify action . 
however , equally many people 
behave `` immorally '' try use religious belief justify 
action . 
example : 
`` trustworthy say deserve full acceptance : jesus christ 
come world save sinner ... reason , 
show mercy ... jesus christ might display unlimited 
patience example would believe receive 
eternal life . 
king eternal , immortal , invisible , god , 
honor glory forever ever . '' 
quote statement make court february 17th 1992 
jeffrey dahmer , notorious cannibal serial killer milwaukee , 
wisconsin . 
seem every atheist , 
religious . 
trivial morality ? 
survey conduct roper organization find behavior 
deteriorate `` bear '' experience . 
4 % respondent 
say drive intoxicate `` bear , '' 12 % 
conversion . 
similarly , 5 % use illegal drug 
conversion , 9 % . 
two percent admit engage illicit sex 
salvation ; 5 % . 
`` freethought today '' , september 1991 , p. 12 . 
seem best , religion monopoly moral 
behavior . 
`` thing atheist morality ? '' 
mean `` thing morality atheist ? '' 
, 
answer yes , explain . 
many atheist idea morality 
least strong hold religious people . 
mean `` atheism characteristic moral code ? '' 
, answer 
. 
atheism imply anything much person 
behave . 
atheist follow many `` moral rule '' theist , 
different reason . 
atheists view morality something create 
human , accord way human feel world ` ought ' work , rather 
see set rule decree supernatural . 
`` atheist theist deny god ? '' 
study freedom religion foundation find 90 % 
atheist respond become atheist religion work 
. 
find religious belief fundamentally incompatible 
observe around . 
atheist unbeliever ignorance denial ; 
unbeliever choice . 
vast majority spend time 
study one religion , sometimes great depth . 

make careful consider decision reject religious belief . 
decision may , course , inevitable consequence 
individual 's personality . 
naturally sceptical person , choice 
atheism often one make sense , hence 
choice person honestly make . 
`` atheist want believe god ? '' 
atheists live life though nobody watch . 
many 
desire watch , matter good-natured 
`` big brother '' figure might . 
atheist would like able believe god -- ? 

one believe thing merely one want true ? 
risk 
approach obvious . 
atheist often decide want 
believe something enough ; must evidence belief . 
`` course atheist see evidence existence god -- 
unwilling soul see ! '' 
many , atheist previously religious . 
explain 
, vast majority seriously consider possibility god 
exist . 
many atheist spend time prayer try reach god . 
course , true atheist lack open mind ; assume 
atheist bias insincere offensive . 
comment `` course god , look properly '' 
likely view patronize . 
certainly , wish engage philosophical debate atheist 
vital give benefit doubt assume 
sincere say search god . 

willing believe basically tell truth , debate 
futile . 
`` whole life completely pointless atheist ? '' 
many atheist live purposeful life . 
decide think give 
mean life , pursue goal . 
try make life 
count , wish eternal life , influence 
people live . 
example , atheist may dedicate life 
political reform , hope leave mark history . 
natural human tendency look `` mean '' `` purpose '' random 
event . 
however , means obvious `` life '' sort thing 
`` meaning '' . 
put another way , everything look like question actually 
sensible thing ask . 
atheist believe ask `` 
meaning life ? '' 
silly ask `` meaning cup 
coffee ? '' 
. 
believe life purpose meaning , . 
`` atheist find comfort time danger ? '' 
many way obtain comfort ; family , friend , even pet . 
less spiritual level , food drink tv . 
may sound rather empty vulnerable way face danger , 
? 
individual believe thing comforting , 
face reality matter harsh might ? 
end , decision individual concerned . 
atheist 
unable believe something would otherwise believe merely 
make feel comfortable . 
put truth comfort , consider 
search truth sometimes make feel unhappy , 
hard luck . 
`` atheist worry might suddenly show wrong ? '' 
short answer `` , ? '' 
many atheist atheist year . 
encounter many 
argument much suppose evidence existence god , 
find invalid inconclusive . 
thousand year religious belief result good proof 
existence god . 
atheist therefore tend feel unlikely 
prove wrong immediate future , stop worry . 
`` theist question belief ? 
argument 
apply ? '' 
, belief question similar . 
weak atheism 
sceptical `` default position '' take ; assert nothing . 
strong atheism 
negative belief . 
theism strong positive belief . 
atheist sometimes also argue theist question belief 
real harm cause -- believer , 
everyone else . 
`` sort harm ? '' 
religion represent huge financial work burden mankind . 

matter religious believer waste money church building ; 
think time effort spend building church , pray , . 
imagine effort could better spend . 
many theist believe miracle healing . 
plenty instance 
ill people `` heal '' priest , cease take medicine 
prescribe doctor , die result . 
theist die 
refuse blood transfusion religious grounds . 
arguable catholic church 's opposition birth control -- 
condom particular -- increase problem overpopulation many 
third-world country contribute spread aids world-wide . 
religious believer know murder child rather 
allow child become atheist marry someone different 
religion . 
`` real believer . 
claim believer 
sort excuse . '' 
make real believer ? 
many one true religion hard 
tell . 
look christianity : many compete group , 
convinced true christian . 
sometimes even fight 
kill . 
atheist suppose decide real 
christian , even major christian church like 
catholic church church england decide amongst ? 
end , atheist take pragmatic view , decide anyone 
call christian , use christian belief dogma justify 
action , consider christian . 
maybe christian 
pervert christian teaching end -- surely 
bible readily use support un-christian act 
much moral code ? 
bible word god , could 
make less easy misinterpret ? 
know belief 
perversion god intend ? 
single unambiguous interpretation bible , 
atheist take one interpretation another ? 
sorry , someone claim believe jesus murder 
jesus bible tell , must call 
christian . 
`` obviously extreme sort belief question . 
since 
nobody ever prove god exist , must unlikely 
basic religious belief , share faith , nonsense . '' 
hold , point start dialogue , 
positive assertion concern existence entity inherently much 
harder disprove negative one . 
nobody ever prove unicorn 
exist , make unlikely myth . 
therefore much valid hold negative assertion default 
hold positive assertion default . 
course , `` weak '' atheist 
would argue assert nothing better still . 
`` well , atheism 's great , many theist ? '' 
unfortunately , popularity belief little `` correct '' 
, whether `` work '' ; consider many people believe astrology , 
graphology , pseudo-science . 
many atheist feel simply human weakness want believe 
god . 
certainly many primitive human society , religion allow 
people deal phenomenon adequately understand . 
course , religion . 
industrialized world , 
find people believe religious explanation phenomenon even 
perfectly adequate natural explanation . 
religion may start 
means attempt explain world , nowadays serve 
purpose well . 
`` many culture develop religion . 
surely must say 
something ? '' 
really . 
religion superficially similar ; example , 
worth remember religion buddhism taoism lack sort 
concept god christian sense . 
course , religion quick denounce compete religion , 
rather odd use one religion try justify another . 
`` famous scientist philosopher conclude 
god exist ? '' 
every scientist philosopher believe god , one 
. 
besides , already point , truth belief 
determine many people believe . 
also , important 
realize atheist view famous scientist philosopher 
way theist view religious leader . 
famous scientist human ; may expert field , 
talk matter word carry special weight . 
many 
respected scientist make look foolish speak 
subject lie outside field expertise . 
`` really say widespread belief religion indicate 
nothing ? '' 
entirely . 
certainly indicate religion question 
property help spread far . 
theory memetic talk `` meme '' -- set idea propagate 
human mind , analogy gene . 
atheist view 
religion set particularly successful parasitic meme , spread 
encourage host convert . 
meme avoid destruction 
discourage believer question doctrine , use peer pressure 
keep one-time believer admit mistake . 

religious meme even encourage host destroy host control 
meme . 
course , memetic view particular virtue associate 
successful propagation meme . 
religion good thing 
number people believe , disease good thing 
number people catch . 
`` even religion entirely true , least put across important 
message . 
fundamental message atheism ? '' 
many important idea atheist promote . 
follow 
; surprise see idea also present 
religion . 
moral behavior mindlessly follow rule . 
especially sceptical positive claim . 
want life sort meaning , 
find . 
search true , even make uncomfortable . 
make life , probably one 'll . 
good rely external power change ; must change 
. 
something 's popular mean good . 
must assume something , assume something easy test . 
believe thing want true . 
finally importantly : 
belief open question .
