bible actually use today , 
judge ? 
people 
use scissors cut paper , consumer 's report 
test scissors ability , even though 
scissors may design originally cut cloth ? 
possibly good way judge use bible teaching 
jewish morality today , hardly seem fair claim 
version `` enlighten time '' . 
attempt extend analogy , like say 
original unusually advance 
time , even though ever cut cloth , never even 
hear paper . 
argue bible `` disgusting '' , though 
history depict , modern standard . 
however , history 
full similar abuse , think biblical account 
worse contemporary -- possibly . 
hand , 
know reason think history describe bible 
show less abuse contemporary , . 
complex 
benign moral tradition evolve base particular mythic 
interpretation history interesting , still 
think fair take long tradition interpretation use 
attack condemnation original history .
