see price sportster dramatically 
drop $ 200 price courier remain $ 400 . 

anyone knowledge modem anyone courier ? 
courier top-of-the-line product , thus higher price . 
` ve 
never take real look sportster line courier , 
gather , basically entry-level modem . 
probably 
meet specification courier . 
sure 
sportster line fully dsp drive like recent courier 
modem , upgrade future may issue . 
, take grain salt ... never evaluate 
sportster , go bit piece hear . 

want real answer , post question 'll find 
people work sportster . 
personally , though , go look courier modem , would 
buy dual standard ... would get hst v. . 
fact , 
exactly . 
sit look usr d right 
. 
, correct incorrect statement ... folk , want 
get reliable answer modem uart question , post 
. 
post group , never know ` ll 
get way answer may well get good answer ... 
may get something like one . 
least cdm , someone post 
complete utter b , 'll see flurry folk correct 
avoid spread faulty info .

lower speed , . 
absolutely nothing 
either ccitt recommendation v. 42 v. say 
operate modem run v. . 
v. , course , 
currently standardize operation top v. 42 primary 
mode operation , , far go . 
case confusion , v. .42 bi also 
support courier line unless really ancient one .

take second look original question :

^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
see v. ? 
question courier hst 
modem , courier dual standard ... courier 
v. modem . 
modem question support hst , period . 

therefore support 16.8 kb hst . 
also , courier hst courier dual standard modem support 16.8 kb 
version hst . 
dual standard support hst 14.4 kb . 

even older model run hst 9.6 kb .

hst usr 's proprietary modulation scheme ... talk 
hst , talk v. . 
v. definitely 
proprietary modulation scheme .

hst one way

hope mean two sentence relate 
way ... 
first , v. 32 v. synchronous asynchronous . 

part ccitt recommendation i.e. , part standard . 

feature unique sportster look appropriate chapter 
courier d manual . 
second , hst `` one way . '' 
correctly put , 
asymmetrical modulation scheme , mean work speed 
direction . 
hst operate 9.6 14.4 16.8 one direction , 
low-speed direction . 
high-speed 
channel go direction higher datum flow . 
fine 
log say , bb , type one letter get screen 
info back , transfer file use , etc. ... , course , 
penalty turnaround time high-speed channel need reverse 
direction . 
v. 32 v. symmetrical , mean transfer full 
datum rate direction time . 
third , synchronous vs asynchronous absolutely nothing 
symmetrical vs asymmetrical ... two completely different topic . 
> hst 's upgradeable spec available . 
, correctly put , courier line upgradeable 
whatever `` '' call complete . 
large 
footprint courier modem like , ... 
upgrade plan back upgrade small footprint variety , 
could eventually upgrade support , cost two 
upgrade together pretty much put higher buy new modem . 
later ...
