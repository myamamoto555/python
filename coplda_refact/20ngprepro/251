major view trinity 
second century 
writer 2nd cent . 
important , set much 
context later discussion . 
justin martyr , aristides , 
athenagoras , tatian , theophilus antioch know 
`` apologist '' . 
theology often describe `` logo 
theology '' . 
base strongly wording john , take less 
two-phase approach . 
eternity , logo 
father , mind thought . 
`` immanent word '' become 
`` express '' god reveal history , ultimately jesus . 
thus jesus ' full distinction father become visible 
history , though logos present god eternity . 
rusch regard view contain many emphasis 
final orthodox position , form less sophisticated , 
technical language properly deal 
eternal plurality godhead . 
irenaeus hold view somewhat similar apologists . 
however 
uncomfortable two-stage approach . 
still view god 
one personage , distinction become fully visible 
except process self-revelation `` economy '' . 

distinction present essential nature . 
irenaeus emphasize 
holy spirit apologists . 
irenaeus ' view 
probably call `` economic trinitarianism '' , though term 
normally use refer later development .

dynamic 
source : theodotus 
adherent : paul , , , modern unitarians 
perception god 's essence : unity god denote oneness nature 
oneness person . 
son holy spirit therefore 
father 's divine essence impersonal attribute . 
divine come upon man jesus , god strict 
sense word . 
perception god 's subsistence : notion god palpable 
impossibility , since perfect unity perfectly indivisible . 

` diversity ' god apparent real , since christ event 
work holy spirit attest dynamic operation within god , 
hypostatic union . 
: 
father : unique originator universe . 
eternal , , 
without begin end . 
son : virtuous finite man whose life god dynamically present 
unique way ; christ definitely deity though humanity deify . 
holy spirit : impersonal attribute godhead . 
deity 
ascribe holy spirit . 
criticism : elevate reason witness biblical revelation 
concern trinity . 
categorically deny deity christ 
holy spirit , thereby undermine theological undergirding biblical 
doctrine salvation . 
summary , probably best thought trinitarianism 
. 
god undifferentiated one . 
son holy spirit see 
simply name man jesus grace god active 
church .

rusch comment evidence belief sketchy . 

actually two slightly different group include : 
follower , sabellius .

unfortunately ,
