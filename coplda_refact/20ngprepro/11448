sound like memory conflict problem , cause truly weird symptom 
like . 
call dell tech support better , post 
account get memory range use video ram 
machine . 
block window use range 
statement section . 
probably 
include statement exclude range whatever 
memory manager use config.sys . 
dell `` install '' windows machine ship , installation 
consist much copy file hard disk . 
still 
work . 
fact problem enhance 
mode standard strongly suggest high memory conflict .
