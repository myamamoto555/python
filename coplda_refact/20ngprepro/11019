actually , advisor , another classmate mine , talk 
day put one detector one pluto satellite . 
realize satellite alone carry something like 200 
pound eq . 
well , detector need lead shield protect , 
1 alone weigh 200 pound .

think fit ... 
pluto fast flyby instrument definition research , 
instrument payload constraint : 
mass allocation - 7 kilogram 15.4 lb 
power allocation - 6 watt 
require instrument : 
visible imaging system ccd , 750 mm fl , optics 
ir mapping spectrometer hgcdte array , 0.3 % energy resolution 
uv spectrometer nm , 0.5 nm resolution 
radio science incorporate telecom system 
means 10 ^ -14 . 
leave much room payload totally unrelated 
mission spacecraft . 
addition , power come 
radioisotope thermal generator , whole space craft 
2 foot diameter , boom , mean 
strong pu-239 associate schmutz 
background , tend reduce sensitivity somewhat . 
would still nice , group goddard look 
.
