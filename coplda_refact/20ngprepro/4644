difficulty high isp otv include : 
long transfer time radiation damage belt 
spacecraft otv 
xenon thruster require huge amount power 
either nuclear power source messy , dangerous source 
radiation damage big solar array sensitive radiation , heavy 
make attitude control docking big pain . 
go solar , replace array every trip , 
current technology . 
nuclear power source strongly restricted 
international treaty . 
refueling even high isp like xenon still require 
turn pain . 
either develop autonomous rendezvous long range 
docking refuel . 
still much plane change require high ! 
air force continue look thing way though . 
suppose 
bide time till technology become available 
problem get solve . 
impossible principle , hard 
marginally cheaper one shot rocket , least today . 
random thought high isp otv 's . 
design one ...
