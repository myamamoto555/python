less logical assumption something 
_ _ bible , _ must _ . 
really 
think say anyway . 
see . 
> slavery immoral believe , assume everyone 
> else group ? 
, jesus apostle 
> speak ? 
slave common practice back . 
paul 
> speak everything else immoral . 
apparently think 
> important enough talk thing like drunkard . 

> anyone mention slavery ? 
god 's moral eternal 
> change like moral society , must immoral 
> today . 
letter philemon ? 
paul least hint 
certain slave release . 
also , slavery time 
type slavery u.s. think better 
comparison would indentured servitude . 
really want get 
discussion slavery . 
anyway , although demonstrate 
point , think relevent , original poster 
say absence specific prove something 
immoral . 
back original poster 's assertion . 
fact making 
logical error accuse . 
state fact 
bible say baby baptize . 
also , know 
bible say _ everyone _ must baptize enter heaven . 
_ everyone _ include infant , unless scripture 
contrary , i.e. exception . 
since exception list 
bible , must assume safe side bible mean 
say , _ everyone _ must baptize enter heaven . 

baptize infant . 
summarize , accuse original poster say something 
forbid bible , prove ok ; i.e. 
something disproven , true . 
rather seem 
assert since bible forbid , _ prove _ , 
use bible , _ _ ok . 
difference 
prove whether something prove disproven 
theory provability field logic , way actually 
prove disprove . 
logical error must avoid fall 
converse : something prove , 
false . 
seem error many _ solum scriptura _ believer . 
think thing prove one use 
scripture alone prove something either way infant baptism , 
although evidence seem favor .
