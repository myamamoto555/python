effect real concern conduct study new 
treatment . 
researcher try limit kind effect 
perform study `` blind '' various way . 

: 
o subject study know whether receive 
placebo test treatment , i.e. , whether 
control group test group . 
o administer treatment know subject 
receive placebo test treatment . 
o evaluate individual result know subject 
receive placebo test treatment . 
obviously , point datum analyze , one 
differentiate test group control group . 
analysis 
quasi-public : researcher describe present datum 
base verify . 
worth note biological study subject 
animal , mouse , many case skewed result 
perform study `` blind '' . 

consider important make mouse ignorant already 
, though important respects except one test , 
control test group treat alike .
