benchmark marketing dweeb cpu envy . 
ok , make 
happy , 486 faster 040 . 
bfd . 
architecture 
near end lifetime . 
especially x86 
architecture : good riddance .

point processor speed one many aspect 
computer performance . 
clock speed , processor , memory speed , cpu 
architecture , system , even application program contribute 
overall system performance . 
roughly , 68040 twice fast give clock 
speed 68030 .
