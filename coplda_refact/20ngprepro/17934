followup post let add : 
really windows windows nt user , please excuse ignorance . 
however , developer sas institute , one component 
application support ability submit sas batch job 
within interactive sas session . 
user site enter 
site-specific `` batch profile '' dataset within product , specify 
sas executable , specify site specific sas option , 
etc. . 
run time certain variable resolve , resolve file 
write external file . 
exit operating system 
run job asynchronously , return interactive session soon 
job submit . 
batch job run concurrently 
interactive session . 
currently design , internal dataset record length 80 
character . 
, run batch job , command sas 
batch mode require 80 character . 
til nt 
problem , since every job language til nt eg . 
way escape enter single 
command across multiple line via rexx language , 
standard . 
gist , since application end-user , 
within company , try develop process use native nt . 
since first post learn several third party 
company provide alternative script language nt . 
sure company license product would use alternative 
script language , develop assumption 
anything come nt . 
see another post list subject something like `` vi 
available windows ? '' 
someone say vi , make , awk , 
ksh available microsoft toolkit . 
product ? 

separate product part windows ? 
ksh would need 
could count nt site . 
one last question : hear nt remote processing capability , 
i.e. could shove batch job server machine run 
. 
native nt command rather network specific 
command , would also help improve process . 
comment 
command , would appreciate . 
thanks help ,
