hey , guy . 
absolutely correct , well way win 
battle ... lose war . 
yes , serious philosophical 
flaw hr 1276 . 
technical one , -- would like sue feds , 
lose , pay _ _ `` reasonable attorney 's fee '' ... ? 
: - 
still , one basic question : compare _ get _ hr 1276 
better , b worse ? 
one even take three guess . 
good enough show support hr 1276 , maybe change 
_ _ could one say `` reasonable first step '' ...
