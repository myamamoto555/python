believe two : 15-day 60-day . 
remember 
30-day , rather 21-day . 
anyways , go . 
period length 
minimum , maximum . 
keep guy 15-day long 
want , still certify injure . 
player must 
periodically re-evaluate determine still injure thus 
park player dl maybe option 
wish expose waiver . 
get someone qualify 60-day 
reduce frequency re-evaluation . 
longer , 
believe , limit number player place dl . 

, often choose juggle injured player 
list .
