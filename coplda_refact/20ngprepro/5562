suggestion : 
take set give pulse every sec ten 
sec either rc clock input . 
feed clock 
input decode output sec output , might add ` ' 
gate decoder chip get output reset pulse back ' 521 restart 
cycle ... trigger oneshot decode edge ; one shot 
go mosfet drive mechanism fire pellet launcher . 
. 
require current , 5 - 15 volt , 12 volt 
gel cell would last six week . 
take board & battery wrap 3 '' 4 '' foam build box 
stuff ... plywood metal exterior ... 
build small heater 10-50 watt resistor series keep battery 
warm . 
2nd think use 2 battery one heater one timer pellet trigger . 
... . 
. 
even though chip state - al 
rate device good -55 c. . 
battery considerable reduction 
capacity ... oh make sure area inside minium air leakage . 
. 
hope help 
rw long winded net ?? 
gentle ...
