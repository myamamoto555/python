write x server equipment . 

hardware `` '' yuv space ; x term 24-bit 
static color visual . 
would really like server 
present static visual , sure 
acceptable `` '' x client . 
three problem see : 
1 , though huge , static . 
2 pixel would 3 byte wide . 
3 hardware actually live yuv space , 
translation rgb - > yuv introduce round error . 
server guy client guy , ask : 
limitation thwart many x client ? 
x stuff 
float around blithely accept give ? 
could write 
server also present visual , e.g. , 8 bit , 
would rather avoid necessary .

opinion suggestion .
