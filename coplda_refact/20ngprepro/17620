sorry , put foot mouth , concern church 's history . 
correct say council hippo 393 list 
deuterocanonical book among accept use 
church , ratify council carthage , 
pope gelasius 414 ad . 
yet 's history church say : 
`` end fourth century view still differ regard 
extent canon , number book 
acknowledge divine authoritative . 
jewish canon , hebrew bible , universally 
receive , apocrypha add greek version 
septuagint general way account book 
suitable church reading , thus middle class 
canonical strictly apocryphal pseudonymous writings . 
justly ; book , great historical 
value , fill gap old testament new , 
originate cessation prophecy , 
therefore regard inspire , ever cite 
christ . '' 
`` western church canon testament close 
end fourth century authority 
jerome waver , however , critical doubt 
principle tradition , especially augustine , 
firmly follow alexandrian canon septuagint , 
preponderant tradition reference catholic 
epistle revelation ; though , 
place , incline consider old testament apocrypha 
canonical , bear subordinate authority . '' 
history go say augustine attend 
council hippo carthage . 
interesting note , however , follow footnote 
fourth session council trent . 
footnote 
list various synod endorse list canonical 
book , say `` tridentine list decree 
first infallible effectually promulgate declaration 
canon holy scriptures . '' 
lead one think rc canon official 
trent . 
thus previous erroneous statement 
entirely groundless . 
also interesting note council trent 
go uphold `` old latin vulgate edition '' 
scriptures authentic . 
, would suppose , 
today 's catholic scholar wish council never say . 
also council make distinction 
canonical book -- contrast 's statement 
fourth century view .
