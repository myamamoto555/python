. 
simple $ 25 style ide controller use dma . 
cpu perform 
datum transfer string move instruction . 
require 
cpu stop transfer datum . 
smart drive 
controller , ide scsi , transfer via dma . 
controller 
tend cost wether ide scsi . 
get dma benefit , 
ide must sacrifice price advantage controller . 
example , rewind format tape , command 
issue controller bus release allow access 
device bus . 
greatly increase productivity , least , 
something else back hard drive .

floppy ide bus , arguement make sense , 
ide issue . 
floppy processor controller 
board handle command . 
difference ide scsi 
intelligent . 
controller . 
depend 
cpu fewer thing , i.e. ide drive need processor 
transfer datum . 
long story , still use ide 486 except cdrom , 
thanks scsi , move machine . 
, , scsi 
better standardized support machine , plan 
completely get rid ide .

mechanism cpu make request 
device scsi bus go business . 
later , device , issue callback say 
datum arrive function complete . 
card 
also dma datum memory without cpu , therefore 
allow continue work . 
ide support concept 
. 
see would win multitasking system ?
