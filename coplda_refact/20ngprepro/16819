often true . 
many people try place `` higher '' 
sin . 
however ...

really mistrust 
> jesus say forgive sin ? 
big part problem many homosexual people 
advocate acceptance homosexuality church consider 
active homosexuality sin . 
often see attitude 
`` forgive try change '' . 
instead see `` nothing 
wrong life good christian , must 
illness accept '' . 
christian 
accept homosexual , accept sinner . 
sure , may natural people homosexual - 
also perfectly natural everyone sin ! 
bear 
desire sin , work prevent sinning . 

much less common , still urge lash 
anger . 
also may sudden disappearance sinful 
desire ever ! 
, sad see people leave church 
discourage still homosexual 
several year .
