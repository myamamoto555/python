pete right , need worry capitalization 
rule . 
, punctuation give necessary information 
sentence structure . 
anyone worry whether 
text close original possible . 
sarcasm intend . 
> original constitution , `` militia '' , `` arm '' , etc. capitalize simply 
> noun . 
also currently german . 

> special significance word simply capitalize . 
> capitalization denote special emphasis . 
understand grumble ... , say get 
correct version constitution . 
first indicator 
something wrong i.e. copy modernize modern 
capitalization rule . 
next thing go spelling , 
even see version grammar modernize oh , 
worry , modernize grammar change meaning 
text , right ? 
... p.s. find 10 different version 
constitution network ; accuracy doe matter ...
