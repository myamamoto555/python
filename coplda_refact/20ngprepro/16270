would like see reasoning behind . 
may get 
`` burn '' natural disaster prophecy , 
mean every natural prophecy 
false . 
take quick look book jeremiah obvious 
judgement prophecy valid . 
us , seem like 
might problem positive prophecy , though 
sure may people judgement . 
sometimes god give word difficult swallow . 

relative positiveness prophecy grounds 
dismiss . 
much ot happy stuff .
