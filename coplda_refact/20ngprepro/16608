surprise , surprise ! 
true , quite whole story . 

actually people careful methodology 
also replicate ` phantom leaf effect . ' 
one influential critic kirlian 
theosophist presumably willing entertain 
hypothesis scientific evidence human aura , electromagnetic 
otherwise , professor electrical engineering london 's 
city university , past president society psychic research 
name a. j. ellison . 
year study method claim , ellison 
come conclusion photographic image 
call ` lichtenberg figure , ' effect intermittent ionization 
air around object . 
bit complicated 
` wipe plate , ' come thing 
end , kirlian much limited 
value previously widely think . 
electrical 
magnetic field generate body much small 
much use diagnostically without elaborate equipment 
usually also tracer chemical . 
kind regard ,
