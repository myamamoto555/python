lines : 41 
summarize : 
question sagacity someone say would 
`` rather spend eternity hell beside god heaven 
know even one man would spend `` eternal life '' 
scorch wrongdoing ... '' describe horrible hell 
compare statement jesus ' 
suffering cross order prevent people go hell . 
kenneth engel challenge : 
> happen jesus ? 
think , hear . 
> live one day suffering die . 
wages sin 
> paragraph , jesus pay sin , ? 
wimp admit never like metaphor 
jesus `` pay '' sin sense many christian 
accept literal . 
point god understand suffering 
go , intellectually like watch 
somalians tv , _ really _ understand , `` feel '' 
pain . 
fact manifest jesus ' life . 
argue 
someone history might suffer jesus , 
think horrible torture crucifixion , 
think case betrayal fruitless effort lead 
worse despair , main point jesus 
trench , everyone , whatever least 
humanity , whatever least 
humanity . 
, reconcile existence hell beyond 
capability , goal . 
> would surprise see moderator let one , 
thankfully moderator surprising . 
> seriously want reasonable explanation . 
re-read must admit description 
faith explanation , perhaps 
, hopefully .
