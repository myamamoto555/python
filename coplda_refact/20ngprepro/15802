suggestion ? 
experience describe like sit bike 
gear - figure chance 'll startle way 
stall bike . 
figure likely chance 
'll unable escape situation extra time 
need put bike gear . 
concentrate avoid situation rather make split-second 
evasive . 
split lane end line . 
unfortunately legal country 
split perhaps room stop near one side 
lane easy escape , leave bike gear next 
car stop . 
watch mirror mean time make sure 
! 
whether really would time move car fail 
stop , find yet . 
car annoying 
race behind brake , hard 
tell plan brake ! 
summary , position easy exit , watch 
mirror clear .
