background : orion theoretical concept . 

would drive use thermonuclear explosion drive spacecraft . 
idea would detonate device somewhere one 
ten megaton yield behind `` pusher plate '' attach main 
spacecraft . 
shock wave explosion would transfer 
momentum ship . 
, atmosphere see . 
energy explosion 
heat atmosphere , expand explosively slam shock wave 
pusher plate . 
vacuum , two thing see 
go hit plate : product barium , krypton , 
helium , neutron , evaporate bomb casing electromagnetic 
radiation gamma mostly , irradiated fission 
product . 
would work ? 
see em radiation impel much 
momentum especially give mass pusher plate , seem 
go get momentum transfer throw bomb 
back ship get detonate 
. 
must miss something . 
would someone enlighten via email ? 
thanks .
