premise wrong word `` go '' . 
claim christianity 
base blind faith , simply . 
look 
current thread evidence jesus ' resurrection evidence 
jesus real triumph death . 
furthermore , say christian hold belief `` regardless 
evidence may find contrary . '' 
without evidence 
support claim , statement little ad hominem 
argument . 
mind , mean personal attack . 
merely point 
intellectual dishonesty behind condemn christianity fashion . 
would make much sense could prove christian 
base belief empty nothing , ignore evidence 
contrary . 
expect attack make sense .
