callback reliable , find 100 % reliable , even 
system 4.1 . 
continuous background sound 
interrupt sound effect system 6.0 
documentation . 
probably cancel callback command 
channel , course get call . 
general , 
problem sound work play one per 
channel close channel related 
slowdown , play one 
work , add one synthesizer 
channel , possibly one multiple time . 
might 
call channel 
sound resource add sample sound synthesizer 
channel first thing play . 
sample sound 
command start . 
need 
sound remove command , create 
channel , specify sample sound synthesizer 
channel 's synth . 
use 's 
want . 
'll probably want switch 's , since 
go use anyway add callback . 
go ahead tell full , 
sound manager work game , remember , spectre use 
. 
work great . 
spectre spare cpu time , 
. 
one little disclaimer : say 
sound manager make work right . 

sure either way , know sure make 
sound work 100 % correctly every machine use 
sound manager .
