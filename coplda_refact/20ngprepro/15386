ok , let see get concisely . 

information gathering venture regard various expression 
. 
husband come different , completely 
christian background . 
lutheran meet 
bear raise church christ member . 
first agree lot 
c c , want move liturgical 
base lutheran church something little biblical base . 
however last year , regret change 
church christ number reason - one thing 
fundamentalist believe thing bible 
socio-cultural nature relate christian doctrine . 
one sorest spot role woman . 
believe 
mary woman , chris validate woman worthy disciple - 
c c writings paul take without exception 
tell equal partner marriage lesser 
member , submit husband thing hear 
verse one time ... take active role 
anything might construe put authority man 
ie lead prayer , conduct bible study etc . 
last straw 
elders church come one college 
group all-women want man lead 
study . 
also husband really resent way everyone church 
feel conservative republican - real 
christian get tell nobody vote clinton call 
christian . 
hence subject service 
long prayer call thing flatly dont agree . 

also agree c c 's dread new `` movement '' 
lead young people . 
, church hunting success . 
want reasonably 
biblical base church woman view whole people matter 
calling c c really look career woman . 
christopher look church deeply rooted religious 
conviction , adult baptism church member still 
bring bible service . 
confuse drift around try find 
place feel loved express faith honestly 
without reservation . 
anyone point direction would 
thrill ! 
afraid hard go back c c 
even harder stay long . 
response would welcome 
diel family 
would think somewhere baptist spectrum might find 
look . 
however issue probably one 
flavor specific local church area 
denomination -- baptist cover quite spectrum . 
adult baptism sort 
narrow choice liberal end spectrum . 
historically associate movement 
character try avoid .
