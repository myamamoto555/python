would differently ?

'll accept second assumption sake argument . 

view primary remain flaw encryption algorithm 
secret , lead suspicion back door . 
without complete 
disclosure suspicion dispel , matter many trust 
expert allow look isolation . 
possible whole thing public algorithm ? 

concern see make skipjack public someone could build 
without register key . 
assume f really keep 
secret government assume . 
part initial connection , 
execute protocol demonstrate 
know f. example , initiate phone pick number q 
send e q ; f . 
receiver send back e q +1 ; f , initiator 
send back e q +2 ; f demonstrate first packet 
random 64-bit block . 
repeat opposite direction another q 
defeat somebody building library sequential 
number remember response use response initial 
number subsequent challenge . 
way talk 
. 
course pseudo company build 
proprietary skipjack phone , presidential fact sheet imply 
get approval without equivalent key escrow . 
wrong picture ? 
depend f staying secret 
skipjack resistant cryptanalysis , government appear 
believe . 
even particular q&a suggest 
flaw , imagine protocol .

agreed . 
view , quote : worth , 
worth well .
