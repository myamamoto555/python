uh , bob , battery warmer ground temperature ? 
time 
scale question , considerably reduce temperature swing 
several foot underground , go major temperature 
difference battery sit . 
> ... question - concrete floor feel cooler 
> surround dirt place hand ? 
temperature hand , unlike battery , 
determine balance internal heat production external 
heat loss . 
feel greater rate heat loss object 
hand keep much warmer surroundings . 
case 
object significant internal heat production , 
affect quickly come equilibrium surroundings 
start equilibrium affect final 
temperature . 
reason , windchill affect whether freeze 
whether water freeze .
