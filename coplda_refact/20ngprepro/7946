lunar model one 

david h. mitchell 
march 23 , 1993 
introduction : 
order increase public interest space-based lunar operation , 
real miniature environment construct test 
model . 
model individual 
located world-wide use personal computer , edutainment 
purpose . 
provide test-bed simple 
activity also provide sharing 
information 
method operating space , include , limit , layout 

lunar colony , machine work play , disseminate 
educational information , provide contest award creativity 
achievement provide new way student worldwide participate 
twenty-first century remote learning method . 
nature project , people age , interest 

skill contribute scenery mural , model structure , 
interface 
electronics , software graphic . 
operation evolve 
playground laboratory use child , student 
professional worldwide . 
use personal computer home terminal 
participate institution user able real model 

base experimental recreational purpose . 
real 
facility 
exist , ample opportunity provide media coverage 
construction 
lunar model , operation new feature add suggest 
user . 
broad inherent interest wide range group : 
- virtual reality research 
- radio control , model railroad ham radio operation 
- astronomy space planetarium science center 
- art theater 
- bb online network user 
- software game developer 
- manufacturer retailer model rocket , car train 
- child 
- child 
overall design : 
room 14 foot 8 foot contain base lunar layout . 
wall use 
mural distant moon mountain , star field view earth . 
`` floor '' simulated lunar surface . 
global call contribution 
hereby make material lunar surface , design 
creation scale model lunar colony element , scenery , 
. 
initial design 3 : 
1 . 
ssto scale model able lift , hover land ; 
2 . 
able move quarry area ; 
3 . 
traverse simulated lunar surface . 
small tv camera utilize ccd tv chip mount 
. 
personal computer digitize image include reduce picture 
content allow minimal image send 
operator control purpose also return control signal . 
first set since model train 
tv camera build almost off-the-shelf item control 
electronics start stop train minimal . 
user 
receive image every 1 4 seconds depend speed 
datum link . 
next , ssto scale model ccd tv chip suspend 
operate wire frame mount ceiling allow 
ssto 
control operator take , hover entire lunar 
landscape land . 
finally , tank model modify ccd tv chip equip 
. 
entire initial allow remote operator 
worldwide 
receive minimal image actually operate model landing 
takeoff , travel work . 
entire system base 
commercially 
available item part easily obtain except 
interface electronics well within capability many advance 
ham radio operator computer developer . 
take graphically orient communication program add 
screen control , necessary user interface 
provide 80 man hour . 
plan action : 
virtual reality network agree sponsor project 
provide host computer network internet access network . 
provide 14 foot 8 foot facility actual construction 
lunar model . 
, stock , electronic tank 
modify one ccd tv chip . 
also agree provide `` rail stock '' 
lunar train model . 
make available graphical 
communication package modify control . 
initial `` ground breaking '' miniature shovel perform 
live news conference april 30 , 1993 . 
initial 
model put place . 
time-lapse record start 
historical purpose . 
expect event completely 
serious solemn . 
lunar colony declare open additional 
building , operation experiment . 
photographer present 
photograph take convert . 
gif image distribution 
world-wide major online network bb 's . 
press release 
issue 
call contribution idea , time , talent , material scale 
model 
simulated lunar colony . 
contest new design technique work moon 

announce . 
university invite participate , goal 
find instructor wish class participation various aspect 
lunar colony model . 
field trip arrange 
time 
result class work add model . 
contributor 
able contribute return 

campus . 
monthly newsletter issue electronically online via 
conventional means media . 
major new equipment 
addition mark invitation television news media . 
large , real model space colony attractive photo 
opportunity television community . 
especially since `` action '' 

control people world . 
science fiction writer 
invite issue `` challenge '' engineering human factor student 
university build operate equipment perform 
lunar task . 
use pulley system , gravity may 
simulated extent try various traction challenge . 
long term goal create world-wide interest , education , 
experimentation 
remote operation lunar colony . 
potential 
long 
term global edutainment method space activity may generic 
example teach explore many subject area limit 
space edutainment . 
facilitate kind spirit 
lead generation people ready leap star ! 
conclusion : 
edutainment blending education entertainment . 
anyone 
ever enjoy see miniature probably see potential impact 
globally available layout recreation , education experimentation 
purpose . 
create model lunar colony create 
world-wide publicity , also method try new idea require 
real 
virtual skill open new method put people 's mind 
space . 
: 
`` illuminating path knowledge space lunar development . '' 
follow people already engage various part work : 
, , dash , hyson , , vril , wyatt , dark one , , 
mad hatter , sir robin , . 
come join discussion friday night 10:30 midnight pst 
virtual reality network . 
idea welcome !
