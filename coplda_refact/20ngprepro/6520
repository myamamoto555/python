think difficult problem . 
start , line 
polygon set contain uncountable number 
point . 
off-the-cuff idea . 
first , need check line polygon separate . 
, 
jordan curve separation theorem say polygon divide plane 
exactly two open thus non-compact region . 
thus , line lie 
completely inside polygon , line lie completely outside polygon , 
possibly rarely happen line intersect . 
, phrasing question say `` line intersect polygon '' , 
decision problem . 
one possibility decision model approach 
reduce question well know problem q , try 
solve q. answer q give answer original decision problem . 
recent year , many geometric problem successfully model 
new language call postscript . 
see `` postscript language '' , adobe systems 
incorporate , isbn # , co. 1985 . 
, give line l polygon p , write postscript program 
draw line l polygon p , `` output '' answer . 

`` output '' , mean program execute command call `` '' , 
actually print page paper contain line polygon . 
quick 
examination paper provide answer reduce problem q , thus 
original problem . 
two small problem approach . 
1 infinite number way encode l p 
reduce problem q. , force invoke axiom 
choice equivalently , zorn 's lemma . 
use axiom 
choice regard serious light day . 
2 importantly , question arise whether 
postscript program q actually output piece paper ; 
word , halt ? 
, postscript expressive enough encode everything 
ture machine might ; thus halt problem postscript 
undecidable . 
quite possible original problem turn 
undecidable . 
even begin go difficulty , aliasing , finite 
precision run ink , paper . 
couple reference might :

summary : overkill . 
organization : at&t bell laboratories , murray hill nj 
situation nearly bleak suggest know 
better , hang around labs long enough . 
well know 
reduction see j. & d. dobbin , j. comp . 
. 
37 , ii : pp. , lemma 17 intersection reduce 
hamiltonian circuit , without ! 
use basis , coin 
acronym probably np-complete . 
besides , 
longer problem deliver , since able 
complete infinite loop 4 millisecond .

well , sure worse np-complete , restrict 
case line satisfy lipschitz condition 
second derivative .
