, `` gunshot wound '' actually cause magazine 
> go . 
first , unless round chamber little threat 
penetration bullet , brass matter . 
unless 
expand gas hold enclosed space get nice `` pop '' 
enough threat even firefighter worry . 
finally , 
rather simple tell person shoot prior burn 
crisp . 
see , time ammunition go people 
quite dead . 
look blood around wound , particularly bruise . 
however , contention make little difference 
whether die explode ammunition fire ; feds seem 
share responsibility .
