get scsi ide work together , 
restriction least adaptec 1542 : 
must boot ide drive . 
way boot 
drive ide drive . 
must disable scsi rom bio sure , though , 
must also use special driver access 
drive . 
hmm . 
know disable something related 
scsi bios , sure rom .

application , ide controller 
generally comparable throughput . 
might get slightly higher 
throughput scsi disk , 'll also pay disk 
$ 30 - $ 100 , case . 
'll also pay much , much 
good controller . 
note good controller really show power ` re 
use good multitasking operating system like pc unix . 
unfortunately , neither windows 3.1 good multitasking 
operate system . 
performance advantage scsi controller 
mostly waste , leave advantage able 
connect multiple device scsi bus advantage . 
however , note expect pay premium scsi device . 
go use , stick ide . 

cheaper , 'll less headache .

note : follow true . 
know 
future hold windows nt unix ??? 
. 
generally , find driver device , 
probably exist unless use one `` better '' `` high 
performance '' controller . 
typically 
controller cost around $ 180 - $ 400 street price , 
driver allow connect controller popular 
name-brand device either come card , purchase 
$ 100 list price . 
example driver kit : 
adaptec 's ez scsi kit list : $ 75 . 
work adaptec scsi 
controller . 
! 
people make coreldraw ! 
list : $ 99 ? 
. 
driver kit supposedly work controller card 
driver , like adaptec . 
central point 's pc tool dos 8.0 support number scsi tape 
drive documentation list 40 tape drive . 
unfortunately , 
work adaptec controller .

yes , run problem , use 
high-performance , controller . 
sound 
right , ? 
true , though . 
one controller , 
'll probably tweak system get work sound 
card , tape drive like cms jumbo 250 , 
windows 3.1 . 
know . 
h ll back get 
controller work various thank god tape 
backup . 
want copy `` adaptec 1542 hint tip '' file , 
send email . 
problem really fault scsi controller card ; 
problem really general hardware software design 
pc e.g. , standard . 
however , add scsi card 
bring problem surface make visible . 
scsi hold lot promise , run lot pc 
compatibility problem . 
plan use 
3.1 , stick ide . 
want use windows nt pc unix , ` ll 
make hard decision : good controller 
one scsi hard disk probably give excellent performance , 
possible cost compatibility . 
say , `` probably '' , , 
know true pc unix , know really 
true windows nt . 
suspect , know 
sure .
