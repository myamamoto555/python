would depend requirement poster 's datum , 
purpose resolution without calibration curve . 
otherwise possibility would : 
1 get digital serial output & connect serial 
port mac , collect datum communication program . 
2 buy chip analog device , , etc , connect 
parallel serial converter , use serial port acquisition 
nah . 
much soldering trouble shooting : - 
3 get board national instruments , data translation , omega , 
etal . 
finest solution , possibly costly . 
original poster : signal large , 
use voltage divider ? 
two resistor , cost cheap ...
