attempt animation pov create two little 
program . 
one c program perform `` morph '' 
two point give amount frame morph . 

write point , function translate , rotate , etc. 
file . 
perl script read list function 
insert . 
pov file give line . 
hope would 
let simple animation . 
however , discover simply 
perform incremental rotation object spin stationary 
object actually rotate object axis . 
know 
easy way around would first translate object 
origin perform rotation move back know 
must another way around . 
think perhaps 
create object origin translate new 
point rotation , could cause behavior . 
however 
occur object translate . 
help 
appreciate .
