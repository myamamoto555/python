hi janet , 
sound exactly like mine . 
circumstance , onset symptom , 
uselessness , duration . 
fact , people 
know migraine , none similar . 

wide variation people respect cause 
headache , generally bother share learn 
mine , since seem alike , observation . 
think heat , per se winter summer . 
dehydration could conceivably figure , though . 
try tank 
play rather . 
shape seem help much , either . 
identify four factor make difference list 
descend order importance : 
1 heavy exercise 
2 sleep deprivation 
3 fasting e.g. , skip breakfast 
4 physical trauma e.g. , head bonk 
heavy exercise precede migraine , 
get migraine every heavy exercise session . 
one 
factor must present usually # 2 . 
since discover 
, nearly -- relapse every two 
three year get cocky `` long , maybe 
get anymore '' stop careful . 
hope helpful . 
john .
