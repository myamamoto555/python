would like opinion netter subject bother 
wife lately : liturgy , particular , catholic liturgy . 
last 
year seem ad hoc event mass. . 

drive crazy ! 
aspect liturgical tradition 
happen something _ _ together , know 
. 
lead priest , course , make kind dialogue 
present god . 
best mass participatory prayer . 
lately , think proportion participation fall , proportion 
sit watch , listen , generally tell 
necessary one know happen next grow . 
example . 
last sunday palm sunday go local church . 
usually 
palm sunday , congregation participate read passion , take 
role mob . 
theology behind seem profound -- say 
`` crucify '' mean . 
, come back today would 
. 
always give chill . 
last week `` invite '' sit 
gospel passion _ listen _ . 
besides orwellian `` invitation '' , 
really sadden little role take away . 
seem 
typical shift participation away people , toward 
musician , reader , . 
new thing introduce course 
liturgy since one know happen , new thing 
explain , pretty soon instead _ _ lot mass 
sit listen spacing , case mass 
. 
mind , lay blame liturgy committee make lay 
`` expert '' , may . 
think liturgy committee 
bias toward something rather nothing -- fact 
bureaucratic life -- even though simpler liturgy may fact make easier 
people aware lord 's presence . 
wonder -- oddball , quality mass 
go ? 
mean facetiously . 
go mass every thursday 
friday remind power simple liturgy make aware 
god 's presence . 
far obligatory sunday masses ... maybe 
offer anyone else noticed decline congregational 
participation catholic mass lately ?
