two question well probably ... expose & configure 
event handle . 
appl . 
use 1 window draw . 
since give user 
capability scaling zoom well allow window 
resize , make translation table expose & configure event . 
expose event call redraw method configure event 
call method . 
method invoke `` fake '' expose 
event actually call redraw w appropriate expose struct 
draw datum . 
quest 1 .
