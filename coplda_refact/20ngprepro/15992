run derivative os , obviously . 
please take note 
follow exactly happen , slightly simplify 
explanation . 
technically , irq line means device printer 
adapter , soundblaster , modem , hard disk , ... signal cpu 
`` something 's happen , please take note . '' 
cpu 
program handle signal usually operating system . 
, `` interrupt vector '' use store address 
function handle interrupt . 
, basic dos care whether printer report ready 
print stuff - simply ignore interrupt . 

dos print , look lpt buffer . 
character , 
wait check . 
, copy new character 
lpt port . 
since irq 7 ignore printer interrupt , 
free use adapter - case , sb . 
multitasking otherwise advance os , kind printing 
approach work precisely , waste lot cpu 
cycle . 
hence , `` share '' irq 7 sb ` re 
run unix whatnot . 
another issue sb digitized sound use 
interrupt . 
sb play plain music , cpu simply tell 
play tell otherwise . 
digitize sound interrupt 
require notify cpu output end new datum 
need . 
, however , hook two com port one interrupt , use 
one time . 
interrupt handling routine 
port , see port datum come 
. 
, course , apply device like lpt well . 
remember , greatly simplify part , think give 
general picture correctly enough .
