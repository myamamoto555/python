use industrial center need .

yes , hear find evidence war , btw japan 
seriously consider surrender first bomb .

end . 
unfortunately , live perfect world 
perfect solution . 
one go resist tyranny , 
innocent people side go suffer die . 
say 
ok -- unfortunate , sometimes necessary .

would agree evil sense cause much pain 
suffering . 
sure unnecessary say . 

conclusion arrive evaluate factor involve . 
perhaps unnecessary let 's say know . 

mean make decision bomb see 
necessary . 
rarely one full know consequence 
action make decision . 
time may seem 
necessary enough go ahead . 
assume feel bombing morally justify -- 
! 
condemn make difficult 
decision difficult circumstance .

certainly position moral relativist . 
, absolutist , position judge , defer judgment .

wrong . 
neither moral . 
seem necessary 
make decision bring quick end war .

refuse condemn decision .

ivan stang would say , `` jesus

btw , reason bring germany 
bemoan iraqi civilian casualty 
`` deplorable '' . 
yet blanket bombing institute bombing 
accurate enough hit target 
decisive way method time . 
gulf war , 
precision bombing norm . 
point , make big 
stink relatively civilian casualty result 
spite precision bombing , many civilian 
proportionately quantitatively die blanket bombing 
ww2 ? 
even precision bombing , mistake happen 
civilian suffer . 
less civilian suffer war 
history ! 
many iraqi civilian go life 
minimal interference ally air raid . 
story 
`` hundred thousand '' iraqi civilian dead plain bunk . 
yes , bunk . 
us lose 230,000 serviceman ww2 four year 
majority directly involve fight ! 

expect swallow `` hundred thousand '' 
civilian iraqis die war last 2 month ! 

ally use precise bomb ever create ! 
hogwash . 
`` hundred thousand '' iraqi civilian die , 
due action hussein take people , due 
allied bombing .
