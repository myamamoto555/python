april 13 , 1993 response al moore : 
basically problem israel may remain , leave , occupy 
territory ; , neither . 
far , 
continue propose remain . 
palestinians propose 
leave . 
either change view ? 
worth point 
area compromise accomodate view seem require 
reduction israeli presence . 
israel propose reduction ... 
fact may say negotiate . 

tim : 
seem two perception address . 

first israel , little trust arab group , 
little support israel give tangible asset 
exchange piece paper , `` expectation '' , `` hope '' , etc. . 
second 
arab , demand 
`` tangible concession '' make israel without receive 
anything tangible back . 
give , gap two stance 
seem need israel receive tangible return 
expect concession . 
`` tangible '' mean something 
1 provide israel `` comparable '' protection land 
give , 2 way ensure arab state palestine 
accountable held actively `` diplomatically 
responsible uphold action territory citizen 
`` visitor '' . 
essence believe israel objection palestinian 
statehood would anywhere near strong israel 
assure new palestinian state would commit 
co-exist israel hold responsible attack israel 
territory . 
aside rather slant proposal , 
could `` guarantee '' instil ? 
example , 
could `` guarantee '' `` control '' add 
palestinian proposal ? 
israel hang largely scared stiff minute 
let go give land back arab state , `` buffer zone '' , give 
full autonomy palestinians , arab party 
could would , `` control '' somehow easily return 
traditional anti-israel position . 
question really 
ensure happen .
