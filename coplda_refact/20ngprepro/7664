deskjet

second suggestion . 
although hp portable deskjet , 
hp deskjet 500 . 
give nicest output , 
minor loss quality . 
intensive purpose papers , letter , 
resume , treat deskjet like laser printer 
look bit closely see blur character . 
one 
grudge , ink hp give smudge rather quickly 
presence moisture even though ink waterproof . 
however , 
would spend $ 500 laser quality . 
cannon nice , however seem 
much support eg : driver popular program hp ink-jet . 
also hp deskjet regular , plus c accept xerox paper believe 
feeder option cannon . 
mind refill printer cheap ink say 
ink , hp deskjet cheap maintain 
pay $ 3.50 last bottle ink expect last 9 
month . 
- kimball work hp , love printer 
much ! 
ps : question netter , afraid refill 
waterproof ink sell house bring 
bottle waterproof ink clog cartridge . 

wonder ` good ' waterproof ink aside buy 
refill cartridge ?
