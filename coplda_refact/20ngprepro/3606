agree darren say , would like add 
personal observation . 
see arrogance problem 
sense personal certainty , lack respect 
come differ conclusion . 
clearly , 
christian vs. non-christian ; whole spectrum belief system 
within christianity . 
tend argue matter 
personal faith , like aesthetics , 
objective means . 
choose believe rely important area personal 
sovereignty . 
bother suggest , 
matter faith , specific belief true 
absolute bind . 
follow 
god must give everyone revelation truth , thus 
anyone come different conclusion intentionally choose 
wrong path . 
arrogance see ; lack respect 
honest conclusion matter god . 
even personal certainty leave room belief . 

universalize matter personal faith , couple proud 
notion one 's relationship god superior 's , 
lead arrogance . 
honest opinion .

certainly reasonable ask humility 
ability know truth . 
also different path 
area practice . 
would like see clarification 
mean reject idea say `` specific belief 
true absolute bind 
. '' 
something true , true everyone , assume 
belief something god , history , etc. . 
course something 
form `` believe best xxx '' could true 
people . 
suggest past god 
may less concerned doctrinal agreement many people . 
mean doubt difference 
true false , think benefit find 
true .
