traditional wisdom say almost certainly better sell 
mind extra hassle . 
trade-in purchase 
make get best price dealership confusing . 
> know `` blue book '' value car $ 2825 . 
assume _ retail _ bluebook . 
two bluebook price , one 
retail one wholesale . 
really want retail price 
get . 
blue book also adjustment make low mileage 
extra particular car . 
look stuff . 
also keep mind blue book price average country 
may apply area . 
example , blue book price low 
california . 
better way find much car might worth 
call around see sell use lot one 
look local papers similar car check price . 

might time efficient take small loss rather hold 
6 month best price . 
> 
> offer give blue book value car . 
know mean `` acquaintance '' would make darn sure 
pay , , cashier 's check full delivery . 

real temptation sell accomodate 
. 
make sure get money hedge pay 
full start cashier 's check cash would go 
elsewhere . 
probably sell car used car lot 
wholesaler get wholesale bluebook . 
probably safer approach 
sell private party .
