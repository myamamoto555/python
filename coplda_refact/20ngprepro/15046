say kind `` electronic equipment '' mean . 
hard 
give generic answer . 
essentially solvent 
thing like wash lubricant switch . 
need emergency cleaning job thing , 
use distilled water . 
key thing remember make sure gear 
completely dry power . 
let dry 
several day damn sure . 
doubt methanol significant advantage water . 
would 
wary ccl4 , least dangerous even 
go harm equipment -- poisonous , 
believe know carcinogenic .
