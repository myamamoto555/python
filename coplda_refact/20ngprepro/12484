robin scroggs build upon discussion predecessor 
suggest new twist word . 
scroggs believe 
`` hellenistic jewish coinage , perhaps influence awareness rabbinic 
terminology . '' 
term derive lev 18 `` 22 & 20:13 lxx 
juxtapose two word `` male '' `` bed '' , represent 
hebrew zabar `` lie male '' . 
yet believe paul 
originate term , borrow `` circle hellenistic jews 
acquaint rabbinic discussion '' 180 n. 14 . 
invent avoid 
`` contact usual greek terminology '' 108 . 
true , scroggs 
observe , explain word appear greco-roman discussion 
pederasty later patristic writer avoid . 
meaningless 
greek 108 . 
scroggs take second part active word first word 
object second part , thus differ boswell 's `` learn discussion '' 
107 . 
yet scroggs understand general meaning `` one lie 
male '' narrow reference . 
precede cor 6:9 , 
scroggs interpret `` effeminate , '' 
active partner `` keep ` mistress ' hire 
occasion satisfy sexual desire '' 108 . 
hence 
refer homosexuality general , female homosexuality , generic 
model pederasty . 
certainly refer modern gay model , 
affirm 109 . 
's interpretation term tim 1:10 also . 

combination `` '' , `` slave 
dealer '' refer `` male prostitute , male lie , slave 
dealer procure '' 120 . 
refer specific form 
pederasty `` consist enslaving boy youth sexual 
purpose , use boy adult male '' 121 . 
even `` serious 
mind pagan author '' condemn form pederasty . 
use 
instance cor tim interpret apparently 
general condemnation female male homosexuality rom 1 . 
consequently paul `` must , could pederasty mind '' 122 . 
know paul would say `` contemporary model 
mutuality sex relation ship '' 122 . 
relate term context contemporary ethical 
concern , scroggs emphasize point specific item list 
vice cor 6 deliberate , intended meaning paul . 
form 
function catalogue vice traditional stereotyped . 

relationship individual item list context usually 
nonexistent . 
conclude paul `` care specific item 
list '' 104 . 
basis meaning term literary 
phenomenon `` catalogue vice , '' scroggs argue scriptures 
`` irrelevant provide help heated debate today '' 129 . 
`` model 
today 's christian homosexual community different model 
attack nt '' `` biblical judgment homosexuality 
relevant today 's debate . 
longer use denominational 
discussion homosexuality , way weapon justify 
refusal ordination ... '' 127 . 
reaction new interpretation 
d. wright 
recent year position bailey , boswell , scroggs 
come closer scrutiny . 
perhaps critical evaluation boswell 's 
view david wright . 
thorough article , wright point 
several shortcoming boswell 's treatment . 
fault 
boswell fail cite , cite inaccurately , reference lev 
18:22 20:13 church father , eusebius , `` apostolic 
constitution , '' clement alexandria , tertullian origen . 
boswell consider seriously enough possibility term 
derive either form meaning leviticus passage 129 . 

significant , term derive , clearly refute boswell 's 
claim first half word - denote object 
gender second half - . 
lxx must mean `` male sleep 
male , '' make - object . 
wright also fault boswell 's claim regard linguistic feature 
term , include suggest parallel 129 . 
though boswell claim 
compound - employ objectively - employ 
adjective , wright believe difference two merely 
one dialectical diversity : `` semantic import attach difference 
two form '' 131 . 
wright believe compound 
second half verb verbal force , first half denote 
object `` second part , first half denote 
gender '' 132 . 
boswell 's treatment early church father wright 
take special issue , former fail cite source . 
example , aristides ' apology c. ad 138 probably use , 
, basic meaning male 
homosexuality 133 , contrary boswell 's discussion . 
boswell fail cite 
hippolytus . 
. 
haer . 
-23 improperly cite eusebius 
syriac writer . 
latter use syriac term identical 
syriac cor 6:9 tim 1:10 . 
next wright show early church father use 
parallel refer male homosexuality teenager , 
dominant form male homosexuality among greeks 134 . 
sometimes 
parallelism occur threefold listing `` adultery '' , 
`` fornication '' , , replace 
136 . 
clement alexandria . 
cite second table 
ten commandment `` shall kill , ou `` shall commit 
adultery '' , ou `` shall practice homosexuality 
boy '' , shall steal ... '' 150 n. 43 . 
another occurrence `` commit homosexuality '' exist 
sibylline oracles -73 . 
may , wright observe , word 
coin jewish pre-christian writer hellenistic setting represent 
, book 2 . 
wright also discuss use 6th c. draw 
upon first century ad writer teucer , macarius 4th-5th c. , john 
faster d. 595 . 
last particular bear idea 
homosexual intercourse , contrary boswell . 
wright next reply boswell 's contention term would 
absent `` much literature homosexuality denote 
. 
wright point expect writer prior 
first century ad since exist , greeks use 
dozen word phrase refer homosexuality , source e.g. 
didache show acquaintance paul 's letter deliberately avoid cite 
scripture , boswell neglect cite several church father . 
boswell 's treatment chrysostom particular draw wright 's attention 
. 
boswell conspicuously misrepresent witness chrysostom , 
omit reference assert patently untrue . 
chrysostom give 
long uncompromising clear indictment homosexuality homily rom 
1:26 . 
boswell exaggerate chrysostom 's infrequent use term . 
wright 
observe boswell `` signally fail demonstrate 
etc. patently denote male homosexual 
activity '' 144 . 
infrequent relatively technical nature 
availability term clearly 
specify prevailing form male homosexuality greco-roman world . 
wright also survey latin , syriac , coptic translation tim 
cor . 
three render word reflect meaning 
`` homosexual '' i.e. , understand - object second half 
word . 
none primary version support boswell 's limited 
conclusion base . 
wright conclude discussion observation 
catalogue vice literary form . 
believe list develop 
late judaism hellenistic jews write clear condemnation 
homosexuality greek world . 
parallel increase concern 
part moral philosopher homosexual indulgence . 
term come 
influence lxx 145 writer speak `` generally 
male activity male rather specifically categorize male sexual 
engagement paide '' 146 . 

interchangeable , former encompass latter 146 . 
summary , wright seek show broad term meaning 
homosexuality arise judaism . 
view boswell , scroggs , 
limit term `` active male prostitute '' pederasty without 
significant support linguistic historical study . 
next : question wrights position william peterson . 
, 
get `` good '' stuff historical & linguistic study . 

include `` symposium '' plato . 
doubt modern 
understanding homosexuality understand time 
paul , certainly clear thing . 
also review paul 's use 
nt , , 1 law fulfil , 
away , 2 lev 18-20 universal follow chapter 
general . 
put forth ot longer hold true today 
culture , stick around one . 

13 r. scroggs , new testament homosexuality phil : 1983 86 , . 
independently come conclusion . 
apparently connection 
make e.a. sophocles , greek lexicon roman & byzantine period 
ad 1100 . 
14 see discussion , . 
say thing paul 's language 
rom 1:26 -27 128 . 
doubtful . 
see cautious word p. 
, `` cor 6.9 ff : homosexuality condone corinthian church ? 

17 1979 -12 . 
observe word , , 
part jewish polemic . 
yet paul 's wor end 
vice list , `` , '' indicate `` paul address real 
potential abuse ethical message , cite primitive tradition

reference sodom sodomy apocrypha pseudepigrapha . 
see j.b. 
deyoung , `` critique interpretation ot apocrypha 
pseudepigrapha , '' bsac 1990 -53 . 
20 light claim make boswell infrequency 
point meaning lack homosexual significance , wright ask pertinently 
`` neither philo josephus use , josephus , 
. 
. 
clement use latter chrysostom former ? '' 
152 n. 
71 recent article , `` homosexuality : relevance bible , '' 
61 1989 -300 , wright reiterate point .
