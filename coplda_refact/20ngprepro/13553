robert refer `` orthodox '' , talk historical 
position christian faith . 
thing derive 
text century father faith . 
right people read thing differently bible , 
alright part like parable forth . 
however , come 
essential doctrine historical orthodox christan beliefs , 
one correct way read . 
example , either 
doctrine trinity true , false . 
yes , people read 
text differently , one position true . 
. 
accord text , doctrine true always exist . 
therefore , people like joseph smith come along vision 
think undo century doctrine support 
bible , people consider cult .
