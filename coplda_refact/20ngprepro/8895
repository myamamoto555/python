know `` low grade '' fusion reactor , major 
problem 3he aside difficulty make fusion 
reactor work concentration lunar regolith 
small -- order 5 ppb , average 
fraction , still small . 
massive amount regolith would 
process . 
thread remind wingo 's claim time ago moon 
source titanium use earth . 
recall , wingo 
content assure titanium .5 % earth 's crust , 
average would run , tout lunar mine , even though 
market price ilmenite concentrate day around $ .06 pound . 
prompt look large potential terrestrial source . 
moon , titanium occur basalt ; `` '' basalt apollo 11 
17 8-14 % titanium dioxide weight . 
nice , ... 
terrestrial continental flood basalt also typically enrich 
titanium . 
often 3 % tio2 , frequently 4 % , 
sometimes even 5 % tio2 , weight . 
flood basalt 
enormous -- million cubic kilometer , scatter 
world siberia , brazil , nw united states , ethiopia , etc. . 

even 1 % basalt 5 % tio2 , trillion ton tio2 
concentration factor 2-3 less lunar 
basalt . 
difficult see disadvantage moon 
could overcome small increase concentration 
ore never mind richer , less common , terrestrial ore 
mine today .
