legitimate point . 
baseball entertainment , 
quarrel people find certain style play entertaining 
, regardless . 
personally , huge fan 
; doubt play , get big kick 
. 
willing live bad consequence exchange fun . 
course , claim galarraga 's 
inability defer gratification hurt team `` 
pay walk '' `` guy '' whatever . 
> finally , would like point many high obp guy draw 
> walk pitcher afraid throw strike 
> , great `` eye '' 
sure . 
use think true , become 
convinced way around : among player physical 
ability hit ball real hard , patient one one get 
chance lot . 
let 's break four basic category hitter , accord whether 
power threat whether walk lot : 
power power 
patient frank thomas brett butler 
barry bonds ozzie smith 
mark mcgwire craig grebeck 
babe ruth miller huggins 
ted williams billy hamilton 
rickey henderson eddie joost 
joe morgan mike hargrove 
.

. 
. 
impatient ernie banks ozzie guillen 
dave kingman shawon dunston 
joe carter andres thomas 
george bell jose lind 
kirby puckett devon white 
etc. . 
far tell , category full . 
really look like 
two independent . 
nobody could possibly afraid craig grebeck 
plate , yet walk quite lot . 
part , undoubtedly , 
small stature , surely major league pitcher hit sort 
target least 3 time 6 . 
randy milligan even better example ; 
show noticeable power one partial season , walk 
place , despite huge strike zone .
