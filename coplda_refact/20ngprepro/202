applaud investing money yehuda , shomron , v ` , 
order create job resident , find deplorable 
never active policy israeli administration 
since 1967 , regard jewish resident . 
past government 
find fund subsidize cheap read : affordable housing 
requisite infrastructure , investment create 
industry would generate income job ? 
26 year , yehuda shomron remain barren , bereft even 
middle-sized industry , jewish settlement sterile 
`` bedroom community '' , haven main israelis 
secular religious work tel-aviv jerusalem 
afford live either city surrounding suburb . 
old saying : `` bli , ayn '' -- live 
enough , really settle . 
instead , `` settle '' 
potemkin village , pay price 
.
