interpretation denning 's description s1 s2 choose 
randomly agent key escrow company start 300 - 
chip programming session . 
imagine chip carrier 
allow program fairly quickly - would 
need transfer chip one time little plum programmer 
people envision . 
guess procedure use base key 
s1 s2 use specify algorithm provide checkable 
way verify back door exist choice random number 
use generate key . 
since trust escrow company 
anyway , weaken system key generate 
random seed enter escrow agent . 
since algorithm 
public modulo skipjack secrecy principle 
agent could challenge procedure , ask s1 s2 expose , 
run independent calculation u1 u2 verify 
actually put onto floppy . 
yes , many way failure follow scheme could 
hard check . 
laptop probably really destroy 
time . 
hidden camera ceiling could see s1 s2 enter 
trust escrow agent . 
back door chip could allow u 
recover . 
heck , chip could record u , ignore 
floppy .
