would use secret nope , obscure cryptographic encode expand 
30 bit serial number 64 bit block . 
redundancy hereby introduce 
use detect tampered clipper signal public enemy 
replace l.e. block random datum . 
course l.e. block would use encryption 
user datum receive end correct l.e. block must 
process order chance get plaintext back . 
might want mangle l.e. block e.g. 
constant pattern transmission line restore feed 
receive crippler chip would add encrypted copy 
block perhaps create repeat application encryption 
algorithm regular interval transmission . 

receive chip detect mismatch must assume line bad 
cease work ; interest protect get 
faulty plaintext , know -- like checksum 
safety . 
` monitoring agency ' famous black box need 
actual decryption keep fbi ; nothing prevent 
use special box redundancy check 
serial number block consistency check embedded l.e. block 
within transmission . 
box turn red light soon 
detect bitstream violate correct protocol . 
anyone think use chip fool l.e. 
tap key -- bet provide much better check 
suggest . 
course absolutely crucial 
algorithm protocol remain secret . 
personally doubt .
