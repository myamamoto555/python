like `` order '' occur first place ... indicate 
earlier post , `` irrational hatred '' clearly evidence 
individual like robert weiss could gov. boggs ' lieutenant ; 
would fit right , et al , seem modern-day 
occurrence , base result slander , persecution , misrepresentation , 
lie , deny mormons representation user group , etc. etc. . 
intent purpose , really change ? 
#the situation entirely different today . 
many irrational feeling 
belief justify religion . 
think 
start religion , religion certainly help justify 
prejudice practice provide neat justification

must primarily purpose . 
mean secular authority watch , believe 
satan give power dominion earth divert 
truth , judgment , justice . 
addition , believe adversary 
power influence unjust idolatrous greed money would 
good example order bring persecution , war , oppression , 
evil combination .
