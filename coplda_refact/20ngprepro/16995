keywords : mlb , 
organization : department industrial engineering 
lines : 93 
tim recently post summary last year 's defensive average 
stats term linear weights estimate defensive 
performance , compare league average . 
combine 
mlv number come total 
run value player last year . 
use springboard 
reconsideration mvp award . 
major caveat : number include defensive park adjustment , 
san diego really question odd score gopher hole 
infield , cause inaccuracy . 
offensive number 
, park adjust , deflate 
inflate fair . 
finally , still know 
catcher , idea evaluate defensive contribution 
tony phillips bip roberts . 
say , still surprise . 
let 's look national 
league first . 
number total run contribute season . 
player offense defense total 
sandberg 44 32 76 
bond 67 3 70 
walker 26 26 52 
justice 14 33 47 
daulton 44 ?? 
44 + ? 
larkin 36 4 40 
grace 13 27 40 
see , legitimate mvp candidate last season . 
deflate sandberg 's offense wee bit play wrigley , 
get essentially dead heat . 
bond usual defensive self , 
would close , apparently case . 
darren 
daulton need 22 defensive run make offensive difference , 
could tell whether easy impossible . 
good case 
could make sandberg , bonds , daulton top dude . 
personal vote : bond , sandberg , daulton , walker , justice . 
american league : 
player offense defense total 
ventura 22 34 56 
martinez 47 -1 46 
b. anderson 21 25 46 
thomas 47 -5 42 
r. henderson 25 16 41 
raines 17 23 40 
tettleton 33 ?? 
33 + ? 
ok , let 's see show hand : many pick robin ventura top 
player al last year ? 
certainly , would hard time 
argue point . 
yes , know number 
approximate , big gap # 2 guy . 
also , 
think rickey henderson stink last year mind . 
, catcher ointment . 
call game 
important might , 23 run easy make give away . 
take 
guess , folk ; think better . 
personal vote exclude pitcher : 
ventura , tettleton , anderson , martinez , henderson . 
big frank thomas fan , admit bias favor 
balanced contribution , higher 
leverage record equal shift lot offense 
negative defense . 
record : 
carlos baerga 27 5 32 
roberto alomar 35 -2 33 
forget ; wash . 
let also take opportunity admit grossly wrong regard 
mattingly 's defense past season . 
recover brilliantly 
weak '90 '91 end 
mattingly -1 17 16 run 
clearly above-average first baseman . 
however , still 18 run 
behind mark mcgwire , 26 run behind frank thomas , 7 run behind john 
olerud . 
hand , ahead rafael palmeiro , cecil fielder , 
every al first baseman yet mention .
