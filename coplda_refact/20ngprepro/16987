let press ? 
let koresh talk press ? 
maybe allow talk couple 
day would surrender peacefully . 
let relative koresh ` follower talk ? 
seem isolate someone , try send crazy play 
loudspeaker night tibetan chant , etc. , ` 
much stand behave crazy .

suspicious government control communication , 
send press 2 mile away . 
gut feeling warrant , seal , would 
stand scrutiny . 
` think warrant constitution writer 
mind give rights improper search seizure . 
` think all-powerful central , government 
constitution writer mind rights 
citizen state restricted central government .
