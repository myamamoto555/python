self reference circular . 
since evaluation 
usefulness possible within rational system , allow . 
argument silly prove mathematical statement need mathematics 
mathematics circular .

`` belief '' strong theism

speak religious system contradictory definition 
god . 
axiomatic datum lend rational analysis , say 
often refute fallacy . 
look discussion 
axiom choice . 
, one evaluate axiom larger system 
usually derive . 
`` exist '' derive , want 
way . 
, one test consistency set axiom .

formalise argument ? 
person believe system b becuase sound nice . 
make 
b true , best work hypothesis . 
however , content b 
true work hypothesis . 
test evaluate 
evidence therefore dismiss b already believe 
say wrong waste time possible . 
depend 
contents b kill , 
interesting effect . 
answer question absolute set moral people agree like 
would agree football football .
