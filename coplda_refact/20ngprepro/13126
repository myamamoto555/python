read post kirlian whatever spelling 
photography could help slightly disgust 
narrow-minded , `` know '' , `` believe see 
measure '' attitude many people . 

neither real believer , disbeliever come

convince serious mistake close mind 
something , anything , simply fit current frame 
reference . 
history show many great people , great scientist , 
people keep open mind - ridicule sceptic .
