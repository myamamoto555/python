whatever

new boundary draw negotiation ,

unless new boundary draw 48 peace . 
precious little authority agree anything else . 
real issue land treaty trade treaty . 
since 
palestinians remain heavily dependent israel indefinitely 
guarantor peace . 
another factor 
return land confiscate israeli state within israel 
dismantle shadow structure allow discrimination 
non-jew within secular state . 
irony return guarantee palestinian state 
non law order protect remain settler 
israeli state go force position . 
mean 
outlaw discrimination prevent arab buy 
use much land .
