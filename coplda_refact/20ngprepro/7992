suddenly appear quickly disappear . 
think weak argument . 
fact , two reference 
jesus _ antiquities jews _ , one unquestionably least 
alter christian . 
origen write , third century , 
josephus recognize jesus messiah , long passage 
say opposite . 
arabic manuscript _ antiquity 
jews _ contain version passage much less gung-ho 
jesus may authentic . 
question origen , third century , see reference 
jesus josephus . 
manuscript _ antiquity _ 
lack reference . 
possible fabricate whole cloth insert , 
think likely -- think consensus 
scholarly community case . 
know g.a. wells take 
position , take small minority view 
jesus never exist . 
professor german , 
biblical history new testament anything directly relevant 
historicity jesus .
