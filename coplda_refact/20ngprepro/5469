know much pc 's ibm comp might try joystick 
port . 
though try , tell port 
build a-d converter . 
would allow joystick couple 
pot . 
could find spec might work ... 
believe `` a-d converter '' find joystick port really 
timer tick long take circuit r 
paddle charge something like vcc . 
game work 
pretty well , certainly would want try take lab 
measurement something non-linear . 
hmm ... suppose could software , real problem 
precision measurement longer constant higher 
voltage would precise . 
hand , could wrong perhaps game card designer 
splurge extra $ .50 make cheap constant current source 
op amp . 
would expect ...
