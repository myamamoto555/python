, though unfortunately `` official line '' one 
adhere want get full licence . 
examiner 's 
guideline lay government , basic rider education 
course choice follow . 
surprise none 
rider group , either mag bmf make much noise fact 
ride test require ride three foot curb time 
order pass , front brake must apply rear , 
keep look shoulder time instead 
justified - probably , 
think moment . 
ride test could rejig bit 
include real-world survival skill less 
woefully simplistic crap contain , accident figure 
would reduce still . 
think include countersteering knowledge test though ...
