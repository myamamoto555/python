cryptanalysis attacks 
--------------------- 
- break rsa would allow attacker find private key , 
case could read mail encrypt sign 
message private key . 
rsa generally believe resistant standard 
cryptanalytic technique . 
even standard key 516 bit 
long enough render impractical , bar 
huge investment hardware breakthrough factoring . 
- break des would allow attacker read give message , 
since message encrypt des . 
would allow 
attacker claim . 
des 56 bit key , thus could conceivably 
compromise brute force sufficient hardware , agency 
money devote simply read one message . 
since 
message different des key , work message would 
remain high . 
key management attack 
---------------------- 
- steal private key would allow benefit break 
rsa . 
safeguard , encrypt des key derive 
passphrase type . 
however , attacker get copy 
private passphrase snoop network 
packet , tap line , whatever could break whole scheme . 
main risk transfer either passphrase 
private key file across untrusted link . 
. 
run 
trust machine , preferably one sit right front 
. 
ideally , machine home maybe office 
nobody else physical access . 
- fooling accept bogus public key someone else could 
allow opponent deceive send secret message 
rather real recipient . 
enemy fool 
intended recipient well , could message 
bogus public key pass along . 
important get proper public key people . 
common mechanism finger ; assume opponent 
compromise router daemon , finger 
give fair amount trust . 
strongest method key 
authentication exchange key person ; however , 
always practical . 
people `` vouch '' 
sign statement contain key possible , although 
feature automatically 
pgp . 
generate check md5 fingerprint public key 
key file ; may exchange via separate channel 
authentication . 
playback attack 
---------------- 
- even opponent break cryptography , opponent could 
still cause difficulty . 
example , suppose send message 
pem mode provide disclosure protection 
alice say `` ok , let 's . '' 
opponent intercept 
, resend bob , message 
authenticate tell . 
course , may 
interpret entirely different context . 
opponent 
could transmit message recipient much later , 
figure would see differently later time . 

opponent could change : , register 
public key , send message hope recipient 
send return mail indicate perhaps even quote ! 

unknown message . 
defeat playback attack , plaintext message 
include indication sender recipient , unique 
identifier typically date . 
good front-end script 
automatically . 
recipient , 
sure : header sender indicate within 
plaintext , really recipient , 
message old one . 
also 
automate . 
author faq make modest attempt 
automate process generate check encapsulate 
header ; program include standard distribution 
util directory . 
local attack 
------------- 
- clearly , security greater security 
machine encryption perform . 
example , 
unix , could manage get encrypted mail , 
although would take planning effort something like 
replace executable trojan horse get copy 
plaintext , depend store . 
addition , link machine run 
extension . 
decrypt remote machine 
connect via network , worse yet , modem , 
eavesdropper could see plaintext probably also 
passphrase . 
execute system trust , obviously . 

extreme case , use machine , 
total control nobody else access 
, carefully examine software know free 
virus , . 
however , real trade-off 
convenience security . 
moderately cautious user might use unix workstation 
people access even root access , increase 
security keep private key statically link , 
course executable floppy disk . 
people keep multi-user system , dial 
insecure line , download message 
system perform decryption . 
however , 
security provide mechanism somewhat illusory ; since 
presumably type password log , 
give away store , since attacker log 
install trap account steal private key next time 
use less insecure line . 
likely remain 
situation long system use rather quaint mechanism 
password authentication . 
find nice put brief statement carefully manage 
security arrangement . 
plan next public key , 
potential correspondent aware level precaution 
place . 
people use two key , short one 
carefully manage ordinary use longer one treat 
greater care critical correspondence . 
untrusted partner attack 
------------------------- 
- 's encryption ensure person private key 
correspond public key use encrypt datum may read 
traffic . 
however , someone key get message , 
may always make whatever kind transformation wish . 

exist cryptographic barrier recipient , say , take 
encrypted message convert message , sign 
readable anyone , although provide 
functionality . 
indeed , latest pem draft see specifically 
state transformation possible allow 
forwarding function work . 
include recipient plaintext , mention , 
make possible recipient redistributed message aware 
original nature . 
naturally , security cryptography 
never greater security people use .
