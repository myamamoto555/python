mission director status report 
post-launch 
april 23 - 29 , 1993 
spacecraft 
1 . 
april 22 23 , delta differenced one-way range dor pass 
perform 63 70 meter antenna 43 
70 meter antenna , respectively . 
initial result 
indicate delta dor pass april 22 unsuccessful due ground 
station hardware problem one april 23 successfully perform . 
2 . 
april 23 , cruise science memory readout mro perform 
magnetometer mag instrument . 
analysis indicate datum receive 
properly . 
3 . 
april 23 , spare power relay contact command closed via 
spacecraft store sequence . 
relay command close cd 
command datum subsystem prior launch command close 
preclude possibility jupiter pps 
source internal electrostatic charge . 
4 . 
april 26 , cruise science memory readout mro perform 
extreme ultraviolet spectrometer euv , dust detector dd , magnetometer 
mag instrument . 
preliminary analysis indicate datum receive 
properly . 
5 . 
period april 26 april 27 , navigation cycle 
perform . 
navigation cycle provide near-continuous acquisition 
two-way doppler range datum three consecutive pass 
spacecraft , , . 
6 . 
april 26 , real-time command send test slew radio relay 
antenna rra preparation slew test april 28 . 
rra slew approximately 3.5 degree stow approximately 
20.3 degree . 
preliminary analysis indicate antenna slew 18 
degree well within predict range . 
rra command back 
approximately 15.2 degree stow . 
preliminary analysis indicate 
antenna reach 15.8 degree also well within predict range . 

rra motor temperature 1 degree c start activity 
increase 1.6 degree c completion . 
verify proper rra slewing , rra slew test 
uplink spacecraft execution april 28 . 
upon successful uplink , 
delay action command dac send reposition stator 
may 4 initial pre-test position . 
also , dac send turn 
two-way april 28 prior start rra slew test 
. 
7 . 
april 27 , command send reset command loss timer 
264 hour , plan value mission phase . 
8 . 
april 28 , rra slew test execute nominally . 
spacecraft 
store sequence control perform six rra slew start 16 degree 
stow go 53 degree , back 25 degree , 51 degree , 
back 22 degree , 48 degree back 21 degree . 

slew well within predict range . 
rra motor temperature 
2.3 degree c start activity increase 4.4 
degree c completion . 
completion rra slew , real-time 
command send reconfigure back pre-test configuration . 
9 . 
bus imbalance measurement exhibit significant change 
greater 25 dn throughout period . 
ac measurement read 17 dn 
3.9 volt . 
dc measurement read 134 dn 15.7 volt . 

measurement consistent model develop special 
anomaly team . 
10 . 
spacecraft status april 29 , 1993 , follow : 
system power margin - 75 watt 
b spin configuration - 
c spin - 3.15 scanner 
d spacecraft attitude approximately 23 degree 
lagging 4 degree lead 
e downlink telemetry - code 
f general thermal control - temperature within 
acceptable range 
g rpm tank pressure - within acceptable range 
h orbiter science - instruments power pws , 
euv , uvs , epd , mag , hic , dd 
- power , temperature within 
acceptable range 
j cmd loss timer setting - 264 hour
