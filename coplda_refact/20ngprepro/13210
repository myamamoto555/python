david , study look like good one . 
gordon rubenfeld medline 
search also send reference e-mail . 
since 
commercial yogurt always good lactobacillus a. 
bulgaricus culture , negative finding would informative . 
often reason lactobacillus acidophilus tablet 
recommend rather yogurt . 
guess next question would introduction `` good '' bacterium 
back gut decrease incidence vaginal candida bloom 
anus serve candida reservoir fact gordon r. 
deny ? 
see two possible theory . 
one , l. acidophilus , 
facultatively anaerobic bacterium , could make gut 
colonize rectal area overgrow candida . 
would explain 
candida bloom vagina yogurt ingestion 
stop though . 
additional bacterium 
intestinal tract remove glucose candida 
loose major food source . 
get lactobacillus acidophilus colonize vaginal tract 
normally find would much better effect vaginal 
yeast bloom though . 
acetic acid , lactobacillus acidophilus douche 
use get effect see treatment report 
medical literature . 
would example physician conduct 
clinical trial try come treatment help 
patient . 
private practice , result rarely , 
ever publish . 
hallmark medicine modern age 
emerge clinical trial . 
really raise big question . 

medical profession cast try new treatment 
help patient look way . 
particular issue really simple one since real dangerous 
therapy involve even anti-fungal dangerous . 

area like edta chelation therapy , fire pretty 
hot somebody could get burn . 
really tough . 
follow 
well establish protocol give work well 
try something look like work prove 
work yet ? 
stand consider treatment possibility , especially 
involve little risk patient . 
get good bacterium back 
gut antibiotic treatment one treatment possibility . 

get l. acidophilus vaginal tract woman 
problem recur yeast infection .
