kevin , unfortunately delving field know little 
, algorithm . 
reasoning , see , much along 
line roger penrose , claim mathematical ` insight ' 
algorithmic book _ emperor 's new mind : concern 
computer , mind , law physics _ . 
however , penrose 's 
claim _ _ mathematical insight , similar claim 
wavefunction collapse consciously take look , 
could illusion . 
take different viewpoint - try ponder 
problem consciousness evolutionary perspective , 
realize might anything special , certainly 
useful .

true extent . 
however , think brain 
work like computer , . 
fact , substantial evidence 
, 1985 ; & freeman 1987 brain work less 
chaotically , generate enough randomness mental state evolve . 
brain work much like genetic algorithm generator , suppose .

indeed , extremely unlikely , give vast impact nurture 
mind brain . 
suggest , however , try 
understand consciousness collection algorithm . 
kevin , take look reference mention , think . 
still think best expert nature conscious mind 
neurologist , neuropsychologist biologist 
flame opinion , since study 
conscious . 
reason repeat advice discussion 
lead anywhere background different . 
please , bring qm discussion - 
physicist happy claim consciousness 
play special role physics .

forget . 

mean need something else work - work differently . 
primary ` purpose ' perception guidance action , 
self-awareness high intelligence later appearance .

color mixture ? 
still expect could find idea ` green ' 
brain somewhere , perhaps form chemical . 

see . 
sensation ` green ' certain time-dependent 
pattern area v4 visual cortex , distribute 
help area v1 v2 rest brain . 
indeed , firing pattern . 
sometimes think consciousness 
global free induction pattern local firing pattern , 
idle speculation . 
scientific american 's september 1992 issue special issue 
mind brain . 
already read cover cover ? 
; - 
two article visual perception , might 
interested . 
, please note subjective experience 
observe third-person perspective . 
see nothing 
neuronal activity , go conclude 
mind . 
kalat 1988 write numerous example electric stimulation 
different area brain lead various change 
patient ' state mind . 
instance , patient whose septal area 
stimulate without knowledge remote control 
psychiatric interview quickly cure depression , 
start discuss plan seduce girlfriend . 
stimulation temporal lobe sometimes lead embarrassing 
situation , patient start flirt 
therapist . 
conclusion , evidence 
1 brain essentially necessary subjective experience , 
brain damage usually equivalent sort mind damage 
2 conscious process involve substantial brain activity 
various area brain - think color , 
visual cortex activate etc. . 
3 consciousness afterthought - become conscious 
action half second delay , brain ahead 
` conscious ' least 350 ms. 
thus , think fruitful turn question `` ` ' see 
color '' around ask `` ` ' seem 
observe ? '' 
, since seem conscious mind 
king brain .

depend mean ` see color ' . 
neural 
network capable recognize handwritten number 
0 9 see number , capable sort ? 
ask , `` animal conscious 
observer evolutionary advantage animal 
'' , good answer - read previous post , 
write sense identity help social animal swap 
role act morally , unconsciously 
kill newly discover weapon . 
bit extreme , 
basic idea . 
early _ homo _ become efficient use tool , 
sense identity concept ` self ' evolve 
line development . 
indeed , respect 
conscious altruistic behavior might evolutionary advantage 
social animal , early human .

mind require , mean human 
mind come scene , wavefunction never collapse , remain 
superposition aeon ? 
, powerful . 
discuss , think topic irrelevant , 
since agree mind necessary , neither

agree , sense apparently mean - physics
