khufu khafre patented # . 
biham shamir show 
differential cryptanalysis break 16-round khafre choose - 
plaintext attack use 1500 different encryption . 
khafre 24 round 
break attack use 2 ^ 53 different encryption . 
probably efficient differential cryptanalytic attack , 
someone want take time look . 
khufu s-box , immune differential cryptanalysis . 
source code algorithm khafre patent . 
public-domain one-way hash function . 
version 
produce 128-bit hash vulnerable differential cryptanalysis 
vulnerable means attack efficient brute force 
four pass less . 
give , sha md5 much efficient . 
oh yes , anyone interested license patent contact dave petre , 
director patent licencing xerox , .
