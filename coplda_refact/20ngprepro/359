twin-cam , right ? 
steel guard right next 
sprocket keep broken chain punch hole 
engine case , need . 
probably enough room 
fit bigger sprocket . 
would incline take two tooth rear 5 % ratio 
change rather add one front 7 % . 

raise overall gear ratio much 'll impair bike 's 
, gear far enough apart 
one gear provide adequate response 
give speed . 
honda 750 widest power 
band .
