sorry double post , forget something . 
`` make , use sell '' context non-standard meaning : 
`` make '' mean make encrypted message . 
`` use '' may mean use pgp , 
use encrypted message . 
`` sell '' would probably mean sell 
encrypted message . 
message create `` patented '' process 
incorporate pgp , infringe .
