random thought ride passenger : 
substitute bike sufficient power , take 
passenger occasionally small 125 etc bike use 
ride uk hard ! 
ride great , 
even move freind ride recently . 
may due 
part fact neither , regular passenger , 
particularly slimline ! 
always tell passenger , stay line bike corner , make 
movement predictable . 
regular passenger tend hold either rack nothing , 
really like passenger hold onto except short period . 
may bias fact couple new passenger 
friend recently first time bike hold real tight , 
make kind maneuver difficult . 
also discover longer trip prefer passenger move 
shift weight bit . 
recently take work meeting 
1 hour ride sit totally still whole way leave also 
sit still get sore back . 
code system turn , stop ' need shift position ' .
