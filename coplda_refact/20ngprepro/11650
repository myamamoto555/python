legal send ? 
believe legal send des code equipment us canada 
export license . 
think place - 
country require license . 
aside , always think legal send des software 
anywhere , follow rule : 
1 . 
encrypt des software des . 
2 . 
send encrypted software recipient . 
3 . 
send key recipient . 
way person end use des software 
already des available - otherwise , decrypt 
program , useless . 
guarantee already des , 
really violate law send form 
program ?? 
sure still illegal , seem like good idea ...
