since neither side would particularly interested tell truth , 
weigh ` fact ' give , weigh 
care . 
many cult member probably side attorney , 
lie , change story match . 
feds also 
lie , cult member become disillusion change 
story match feds . 
neither side interested truth . 
media interested , 
usually either time get straight tie 
rating deliberately distort . 
, though , black soot billow outside compound add 
fast fire spread pont someone douse large part 
compound sort gasoline . 
doubt feds 
interested arrest vernon . 
real 
unbalanced one least one lose cool vernon , 
figure likely jesus 
persecute authority , follower hold onto , 
make decision . 
follower also probably feel 
rocket heaven stuff . 
conclusion , come 
umpteen million hour listen npr radio 
show always radio go office 
innocuous talk-show news program background noise .
