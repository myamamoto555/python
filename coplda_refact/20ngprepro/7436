best way prevent kidney stone form take b6 
supplement . 
read find asbestos suit guy . 
vitamin c form oxalic acid . 
large dose need 6 gram

glycine also form oxalic acid d-amino acid oxidase . 

glycine vitamin c , one best way drastically reduce 
production cut back dietary intake vitamin c glycine , 
increase intake vitamin b6 .

patient receive least b6 day 
show significant reduction urinary oxalate level . 
, effect due increase transaminase activity b6 
require transaminase activity make less glycine available 
oxidative deamination d-amino acid oxidase . 
vitamin c , effect 
quite different . 
different pathway vitamin c catabolism . 
pathway lead oxalic acid formation usually 17 40 % 
ingest dose go oxalic acid . 
highly variable 
vitamin c review article point unless dose get upto 
6 gram per day , much vitamin c get form oxalic 
acid . 
high dose vitamin c 10 gram per day , 
extra vitamin c 40 % conversion end oxalic acid . 

early study vitamin c oxalic production proc . 
soc . 
exp . 
biol . 
med . 
-92 1954 , intake 2 gram per day 9 gram per day 
increase average oxalic acid excretion per day 
per day . 
8 gram per day reach , average excrete 
increase 3 per day 2 gram dose , 4 gram dose , 8 gram dose 
dose . 
8 gram jump average excretion 
supplementation 9 gram jump 150 mg average 
supplementation . 
b6 require enzyme vitamin body . 

probably enzyme require vitamin b6 know 
yet . 
vitamin c catabolism still completely understand 
speculation pathway form oxalic acid must 
enzyme require b6 . 
difference b6 level could 
explain variable production oxalic acid vitamin c 
challenge prefer route catabolism . 
increase 
intake b6 would result less oxalic acid 
take vitamin c supplement . 
since typical american diet deficient 
b6 , researcher believe main cause 
kidney stone b6 deficiency especially since little oxalic acid get 
absorb gut . 
diet provide 0 oxalic acid per day 
show absolutely change urinary excretion oxalate int 
. 
present day , significant increase 
urinary oxalate excretion . 
high oxalate food : 
1 . 
bean , coca , instant coffee , parsley , rhubarb , spinach tea . 
contain least 
2 . 
beet top , carrot , celery , chocolate , cumber , grapefruit , kale , 
peanut , pepper , sweet potatoe . 
contain 10 25 . 
threshold per day , see really lot 
latitude food selection . 
recent . 
med . 
article also point 
one good way prevent kidney stone formation increase 
intake calcium prevent dietary oxalate 
absorb . 
also increase intake b6 , 
worry kidney stone . 
rda b6 per day 
male 1.6 mg per day female directly relate protein intake . 
b6 toxic nerve damage consume dose 
per day extended week month . 
usda food survey 1986 average intake 1.87 mg per day 
male 1.16 mg per day female live u.s. couple 
low intake high protein diet greatly increase b6 
requirement , well presence 40 different drug 
either block b6 absorption , metabolic antagonist b6 , promote b6 
excretion urine . 
common one : birth control pill , alcohol , 
isoniazid , , corticosteroid . 
tell student 
supplement patient go get drug 
increase b6 requirement . 
dose recommend patient take 
birth control pill per day work 
drug increase b6 requirement would top 
dietary intake b6 . 
patient history kidney stone 
formation give b6 supplement .

actually three time many article publish 
medical literature role magnesium prevent kidney stone 
formation b6 . 
think pretty safe 
state magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation earlier 
post news group good old john a. mass. jump . 

guess read medical literature . 
oh well , since kidney 
stone real pain lot people suffer , think 
would tell avoid pain stay doctor 's office .
