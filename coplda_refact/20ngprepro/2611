larry l. write , respond simon : 
may interesting see brief selection post 
net . 
understanding sspx consider 
schism legitimately excommunicate . 
really beside 
point . 
roman catholic church say ? 
excommunication real apart formal excommunication , 
provide canon law . 
theology involve interested . 
confusion issue sspx 's `` schism '' ; often 
basic problem lack ability distinguish : 
- true obedience 
- false obedience 
- disobedience 
- schism 
take various classification obedience first . 
2 
important element involve purpose : 
1 command 
2 response make command 
far command go , command legitimate , 
pope order catholics eat meat fridays . 

illegitimate , pope order catholics worship god 
dagon every full moon come around . 
far response command go , refuse 
command , comply . 
make table , thus 4 : 
command response name 

legitimate comply true obedience 
illegitimate refuse true obedience 
legitimate refuse disobedience 
illegitimate comply false obedience 
see 3 classification obedience come . 
obedience solely matter . 
nature 
command must also take account ; enough 
consider someone 's compliance refusal say whether 
`` obedient '' `` disobedient '' . 
also take consideration 
whether command good bad . 
example , pope command catholics worship god 
dagon , refuse , disobedient ! 
far society saint pius x go , certainly 
refuse comply certain thing pope desire . 

alone insufficient allow one label `` disobedient '' . 

also consider nature papal desire . 
rub : sspx say popes since vatican ii 
command certain bad thing church . 
popes 
course disagree . 
? 
another arian heresy , complete weak 
pope ? 
sspx priest modern martin ? 
well , 
way answer examine say , 
traditional teaching church . 
problem catholics much idea 
really go , issue . 
religion 
american catholics especially defective intellectual depth . 

never read issue discuss catholic press 
country . 
hand , one italian catholic magazine 
get -- 30 day -- interview superior general 
society saint pius x. 
many catholics decide side pope . 

soundness , papacy infallible , eventually 
pope straighten . 
, hand , 
also , , short term , 
pope may indeed wrong , catholics nothing 
help situation obey wrong . 
fact , 
situation grave enough , sin obey . 

least , waste great opportunity , fail 
love christ heroic way time need 
badly . 
schism ... let 's move schism . 
? 
schism superset disobedience refusal obey legitimate 
command . 
schismatic disobedient . 
superset , 
work way around : 
schismatic . 
mere fact sspx priest comply 
holy father 's desire make schismatic . 
must add disobedience constitute 
schism ? 
maybe something else make sspx priest schismatic . 
must add : rejection right command . 
look 
decent reference catholic theology , 'll find : 
distinguish criterion schism rejection right 
command . 
catholic encyclopedia say , example : 
... every disobedience schism ; order possess 
character must include besides command 
superior , denial divine right command . 
ce article `` schism '' 
society saint pius x schismatic ? 
answer clear 
: say pope boss . 
pray every 
day . 
matter far schism go . 
boil : leave aside 
consideration exact nature objection , position 
legitimate one , far catholic theology obedience 
schism go . 
resist certain papal policy 
think clearly contrary traditional teaching 
papacy , best interest church . 
fact , someone 
find situation duty resist . 
, stance rome ? 
well , read 
holy father 's motu proprio `` ecclesia dei '' , find . 

definitive document subject . 
motu proprio specifically 
papal act . 
product roman congregation , letter 
pope possibly never even read . 
pope 
. 
boss god ... one else complain . 
document , holy father say , among thing : 
1 episcopal consecration perform archbishop lefebvre 
constitute schismatic act . 
2 archbishop lefebvre 's problem misunderstanding nature 
. 
confuse : fail see logic pope 's point . 
far episcopal consecration go , read interesting 
article translation italian magazine `` si si '' . 

get back question jurisdiction . 
episcopal 
consecration imply rejection pope 's jurisdiction , 
would truly constitute schismatic act , justify excommunication 
current code canon law . 
problem 
: accord traditional theology holy order , episcopal 
consecration confer jurisdiction . 
confer power 
order : ability sacraments . 
jurisdiction must 
confer someone else power confer 
pope . 
society bishop , know traditional theology quite 
well , take great pain avoid pretence jurisdiction 
anyone . 
simply confer sacrament require bishop . 
`` si si '' article interesting posit 
reason pope say novel , 
ii idea holy order . 
accord idea , 
episcopal consecration confer jurisdiction . 
lend article 
friend , unfortunately , tell . 
believe 
quote new code canon law support idea . 
pope 's thinking point remain great puzzle . 
way schism , accord traditional catholic 
theology . 
pope think ? 
far point regard nature tradition go , 's 
passage question : 
root schismatic act discern incomplete 
contradictory notion . 
incomplete , 
take sufficiently account live character 
tradition , , second vatican council clearly teach , 
come apostle progress church 
help holy spirit . 
growth insight 
reality word pass . 
come 
various way . 
come contemplation 
study believer ponder thing heart . 
come intimate sense spiritual reality 
experience . 
come preaching 
receive , along right succession 
, sure charism truth . 
especially contradictory notion tradition 
oppose universal magisterium church possess 
bishop rome body bishop . 
impossible 
remain faithful tradition break ecclesial bond 
, person apostle peter , christ 
entrust ministry unity church . 
papal motu proprio `` ecclesia dei '' , 2 july 1988 
seem holy father make two point 
simplify following : 
- vatican council ii happen . 
- pope . 
argument either case sufficient prove 
archbishop lefebvre must wrong , disagree . 
weak , say least ! 
would help clarify thing pope address 
archbishop lefebvre 's concern detail . 
john paul ii 's 
stand social kingship christ , teach gregory xvi , pius 
ix , leo xiii , pius xi pius xii , example ? 
suppose 
ignore pope say subject ? 
know future hold , power 
sspx still talk rome try straighten thing . 

many people would prefer call justified refusal obey 
`` justified disobedience '' even `` obey god rather man '' . 
call refusal obey obedience put sort alice 
wonderland world word mean whatever want mean . 
similarly , schism indicate formal break church . 
pope 
say schism exist , seem definition 
exist . 
may pope wrong side break , 
good reason break exist , 
shortly heal . 
one deny fact exist ? 
seem grave danger destroy thing 
try reform : power papacy . 
good 
become reconcile pope future , 
process , destroy ability use tool church 
discipline ? 
one thing hold pope misuse 
power , excommunicate someone wrongly . 
something else 
say excommunication take effect , schism 
imagination . 
mean act church discipline 
legal tool , act whose validity open debate . 
generally 
liberal catholics problem pope . 
often object church sanction , generally 
admit sanction exist . 
open door 
people simply ignore papal decision , claim truly 
obey disobey , communion excommunicate . 
would seem precisely denial divine right command 
say define schism .
