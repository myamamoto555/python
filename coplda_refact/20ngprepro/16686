another pair suggestion : 
1 . 
remove balk rule . 
runner responsibility stay `` safe '' 
matter pitcher . 
2 . 
pitcher throw occupied base x time x 3 5 
without successfully pick runner , runner advance base 
walk . 
last suggestion probably increase number steal basis 
considerably . 
suppose pitcher use n-1 n 
attempt . 
runner probably stretch lead base , 
give extra pressure pitcher get 
right time . 
would suggestion apply attempt per pitch , per 
batter , per base runner base ?
