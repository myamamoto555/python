well 48 bit color could improve resolution 16 bit per channel 
seem like bit excessive . 
see paper quote 10 bit per channel 
12 bit computational precision . 
would seem waste . 
perhaps frame buffer use another need bit 
represent full range - rgb cube compact encoding . 
likely however two separate 24 bit 8 bit per component 
frame buffer . 
set , call double buffer , allow complex 3d picture 
build one buffer buffer contain previous 
frame display . 
make smoother animation .

dec . 
sigh . 
well hey want brag number , 5000 range take turbo + 
card 96 bit per pixel . 
full double buffering two 24 bit buffer , 24 
bit z buffer extra 24 bit buffer screen image storage . 
mind card cost workstation .
