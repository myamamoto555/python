ahh , perhaps astronomer build 2 10-meter 
ground-based scope study design larger one . 
seriously , though , never go get 10-meter scope orbit 
cheaply build one ground , adaptive optics 
good site , difference quality narrow quite bit 
anyway . 
also , scope low orbit like hubble observe thing 
continuously ~ 45 minute time , serious 
limitation .

case , 
sure hell ` point light ' half degree extent 
bright moon . 
ever notice much brighter 
night sky moonlit night ?

exist satellite point light , advertising sign 
appear point would useless , rather think 
appear larger ` typical ' satellite . 
also , satellite track 
ruin lot plate current palomar sky survey .
