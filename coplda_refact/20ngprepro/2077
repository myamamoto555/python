would like see info well . 
wavelength , think 
primarily go find two - 880 nm + - bit , 950 nm 
+ - bit . 
usually 10 nm either way . 
two common 
see 880 950 also hear 890 940 . 
sure 10 nm one way another make great deal 
difference . 
another suggestion - find brand tv use ir remote , 
go look sam . 
often find 
detailed schematic part list receiver 
transmitter well , include carrier freq . 
spec . 
tone decoding 
spec . 
system use .
