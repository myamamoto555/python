eminent domain state-mandated transaction one party 
require sell piece property another party , 
regardless whether first party wish sell , price 
set state . 
fail see doctrine find 
tort , bankruptcy contract case general . 
well , okay , sort 
bankruptcy ...

bang . 
one place widely diverge . 
believe 
court , decide civil dispute two party , 
consider factor -- perhaps overriding factor -- issue 
believe court ignore irrelevant dispute . 
_ boomer v. atlantic cement co. _ action bring one party , 
boomer , whose property rights violate ongoing basis 
another party , atlantic cement company . 
fact support 
boomer 's contention atlantic cement wrongfully damaging 
property , boomer ask court order atlantic cement stop 
. 
end story . 
reason court consider 
issue capitalistic society would want atlantic cement 
whether cost compliance disproportionate damage 
face plaintiff . 
issue nothing case 
court .

okay judicial branch 
> interfere way , legislative executive branch ? 
would arm ? 
assume ? 
quite contrary , would 
probably support action , since would base general 
doctrine decision believe would correct 
_ boomer _ : idea people 's property rights violate 
reason economic efficiency . 
_ boomer _ boomer 's 
property rights believe court protect ; 
hypothetical epa ruling present , american people 's 
collective property rights healthy physical environment . 

good cost-benefit ratio 15 wind cement dust 
air ?

ted frank 

would per se illegal operate cement plant ? 
would 
mean buy land cement plant , would 
either buy enough land pollution would 
stay land , buy pollution easement surround 
landowner ?

yes . 
? 
court suppose protect specific rights 
individual , general interest nebulous society . 

society cement plant without violate anyone 's rights , 
fine . 
otherwise society somehow limp along one less 
cement plant . 
see , ted , really _ _ libertarian !

`` one want legal regime approximate end result begin , 
order minimize transaction cost . '' 
??? 
`` one '' 
speaking ? 
_ _ want legal regime protect people 's rights . 
besides , coase 's theorem real application 
land perfectly rational actor . 
real world 1 people 
go stubborn , ornery , spiteful otherwise `` irrational '' 
economic point view 2 purpose court 
protect right . 
care show logically 
cattle $ 100 damage property per head , 
rationally sell grazing rights land , say , $ 150 
per head -- still retain right tell plain 
want damned cattle property , price . 

say : `` everyone 's property rights protect ; 
plaintiff make whole ; unnecessary settlement cost 
avoid . '' 
, dispute claim plaintiff 
`` make whole . '' 
, fact , court action deprive 
rights owner property choose sell sell 
property price acceptable . 

> 
> , argument , tort plaintiff ever make whole , 
> award damages involuntary . 
treat nuisance 
> plaintiff different tort plaintiff ? 

> require specific performance analogous contractual situation ; 
> tort ? 
last question first : reason contract law -- 
would come dangerously close tread thirteenth 
amendment . 
`` , argument , tort plaintiff ever make 
whole , award damages involuntary '' claim , 
least partially right . 
face situation wrong 
already damage victim already take place 
reverse undo , court try set equitable 
price tag loss suffer victim require wrongdoer 
pay price rather inflated price victim might 
prefer . 
case , `` sale '' already take place 
irreversible , court simply try ensure fair price 
pay , doctrine certain circumstance 
even civil wrongdoer force pay punitive excessive price 
b even genuine victim profit unjustified 
inequitable manner victimhood . 
doctrine may 
worth discuss debate elsewhere , neither relevant case 
like _ boomer _ wrongful act loss stem 
still future _ _ i.e. , prevent 
happen order court . 
type case , court require 
potential victim 's property rights protect unless 
agree sell price . 
need 
court guess equitable value loss force 
side accept finding . 
leave operation 
party . 
ask : since court suppose 
business ensure `` unnecessary '' settlement cost avoid ? 
, -- always think court 
suppose business ensure justice . 
> 
> unnecessary settlement cost unjust punitive . 
case like _ boomer _ , simply cost business . 

fact proprietor atlantic cement co. get 
position find barrel simply 
result poor business decision start cement plant 
without _ first _ try negotiate boomer everyone else whose 
property rights would violate via operation plant . 
nothing punitive unjust . 
2 `` completely sensible '' believe allege 
right owner atlantic cement stay business avoid 
lose lot money due wrongful act , 
alleged right several hundred atlantic cement employee 
job disappear , trump rights people 
property damage atlantic cement 's wrongful act . 

> 
> anybody ever commit wrongful act disgorge entire 
> set possession wrong person ? 
complain 
> excess punitive damages ? 
anybody want commit wrongful act future 
require buy right victim , advance . 

seller allow set price privilege . 

injustice , punitive damages . 

> would like posner , bill . 
libertarian . 

really ? 
know ... , anything , say 
case like _ boomer _ ? 

> 
> eal , cite example bilateral monopoly court 
> correctly avoid . 
sure cover landes posner book 
> tort law , presumably favorably , book front 
> . 
sound much like libertarian . 
libertarian tend 
believe rights individual people , society . 

admit understanding field generally refer 
`` law economics '' weak . 
advocate use 
economical analysis one many `` tie-breaker '' factor 
court may use help reach decision case 
dispute , measure scale `` justice '' , evenly balanced , 
fine . 
illustrate _ boomer _ , _ _ fine 
court start view economics case important 
justice case . 

> 
> case justice case intricately tie 
> economics case . 
atlantic cement commit tort cause $ 
> damage . 
pay million ? 
compensate 
> damage commit ? 
state , tort _ ongoing _ . 
atlantic cement want 
able _ continue _ violate boomer 's rights . 
court may 
justified set equitable price tag damage already 
commit , reason need set price tag 
_ future _ violation boomer 's rights force boomer sell 
price .
