anyone info apparent sighting vulcan ? 

know apparently two sighting 
drastically different time small planet inside mercury 's

hear story , albert come theory 
warped space , nobody could account

run little fast think simple 
newtonian physics . 
success find neptune 
explain odd movment uranus , postulate 
might another inner planet explain mercury 's orbit . 
unlikely anything bigger asteroid closer 
sun mercury . 
sure would spot . 
perhaps professional confirm .
