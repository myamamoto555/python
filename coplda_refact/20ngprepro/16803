valid true . 
add 
, individual detector also build fail-safe , 
detector read background radiation i.e. cosmic ray , 
remember right , detector go 3 5 sigma 
background . 
catch particularly energetic cosmic ray 
would normally set . 
even buffer , still throw 
something like burst get , earth 's 
van allen belts , south atlantic anomaly , sun , remember right , 
either radar station , radio station australia , 
couple source well .
