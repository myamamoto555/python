canada . 
far fewer shooting like . 

, believe , one mass murder last twenty year . 

go say gun problem . 

world 's largest undefended boarder one country 
world . 
think canada illustrate gun control 
effect . 
fact , suprise difference consider 
easy smuggle gun u.s. 

yes , amazing , . 
fact , tell gun control 
reason crime rate low , since idiot smuggle gun 
canada us time .

> stricter gun control law deterrent effect . 
seem strange argument make consider canada 's 
violent crime rate general far lower u.s. 
crime rate greater entire crime rate . 

would seem strange suggest , , result gun 
control law . 
think look would find specific cultural 
enforcement reason rate low well , 
reason could apply rate easily . 
> give 
> criminally use gun either legally purchase steal 
> purchase legally , restriction legal possession 
> seem effect reduce crime . 
aside fact find idea punish 
somebody might steal something go commit 
crime silly solution , still address 
question canada . 
, way , blame rise 
rate u.s. strange border use `` magically '' 
keep gun , . 
> certainly make 
> sense would . 
well , make sense , anyway . 
; - 
side coin , course , far `` illegal drug '' 
purchase legally steal people purchase legally . 
still convince gun , commodity criminal 
show perfectly willing pay illegal source 
steal either police , military , civilian would simply 
see south american source drug come start smuggling gun 
well , since thrive gun manufacturing industry . 
would look little closer crime statistics , would 
realize : 
- crime rate also high , gun per se issue

rate roughly city . 

> difference violent crime rate almost totally . 
point study , critique 
, two seperate article james wright david kopel come 
mind point difference also almost 
entirely minority related . 
, gun crime rate skyrocket 
poor minority blacks hispanics primarily 
compare white majority identical . 
problem nejm study compare minority vs. 
percentage fail take account relative 
condition minority . 
percentage 
far go . 
fail take 
account non-whites either city live 
condition . 
situation entirely base availability gun , 
would expect white rate , two group 
arguably fairly comparative two city , would far 
higher rate seattle . 
yet majority seattle 
significantly higher minority exclude , slightly 
lower . 
- violent crime highly concentrate inner city

pick area highest incidence poverty , drug use , disease , 
> etc. . 
since rate lower suburbia , middle class folk ignore 
> problem . 
point , course , many u.s. `` inner-city '' 
problem mirror canada . 
condition 
significantly different canada u.s. , violent 
crime highly correlate area , suggest gun control 
source canada 's low rate highly questionable . 
one 
canadian point , canada 's major gun control 
1978 result either reduction slowing increase 
violent crime rate , rise steadily since . 
apparently 
even mirror large drop violent crime 
early eighty . 
- violent crime occur area strict gun control already 
> 
> post hoc ergo propter hoc . 
area implement gun control 
> high rate . 
true certain extent . 
take washington d.c. , 
gun control institute crime problem true , 
crime proceed explode afterwards . 
similarly new york . 
question simply point time crime high 
low . 
gun control significantly positively impact 
violent crime . 
since go area , often faster 
go , simply dismiss high crime rate 
say gun control cause . 
yes , gun control may institute 
deal high crime . 
crime positively impact , 
continually say crime rate entirely cause 
gun control , since much crime rate increase gun control 
implement , happen canada . 
> similar worse rate exist city poor gun control . 
would expect violent crime generally independent 
gun control . 
> jury still question whether recent tough law 
> washington d.c. may alleviate violence suicide rate . 
would law make manufacturer liable 
gun , suddenly police find nobody would 
sell ?
