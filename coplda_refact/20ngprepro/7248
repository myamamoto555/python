simply avoid

think lee lady talk cross purpose . 
, lady seem concern contrast great 
science make big advance knowledge mediocre 
science make smaller step . 
thread , 
concern difference science 
. 
lee lady correct assert difference 
einstein average post-doc physicist quality 
think . 
difference einstein 
genius would great scientist whose great thought 
scientifically screwy ? 
would give velikovsky 
korzybski example . 
like , choose 
. 
say difference mediocre 
physicist mediocre proponent . 
einstein 
mediocre discipline work 
cumulative knowledge previous researcher go wrong . 
velikovsky mediocre proponent fail 
. 
let approach second direction . 
one ask 
review paper journal conference , many 
kind criticism one make . 
one kind criticism 
work wrong misinformed . 
another kind 
criticism work , technically correct , either 
important interesting . 
first difference 
one point . 
second difference 
one lee lady seem discuss . 
> good empirical research show merit 
> homeopathic remedy , would certainly valuable information . 
> would still mean homeopathy qualify science . 

> disagree turpin . 
often point homeopathy consider 
scientific , need test theoretical claim , 
propose remedy . 
similarly , suspect 
traditional chinese medicine many remedy work ; 
lack one example experiment test 
presence . 
> ... order science , one must theoretical 
> structure make sense , mere collection empirically 
> validate random hypothesis . 
certainly `` theoretical structure make sense '' goal . 
area yet , see nothing wrong 
form test smaller hypothesis . 
let 's face : 
always wait einstein come along make everything 
clear . 
sometimes einstein 
plug along make small amount progress best .
