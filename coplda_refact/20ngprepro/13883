would nice know 
front company use intelligence agency 
u.s. government . 
, chip design examine verify 
silicon insure trap door hide protocol exist silicon , 
regardless security level encryption algorithm . 

proof chip role someone 
proper knowledge interrogate via communication link . 
design examination gate level . 
also , one 
verify look reflect , mask ? 
silicon examine well , design hand clean room 
publicly define clipper chip merge another design later , 
change completion mask . 
little proof 
tell chip chip . 
put verify mask escrow , use chip production , 
use third escrow party program chip . 
government ask lot blind trust : encryption algorithm , 
operate protocol , agency physical control device , 
silicon implementation . 
government trustworthy , escrow 
anything ?
