okay , go back look : sure enough , hunch right . 
2 peter likely write 100-120 a.d. 
revelation almost certainly write a.d. 
odds gospel john write around 90 a.d. 
best date luke act around 80 a.d. , maybe later . 
, footnote information new american bible , 
best translation come across regard give complete 
historical information book .

course folk argue almost certainly 
accept 2 peter pseudonymous . 
case would 
date far earlier .
