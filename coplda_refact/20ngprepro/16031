refer term `` effeminate '' `` homosexual '' 
passage , agree accuracy translation 
challenge . 
however , simply comment charge 
`` incredibly perverse '' interpretation read 
condemnation homosexuality . 
charge seem imply 
reasonable person would ever conclude verse paul 
intend condemn homosexuality ; however , think see 
reasonable person might well take view verse . 
therefore believe `` incredibly perverse '' read 
way . 
> think argument fornication circular . 

> homosexuality wrong ? 
fornication . 

> fornication ? 
marry . 
marry ? 
> church refuse marriage ceremony .

actually , think church . 
, couple 
marry minister . 
secular justice 
peace could job , two people would marry . 
point 
easy find biblical basis heterosexual 
marriage , bible would one get christian marriage 
two people sex ? 
see biblical 
basis same-sex marriage , willing would gay christian 
`` save '' marriage never sexual 
intercourse anyone outside marriage relationship ? 
please 
note try imply gay christian would 
willing monogamous , genuinely interested hearing 
opinion subject . 
hear comment gay past 
lead believe regard promiscuity one main 
point homosexual , yet tend doubt gay want 
christian would advocate position . 
gay view ? 
- mark 
yes , agree reasonable person might conclude paul 
condemn homosexuality .

post .

respects .
