well , difference . 
happen sae manual handy , oil viscosity general 
_ decrease _ temperature . 
sae number base ` typical ' 
curve oils use , run say viscosity 
room-temperature 0c , say room-temperature 
20c , typical oil . 
oils design operation ` normal ' temperature 
weight specification . 
oils design operation exceedingly 
cold temperature ` w ' tack end , winter cold 
place , would stick 10w car winter 40 summer , 
approximate appropriate viscosity throughout year . 
modern oils change viscosity much less temperature . 
result , viscosity graph cross several curve . 

specification peg curve two temperature , ` normal ' operating 
temperature ` cold ' one though remember number ... . 
event , weight indicate significant difference . 
remember 
engine thermostat 
radiator air fin time -- unless overheat 
something . 
weight oil better oil , old , 
oil . 
thin oil general lubricate well temperature , 
thicker oil like lubricate better temperature , 
well startup , engine wear occur . 
plan make long drive , probably fine 
esp . 
summer car . 
make short drive , 
stick .

drink soap ! 
dilute dilute ! 
ok !
