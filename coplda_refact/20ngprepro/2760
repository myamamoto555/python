jason smith write : 

: discussion begin : universe exist ? 

: one law nature , specify cause effect seem dictate 
: least layman 's mind must causal event . 

: reasonable alternative exist . 

would argue causality actually property spacetime ; 
cause precede effect . 
must concede . 
cause effect , imply time , time part 
spacetime . 
, argument would valid . 
could return say 
infer cause effect relationship unique 
spacetime , 8 ^ , point moot . 

address petri address . 
also concede doubly remiss , assert `` reasonable 
alternative exist '' , entirely subjective statement part one 
could invalidate , give time discovery 
scientist . 
also understand prove theory necessarily 
specify `` happen '' , propose likely description 
phenomenon question . 
mistake understanding ? 
claim must 
answer `` '' universe spacetime emerge 
`` nothing '' , science good candidate answer . 
require something christian readily admit : `` faith '' . 
fact several candidate belie none conclusive . 
conclusive evidence , leave faith . 
could even argue one hypothesis may one day prove 
best event `` prove '' . 
ask , hold 
someone today belief correct , except 
faith ? 
couple paragraph delete . 
summary : ask `` 
universe exist '' 
think question actually split two part , namely 

1 existence ? 
anything exist ? 



2 universe emerge nothing ? 

clear science nothing say first question . 
however , 
meaningful question , ? 

would say . 
consider following : 
apparently many person . 
hence , religion . 
question `` anything exist '' counter 
demand answer question `` nothing nothingness , 
non-existence '' . 
actually , question turn 
devoid meaning . 
thing exist , thing exist 
exist . 
tautology best . 
carefully examine original question , `` '' . 
first ask `` '' , second request definition . 

address something exist , ask define 
lack existence . 
second question unanswerable indeed , 
identify something `` nothing '' mutually exclusive 
term ? 
. 
identify state non-existence , 
near limit simple layman 's ability comprehend , 
would appreciate explanation . 
might add , worldview `` thing exist , thing 
... '' ground realm , 
theist 's belief god . 
base assumption 
reason , something ultimately 
un supportable position reason . 

foundation exist soil one claim 
reason . 
come . 
either `` , therefore . '' 
, `` reason . '' 
former satisfactory answer , , 
satisfied , need doctor . 
latter , search 
begin . 
seriously doubt god could answer question . 
time tell . 
8 ^ 

christian talk say actually , god 
existence . 
however , see several problem 
answer . 
first , inevitably lead conclusion god 
actually _ _ existence , good evil , devil angel , 
. 
pantheism , christianity . 
agreed . 
would lead question definition christianity 
well . 
another answer god _ source _ existence . 
sound much better , tempt ask : god 
exist , ? 
god source existence , 
mean , term human time , always 
exist . 
source existence . 
preclude existence . 
seek identify 
quality imply exist quality , btw . 
best answer hear human reasoning incapable 
understand question . 
atheist , 
accept answer , since method . 
like theist , come statement faith , position assume 
evidence hand conclusive . 
note , argue 
scientific endeavor , science useful understand universe 
exist . 
differ atheist matter perspective . 

seek understand exist understand appreciate art 
creator . 
also discover science inadequate tool answer `` '' . 

appear m. agree shall see . 
tool 
inadequate answer question preclude question . 
assert 
` ' invalid question provide answer . 
: far tell , law nature demand `` '' . 

: true something outside nature i.e. , super natural . 

true . 
science collection model tell `` '' , 
, something happen . 
see good reason `` '' 
question would bind natural thing , assume 
supernatural domain exist . 
supernatural exist , 
appropriate ask ask exist . 
apology . 
use `` come '' . 

pre-existence become existence . 
become spacetime . 
come admission science fail answer `` ? '' 
. 

answer realm modern science , make 
question invalid ? 
: believe 
: technology would able produce necessary spark life , despite 
: part available . 
opinion . 

opinion also call vitalism ; namely , live system 
somehow _ fundamentally _ different inanimate system . 
christian 
general adopt position ? 
would happen scientist announce 
create primitive life say , small bacterium lab ? 
suppose would thing galileo 
vindicate someone start jump scream 
`` inquisition ! '' 
, note say vindicate . 
certainly hope get 
beyond `` shoot messenger '' stage . 
m. present good point though . 
may need ask `` 
individual christian base faith ? '' 
shake 
production evidence shatter `` sacred cow '' seek 
understand new discovery truly disagree god say 
continue say word ? 
`` ask ? ''
