look algorithm article virtual sound . 
want 
follow ; 
fast source , eg . 
cdrom , several sound source read , 
define position attribute , eg . 
direction etc. . 
give 
listener position direction , sum sound play back 
listener earphone function position direction . 

means simulation ear color sound relative 
incoming direction sound source . 
think 
possible lookup table impulse response several angle 
relative ear , interpolate impulse function give 
angle . 
impulse function could sound 
source . 
impulse function must change every time sound source 
change position listener change orientation . 
additionally 
reflection , diffusion due environment wich define 
could simulated , require sort sound 
simulation , kinda like radiosity algorithm . 
someone write article implement system ? 
please post mail answer comment .
