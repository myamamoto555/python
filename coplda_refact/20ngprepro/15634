crossbows cryptography : thwarting state via 
technology 
give future freedom conference , november 1987 
know , technology -- particularly computer 
technology -- often get bad rap libertarian cir -

though government certainly use technology oppress , 
evil lie tool wielder tool . 
fact , technology represent one promis -

two better word de - 
scribe government bureaucracy `` dull '' `` sluggish '' ? 
one clearest , classic triumph technology 
tyranny see invention man-portable 
crossbow . 
, untrained peasant could reliably 
lethally engage target fifty meter -- even 
target mount , knight . 
unlike 
longbow , , admittedly powerful , could 
get shot per unit time , crossbow require 
formal training utilize . 
whereas longbow require 
elaborate visual , tactile kinesthetic coordination 
achieve degree accuracy , wielder crossbow 
could simply put weapon shoulder , sight along 
arrow , reasonably assure hit tar - 
get . 
moreover , since mount knight 
likely visit average peasant would government 
soldier tax collector , utility device

make development , 
call `` public-key '' cryptography , '' 
openly publish product pq number x , 
keep secret number y -- anyone send 
encrypted message , namely 
x 
mod pq , 
recover original message , take 
send , raise power y take 
result mod pq . 
risky step meeting exchange cipher 
key eliminate . 
people may even trust 
enough want meet , may still reliably ex -

normally , want send message , 
raise plaintext x take result mod 
pq send . 
however , message , take plaintext 
raise secret power y , take result mod 
pq , raise result x mod pq 
send , even normally `` decrypt '' 
message , still look like garbage . 
however , 
raise public power x , take result 
mod public pq , recover orus - 
plaintext message , know one 
could send since one else know secret 
y .

free - 
dom contract beyond certain minimum extent , state 
warp fabric political continuum

impossible . 
good illustration see 
area so-called `` welfare '' payment . 

sup public trough outnumber thus outvote 
whose tax must replenish trough , possible 
choice democracy perpetuate expand tak - 
ing unearned benefit many ? 
go 
nearest `` welfare '' office , find two people 
dole ... recognize form 
voting bloc forever outvote question 
life -- fruit life 's labor . 
essentially love liberty need `` edge '' 
sort ultimately go prevail . 
- 
use altruist ' `` '' 
`` work , slave , suffer , sacrifice , next generation 
billion random stranger live better world . '' 
recognize , however immoral appeal might , 
nonetheless extremely powerful one today 's culture . 
convince people work energetically 
`` cause , '' care enough personal welfare 
remain alive enough healthy enough continue 
work -- truly massive reservoir energy 
draw . 
equally clearly , sort ap - 
peal utilize egoistic 
libertarian goal . 
stand tonight 
say something like , `` listen , follow enunciate 
noble `` cause , '' contribute money support `` cause , '' 
give free time work `` cause , '' strive 
selflessly bring , 
child dead maybe child 's child actu - 
ally live egoism '' -- would think would go mad . 

course would right . 
point try 
make libertarianism egoism spread , 
, , individual libertarian egoist find 
profitable enjoyable . 
probably 
. 
certainly disparage concept polus - 
tical action , believe , even 
necessarily cost-effective path toward increase 
freedom time . 
consider , fraction 
investment time , money effort might expend try - 
ing convince state abolish wiretapping 
form censorship -- teach every libertarian - 
use cryptography abolish 
unilaterally . 
maxim -- proverb -- generally attribute 
, likely libertarians al - 
ready hear . 
likely would quarrel 
say , might well feel hear often 
enough already , nothing teach , 
moreover , maybe even tire hear . 

shall therefore repeat : 
give man fish , say run , feed 
day . 
teach man fish , feed 
lifetime . 
exposure quote probably sort 
`` workfare '' vs. `` welfare '' context ; namely , 
genuinely wish help someone need , teach 
earn sustenance , simply beg . 
course true , next time 
hungry , might anybody around willing even 
able give fish , whereas information 
fish , completely self sufficient . 
submit exhaust first order 
content quote , nothing 
glean , would waste time cite 
. 
, seem almost 
slant , though imply structure ac - 
maximize benefit hungry 
beggar may encounter . 
consider : 
suppose eskimo know fish , 
know hunt walrus . 
, hand , 
often go hungry travel thru walrus country 
idea catch damn thing , 
eat fish could catch . 
suppose 
two decide exchange information , bartering 
fishing knowledge hunting knowledge . 
well , first 
thing observe transaction type 
categorically unambiguously refute marxist premise 
every trade must `` winner '' `` loser ; '' 
idea one person gain , must necessarily 
`` expense '' another person lose . 
clearly , 
scenario , case . 
party gain - 
thing , neither - 
ish way . 
come exchange information 
rather material object life longer zero-sum 
game . 
extremely powerful notion . 
`` law 
diminish return , '' `` first second law 
thermodynamics '' -- `` law '' constrain - 
bility context -- longer bind ! 

anarchy ! 
consider another possibility : suppose hungry 
eskimo never learn fish ruler 
nation-state decree fishing illegal . 
fish 
contain dangerous tiny bone , sometimes sharp spine , 
tell , state decree consumption -- 
even possession -- hazardous people 's 
health permit ... even knowledgeable , willing 
adult . 
perhaps citizen ' body think 
government property , therefore function 
state punish improperly care govern - 
ment property . 
perhaps state gener - 
extend competent adult `` benefit '' provide 
child mentally ill : namely , full-time , 
supervisory conservatorship -- need 
trouble make choice behavior 
think physically risky morally `` naughty . '' 
, 
case , stare stupefied , eskimo informant re - 
late law take seriously friend 
recently imprison year crime `` pos - 
session nine ounce trout intent distribute . '' 
may conclude society grotesquely 
oppressive enforce law type simply 
affront dignity human . 
may go far - 
ther decide commit portion discretion - 
ary , recreational time specifically task thwart 
tyrant 's goal . 
rationale may `` altruistic '' 
sense want liberate oppressed , 
`` egoistic '' sense prove outsmart 
oppressor -- likely combination per - 
hap even motive . 
, since zero desire become martyr 
`` cause , '' mount military campaign , 
even try run boatload fish blockade . 
however , technology -- particular - 
formation technology -- multiply efficacy literally 
hundredfold . 
say `` literally , '' fraction 
effort virtually none risk attendant 
smuggling hundred fish , quite readily produce 
hundred xerox copy fishing instruction . 
tar - 
gete government , like present-day america , least permit 
open discussion topic whose implementation re - 
strict , suffice . 
, government 
attempt suppress flow information well , 
take little effort perhaps write 
fishing manual floppy disk encrypted accord 
mythical eskimo 's public-key parameter . 
far 
increase real-world access fish make genuine 
nonzero headway -- may continue snowball 
information provide . 

waste time try convert id - 
adversary , even try win unde - 
cide . 
recall harry browne 's dictum `` freedom 
unfree world '' success endeavor general 
inversely proportional number people whose - 
sion necessary fulfilment . 
look history , deny 
dramatically shape man name like washington , 
lincoln , . 
. 
. 
nixon . 
. 
. 
marcos ... duvalier ... 
... ilk . 
also shape 
people name like edison , curie , marconi , tesla 
wozniak . 
latter shaping least per - 
, nearly bloody . 
try take 
project . 
rather beseech state please en - 
slave , plunder constrain , propose libertarian net - 
work spread technology may seize 
freedom . 
must bit careful . 

present illegal encrypt information government 
want spy , guarantee fu - 
ture may hold . 
bill introduce , exam - 
ple , would make crime wear body armor 
government want shoot . 
, 
commit certain crime wear kevlar vest , 
fact would constitute separate federal crime . 
law knowledge pass ... yet ... 
indicate government think . 
technological application , however , indeed 
pose legal risk . 
recognize , example , anyone 
help pre-civil war slave escape `` underground 
railroad '' make clearly illegal use technology -- 
sovereign government united states america 
time find buying selling human quite 
acceptable buying selling cattle . 
simi - 
, prohibition , anyone use bathtub 
ferment yeast sugar illegal psychoactive drug , 
alcohol -- controlled substance , wine -- use - 
way could get shoot dead federal agent 
`` crime '' -- unfortunately restore life 
congress reverse use 
drug . 
... quote former president , co - 
conspirator pardon felon ... `` let make one thing 
perfectly clear : '' project advocate , 
participate , conspire violation law -- 
matter oppressive , unconstitutional simply stupid 
law may . 
engage description - 
tional informational purpose technological 
process , process like fly plane 
manufacture firearm may well require appropriate li - 
perform legally . 
fortunately , license 
need distribution receipt information - 
self . 
, next time look political scene 
despair , think , `` well , 51 % nation 51 % 
state , 51 % city turn libertarian 
'll free , somebody might well cut 
goddamn throat , put misery '' -- recognize 
case . 
exist way make - 
self free . 
wish explore technique via project , 
welcome give name address -- fake 
name mail drop , matter -- 'll go 
mailing list newsletter . 

friend acquaintance think would interested 
welcome well . 
even ask stamped self - 
address envelope , since printer handle mailing la - 
bel actual postage cost noise compare 
effort get issue . 

idea share , even useful product 
plug , 'll glad write publication . 
even want proverbial `` free rider '' 
benefit contribute -- still welcome : 
everything public domain ; feel free copy 
give away sell , matter , 'cause 
get money take full-page ad try 
give away , certainly entitle capitalist 
profit ... anyway , every application principle 
make world little freer , certainly 
willing underwrite , least forseeable fu -

leave one final thought : 
learn beat plowshare sword 
outlaw sword , sure hell ought learn 
outlaw plowshare .
