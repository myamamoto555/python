hey folk , 
fairly new group , tho ' hear . 
would like get comment question mind 
lot : apply dream out-of-body incident ? 
normal dream , control anything , obviously 
morally responsible action . 
contrive 
control action dream , seem like morality apply . 
, seem 3 alternative : 
1 dream totally mental phenomenon . 
case morality 
apply beyond might call ` mental hygiene ' , , try 
think anything evil , overly sexy violent 
thought . 
2 dream reality i.e. ` another plane ' 
evidence often dream sometimes 
common one person . 

mark objective fact > 1 people report objective experience . 
case , interpersonal apply dream 
wake life . 
3 like 2 , assume though environs 
real existence , different apply , maybe 
different moral law apply . 
... . 
one case truth , anyone know 
another alternative ? 
respond post email . 
thanks much
