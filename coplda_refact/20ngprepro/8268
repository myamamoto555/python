depend priority . 
lot people put higher priority 
gas mileage cost safety , buy `` unsafe '' econobox 
instead volvos . 
personally take middle ground -- 
thing really look three-point seatbelt 5 + mph bumper . 
figure collision brick wall common enough 
spend much extra money protection , 
lot low-speed collision worry .
