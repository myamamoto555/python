limited detail release far , seem clipper chip 
system must employ sort public key cryptography . 
otherwise , key 
management problem inherent cipher would make system 
unworkable . 
probably sort public key exchange take place 
start call . 
thats would identify private key 
datum base ? 
mean either nsa develop non rsa public key 
fed decide subsidize pkp & . 
former 
rather exciting since keep secret make 
chip widely exceptionally hard . 
fed 
force make order gain public acceptance 
could break rsa 's stranglehold public key crypto u.s. 
impression whole scheme seem instead try 
ban strong crypto , try co-opt . 
contention 
need keep secret protect security key 
registration suggest possible inherent weakness . 
likely 
dont want anyone construct black market device dont 
key register . 
anyone else notice q&a session , 
talk release key people proper 
carefully dance around state key simply . 
seem try keep open obtain key without 
court order even though tap phone line require one . 
also pick 
implicit threat accept 'll ban strong crypto outright ? 
dont trust plan plan oppose legal way 
possible .
