ok , doug right , would obstruction justice , blah blah blah ,

view _ _ think `` lawfulness '' good 
admittedly people . 
even better way . 
provide government prosecute criminally , probably 
plead fifth thus legally avoid reveal key . 

government demand information criminal defendant `` may 
tend incriminate '' defendant . 
though never apply 
cryptography context least far tell seem 
obvious application .
