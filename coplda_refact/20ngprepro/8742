information 
sure condition `` recognize '' anywhere 
sense disease diagnostic criterion , clear boundary 
disease , unique pathologic physiologic 
feature , etc , go many neurologist agree . 
post-polio syndrome patient evidence motor neuron disease 
clinical examination , emg , muscle biopsy . 
abnormality 
mostly chronic due old polio evidence 
ongoing deterioration . 
clinically , patient complain 
decline strength endurance everyday motor task . 
musculoskeletal pain nearly universal feature doubtless 
contribute impaired performance . 
examination show 
muscle weakness atrophy . 
emg show evidence old 
denervation reinnervation giant long-duration motor unit 
action potential evidence active denervation 
fibrillation potential . 
biopsy also show old denervation 
reinnervation grouping evidence active 
denervation small , angulated fiber dense oxidative enzyme 
staining - curiously , little group atrophy . 
post-polio patient als . 
als , clinically 
evident deterioration one month next . 
post-polio , 
patient remarkably stable objective finding one 
year next . 
course , patient polio 
develop genuine als , als common among 
polio survivor among people never polio . 
cause post-polio syndrome unknown . 
little 
evidence post-polio patient active polio virus 
destructive immunologic response virus antigen . 
solid evidence patient post-polio 
anything different happen motor unit anterior horn cell , 
motor axon , neuromuscular junction , muscle fiber 
patient old polio complain deterioration . 
group emg biopsy finding . 
reason 
`` acute '' change `` chronic '' disease old polio 
unknown . 
possibly spinal motor neuron huge 
number muscle fiber start shed load several 
year . 
couple clinical feature distinguish post-polio 
syndrome patient patient old polio deny 
deterioration . 
pp patient likely severe 
polio . 
pp patient much likely complain pain . 
also tend score higher depression scale 
test . 
take sure disagree : recovery 
severe polio abnormal load muscle , tendon , 
ligament , bone , joint , lead inflammatory 
degenerative condition affect structure . 
increase 
pain , superimpose chronic unchanging weakness , lead 
progressive impairment motor performance adl . 

perhaps bias personal experience never see pp 
patient limit way pain . 
believe 
pp patient rapid deterioration motor unit 
patient i.e. , old polio similar severity 
without pps complaint .
