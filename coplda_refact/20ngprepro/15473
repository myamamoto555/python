yes , two sens interpretation , certainly 
decision accept scripture inspired ultimately rest 
private opinion . 
however , read scripture , remember 
scriptures give god instruction , 
interpretation matter one god intend . 
example , 
decide fact john baptist elijah teach 
doctrine reincarnation , wrong intend 
interpretation . 
prophet make teaching ; come 
god , must accept . 
necessarily mean 
private interpretation must take back seat meaning god 
intend convey . 
certainly must rely best effort 
determine meaning , fact make 
recognize private interpretation automatically 
accept infallible interpretation god . 
need test 
spirit see god . 
holy spirit speak , 
say thing ; tell passage mean one 
thing tell mean another . 
two come 
conflict conclusion , completely right . 
know 
interpretation reliable church whole 
agree scripture mean . 
know doctrine 
trinity , dual nature christ , etc. infallibly . 

matter private interpretation . 
reason peter go talk 
false teacher . 
prefer private interpretation 
god-given teaching apostle . 
private 
interpretation tradition man , soundly denounce 
scripture , start .
