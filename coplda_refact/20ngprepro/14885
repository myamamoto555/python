yes , philosophy weak atheism worthless . 
true 
exactly sense philosophy christian ' disbelief 
zeus worthless . 
atheist construct personal philosophy 
many different source , build idea 
way christian build idea thunderbolt . 
atheists base philosophy atheism christian 
base nonexistence zeus . 
`` weak atheist '' position logically extremely -- 
logical demonstration existence god completely destroy 
soon demonstration make presence give weak 
atheist . 
atheist newsgroup barrage regularly 
attempt provide logical demonstration , fail 
miserably .

present favor particular god date proven unsound ; 
therefore , one say god argue argument 
exist . 
apply philosopher ' god
