interstellar grain close blackbody . 
`` large '' 
grain size order 0.1 micron absorb visible light 
fair efficiency . 
however , temperature 100 k , 90 % 
thermal emission beyond 22 micron , radiate 
efficiency poor . 
small antenna easily radiate long 
wavelength . 
thus grain must heat order radiate 
energy absorb . 
moreover , iras observation maximum wavelength 100 
micron . 
grain colder 30 k radiate primarily longer 
wavelength , ira would relatively insensitive . 

extreme limit , grain cold 5 k almost undetectable 
conceivable observation . 
worse still , iras color temperature heavily contaminate 
population `` small '' grain . 
grain perhaps 50 
atom , hit single photon heat 
temperature several hundred 1000 k. course cool 
quickly stay cold , _ radiate _ 
characteristic temperature several hundred k. even small 
population grain dramatically raise observe 
`` average '' temperature . 
model local infrared emission consistent cobe datum 
three component . 
represent scattered radiation zodiacal 
dust color temperature 5500 k , thermal emission zodiacal dust 
tc 280 k , thermal emission galactic dust tc 25 k . 

ecliptic pole , emissivity dilution factor 
respectively , , . 
first two roughly 
double ecliptic plane . 
find thermal equilibrium temperature , add dilution 
factor time fourth power temperature component , 
take fourth root . 
table , starlight come 
allen 's number stellar emission whole sky equivalent 
460 zero mag star color 0.75 . 
doubt careful work 
could much better . 
person suggest starlight 
dilution factor e-4 must remember wrong . 
would 
cook case . 
event , energy density 
starlight come microwave 
background , believe correct . 
dilution temp . 
dt ^ 4 
microwave background 1 2.7 53 
galactic dust 25 8 
zodiacal dust emission 280 369 
zodiacal dust scattering 5500 275 
starlight 5500 92 
----- 
797 
fourth root 797 5.3 k. outside solar system , 
result would 3.5 k. 
find result surprising , especially importance 
zodiacal dust , see serious mistake .
