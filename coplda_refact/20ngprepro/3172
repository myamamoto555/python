`` face '' ? 
possibly . 
however , face attacker 
common : stab without warn 
usual tactic . 
criminal shoot cover : attract 
much attention chance go 
pocket . 
overall , would much rather threaten gun 
actually stab knife . 
> ... fortunately , best defense knife

anyone train unarmed self-defense

> assault probably mean 99.9 % knife assailant . 
actually , exact statement true gun : training 
unarmed self-defence let disarm untrained gunman 
without much problem . 
also ignore criminal 's reaction : national crime 
survey clearly show criminal unarmed , arm 
knife , gun whatever unwilling risk life 
confrontation . 
face serious threat , almost 
prefer leave find easier target . 
therefore , 
use threaten use , much commonly case 
weapon _ _ best defense attacker , regardless 
arm . 
knife , however , much less effective 
gun : criminal consider knife `` serious threat '' 
nearly often gun .
