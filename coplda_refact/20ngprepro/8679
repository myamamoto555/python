proper way , imo . 
`` sport '' 
mode entail ? 
several thing : 
1 rev red line rev limiter case legacy 
2 delay upshift . 
i.e. lift briefly , remain 
low gear . 
handy charge corner 
would like without distraction upshift 
another curve approach 
3 part throttle downshift , base speed pedal 
depressed , rather position pedal . 
modern 
electronics measure easily switch sport mode . 
wonderful want charge green light 
turn red . 
sens well downshift 
little half throttle right foot fast enough . 
also , think smart automatic deliver better gas mileage 
dumb driver stick , else equal . 
. 
remember 
idea stick economical automatic make 
big assumption driver smart enough know gear 
use situation . 
. 
many time ride 
inattentive driver cruise highway 4th gear 
5 speed ? 
many % people drive manual really know best 
gear use every conceivable situation ? 
sure 
know , suspect chip control automatic 
possible combination store rom likely 
better . 
also say previous assumption prove 
wrong get car instantaneous mpg readout ... high gear , 
low rev wide open throttle economical low gear , high 
rev small throttle opening . 
explanation quite simple
