um , surely intend compare '93 red 
29 's . 
yankees finishing 2nd 
team good 26-28 yankees , 
yankees age peak year . 
ruth gehrig 
could play every position simultaneously . 
imo , give various age braves red season , 
braves closer peak , red 
slightly pass peak . 
also , go compare braves yankees , appropriate 
comparison '93 braves might yankees . 
fall short two year row exciting world series , 
team win series year , despite 
heroics old fart team .
