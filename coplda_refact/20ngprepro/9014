heh heh ... post read clinton chip message . 
. 
guess beat . 
. 
anyway , think would great idea 
develop product , perhaps underground , would otherwise 
probably become illegal pretty quickly ... 
really feasible expensive - need 
box phone jack one side , dsp middle codec 
function speech - > compress , rs232 side . 
would plug phone , plug rs232 computer , 
good old fashion normal modem rs232 port . 
cpu 
middle would encryption version pgp modify work 
byte stream . 
better modem carry , work . 
quality would marginally lower normal telephone . 
highest price , could use one voice-mail compatible 
modem digitisation - put upper bind $ 500 
cost box . 
practice , really ought able get 
price well $ 100 - could software cheap & nasty 
home risc box acorn archimedes digitise microphone buy 
25 pound , know write good speech compression software 
. 
reason work course hardly anyone one - 
consumer equipment encryption use wiretap chip . 
economics , afraid . 
however ... get throughput internet even 
bottleneck modem . 
get isdn ha ha ha 
new , might trivial run compress speech 
connection internet . 
perhaps start 
think standard keep voice internet compatible 
everyone , clipper stuff use internet 
phone call future joking
