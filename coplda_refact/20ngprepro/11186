larry - 
thanks reply , quite thing . 
like say , 
understand non-christian would deny access holy 
ceremony , ceremony communion secret . 
fact , 
four gospel record first `` breaking bread '' detail . 
communion fellowship meal , still , 
opinion inappropriate invite share fellowship 
body christ . 
fact unbeliever , deny access communal 
meal , begin imagine sort secret debased ritual 
communion means imply early christian fact 
hide shameful thing general public . 
fact , think read 
early church father , find 
bashful describe go communion . 
seem 
funny mormons , claim true restoration 1st 
century christianity , insist hide certain ritual grounds 
`` sacred . '' 
- mark 
actually , quite case . 
john omit central element 
last supper . 
gospel full symbolism bread 
wine . 
actual story . 
people think 
omit detail talk 
public community . 
also evidence aspect 
baptismal practice keep secret . 
see morton smith 's `` secret 
gospel '' -- agree lurid speculation 
secret practice actually , seem 
evidence mark omit certain detail 
inappropriate publication .
