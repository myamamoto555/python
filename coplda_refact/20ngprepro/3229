paul , 
unfortunately , many retail outlet 'll stock 
every chip make . 
stuff stock one 
'll sell , like standard dram 's , 80386 's , 68000 's , etc , etc. . 
i.e. cna ' think ` ' store . 
closest get pick copy byte magazine 
circuit cellar , popular electronics , like flip 
. 
distributors like wyle electronics , hamilton avnet , pioneer electronics , 
etc , etc , normally deal end-user like 
couple everything ... deal people buy 
hundred . 
distributor represent sell variety 
different manufacturer . 
mean ? 
suppose abc electronics sell intel 80386 's . 
pretty good 
bet sell amd 's 386 's , vice-versa . 
also obtain chip want manufacturer 
represent . 
know ? 
might lucky able buy one . 
would suprise . 
also bear mind 1 2 
price charge much greater 
mail order outlet charge . 
advice ? 
gon na design anything , try stick 
off-the-shelf stuff . 
go get stick use 
many esoteric part sooner later . 
good luck , 
aaron
