would give baserunning little credit , maybe 45-5 , 
even 40-10 . 
give team roberto alomar team john 
identical batting stats would unreasonable , 
even let roberto steal single base , 'll score lot 
go often . 
offense , 
gordon .

mean comment time . 
way baserunning could important - , 
run create would nearly accurate . 
run create usually 90-95 % accurate team level , 
lot baserunning account 
remain percent .
