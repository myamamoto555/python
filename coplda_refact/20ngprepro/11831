give certain archival method certain key file 
use dictionary attack . 
use des library provide 
system use . 
keep anyone lucky key ?

previous employment nothing current address , 
fact fastest machine office ibm risc 
model 530 , 16 meg memory .

dunno . 
really think statement limitation place key 
interface padding , program bother 
clear archival front backend id 's .

: - 
yes bright programmer little idle machine time , 
crack today real world encryption . 
sure could 
select key , prepare datum decryption become

real world , sure 
agency would start attack message , point , 
good recognition algorithm , familiar .
