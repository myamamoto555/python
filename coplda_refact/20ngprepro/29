case slot 8 , would like 
: get scanner , card already max would ! 
: hope simple solution exist , e.g. adapter turn 
sure work , use one ` ' expander 
use low-profile case . 
allow 3-5 slot stagger either 
side card . 
install last slot , probably 
2 3 sideways slot . 
actually low 
profile case - standard motherboard , ` ' connector one slot , 
expansion card plug ` ' . 
guess could 
end slot 1 & 8 add even . 
` ' connector simply track slot - electronics 
. 
downside - case close , homebrew system , 
may problem . 
know performance , though . 
'll leave discussion
