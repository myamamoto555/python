one ever flog , beat , burn , feed lion , kill 
way belief resurrection - sorry disappoint . 
idea resurrection one find host different 
form religion antiquity . 
problem resurrection 
issue tiny fragment jewish population 
non issue everyone else . 
real problem 
christian pacifist preach one god . 

state operate system emperor - monotheism 
become capital offense . 
jews able get exemption , 
also evangelistic . 
christian far vocal , gentile , 
hence dangerous therefore target persecution . 
also since 
christian relatively powerless group , make good scapegoat 
see nero 's blame burning rome . 
let 's cloud 
issue resurrection .

believe resurrection .

cause trouble dependent belief resurrection jesus . 
course problem alternative 
great conspiracy . 
common theory among non-christian 
scholar seem resurrection subjective event -- 
effect , delusion .
