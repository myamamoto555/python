idea make circuit 
difficult program arbitrary value eeprom . 

secondary purpose , primary purpose standpoint 
practicality , distribute write avoid 
maximum number write fof eeprom use . 
microprocessor also ignore pulse come hall effect 
rate higher 110 mph make spoof reading 
bench pulse least somewhat undesirable . 

automobile expect ever exceed 110 mph 
operation . 
case , course , might 
1993 rx-7 ! 
ecm module car indeed store info condition 
car operate . 
since steer angle 
velocity datum , etc available would difficult 
collect sort interesting demographic information 
driver ' use car . 
aware manufacturer 
currently try enforce warranty restriction base reading 
use datum ecm . 
could potential invasion 
privacy manufacturer access datum 
drive style , could also provide valuable information 
actual field use condition help engineer appropriate car . 
personally would mind dealer collect driving 
demographic long anonymous fashion .
