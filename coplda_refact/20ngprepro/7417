think all-star team able beat 
may appropriate comparison . 
1929-31 yankees 2nd , 3rd 2nd 
18 , 16 game first . 
1933 , '34 also finish second though 
7 , 7 3 game . 
even great team lose - play season . 
hand ... still pick braves go way 
john rickert 

prediction ' 93 : marlin : 70 win , rockies : 50 win 
... rockies fan claim offense adequate .
