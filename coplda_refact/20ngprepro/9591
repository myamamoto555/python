reply person attempt justify fatwa 
rushdie grounds work intentionally 
insulting . 
think take single sentence fairly long 
post , say 
`` know , 
seem imply ... '' 
best quite disingenuous , perhaps even 
dishonest . 
anyone care dig back read full 
post , see nothing kind . 
trust deny islamic teaching `` something 
'' fatwa rushdie ?
