unfortunately able find completely precise 
statement need . 
usual , current edition 
catholic encyclopedia frustratingly vague . 
know 
priest view witness , thus sense would 
require . 
however part purpose formal marriage avoid 
ambiguity take commitment . 

community provide support marriage , case problem 
involve help make sure people carry much 
commitment possible . 
thus marriage must public 
commitment . 
presence priest require regular 
marriage . 
clear exactly boundary 
exceptional case `` valid irregular '' . 
ne 1907 say 
marriage involve catholic valid without priest accord 
oxford dictionary church , imply new 
canon law retain , would rather see recent 
authoritative source . 
note catholic priest require 
catholics , catholic church recognize marriage 
baptize non-catholics valid without priest .
