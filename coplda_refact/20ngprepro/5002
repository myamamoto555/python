different class people yes , consider law 
enhance penalty follow conviction base upon 
convict 's attitude towards class membership victim fit 
category , category class mind 
standard civil rights discussion -- class base upon race , gender , 
ethnicity , religion , sexual orientation , etc. . 
ask 
class base upon one 's _ profession _ rather one 's personal 
characteristic catch guard , think question 
scratch . 
finally decide law recognize 
class would formally officially declare 
people worth , would anathema 
underlying american concept equal treatment law . 
last year , federal crime bill consideration would 
expand federal death penalty additional 
crime , include murder various federal officer hitherto 
protect `` aura deterrence , '' critic point 
absurdity law make death penalty available

emotionally compelling argument , even proponent 
viewpoint appear tacitly assume state judge 
life valuable basis 
`` contribution society . ''

accordingly , believe law give 
class people special protection via mechanism 
supply stronger statutory deterrence crime member 
class , even police officer , federal officer high-ranking 
member executive branch federal government .
