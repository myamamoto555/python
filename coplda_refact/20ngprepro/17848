untrustworthy , silly stat , today 's rule , 
baseball . 
understanding qualify save pitcher 
pitch three inning potential tie run must least 
appear on-deck circle . 
also , lead pitcher enter 
three run . 
believe official scorer must assert authority 
determine . 
instance , pitcher come 
ninth lead , blow lead , fall behind , team come back 
next half inning earn win . 
pitcher earn win , 
way . 
guy could pitch five strong inning middle relief see 
teammate rally tie score . 
assume come start fourth 
leave eighth . 
teammate hold opposition scoreless 
ninth score run bottom ninth win . 

third pitcher earn win middle reliever get `` stat '' 
satisfaction .
