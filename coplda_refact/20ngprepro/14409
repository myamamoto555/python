know first thing yeast infection scientist . 
scientist would take statement -- `` convincing empirical evidence 
support existence systemic yeast syndrome '' -- tell 
anything except absence datum question . 
point 
catch-22 `` crazy '' theory true , probably could 
find direct evidence -- could observe 
beastie present method even . 
nore 
fellow oklahoma sorry , forget name also suggest one set 
anecdotal evidence favor base personal experience -- 
namely , people certain condition give anti-fungal , 
many appear get better . 
, evidence hypothesis -- example , 
controlled double-blind study show anti-fungal 
better sugar water -- let 's hear . 
, 
anecdotal uncontrolled evidence one side , abject 
disbelief . 
case , please , point yell 
back forth longer since neither side 
convincing evidence either positive negative . 
understand abject disbelief base existence 
people may get famous make money apply diagnosis everything 
sight , make wild claim evidence , always refuse 
controlled study . 
absolutely bearing apparently 
sincere experience people net observe anti-fungal work 
people certain specific case . 
also 
quack sell oral superoxide dismutase , spite fact 
completely break gut , change genuine 
scientific knowledge role superoxide dismutase fight 
oxidative damage . 
thing . 
cause candida quack , 
establish evidence candida hypothesis . 

reason besides quack , anecdotal , think could 
true , consider , net people 
talk . 
, point argue . 
anecdotal 
evidence , convincing evidence , also 
candida quack , hope everyone agree . 
thus , 
appear main question whether proponent 
marshall enough anecdotal evidence convincing document enough 
manner make good case carry good controlled double-blind 
study antifungal else , forget convincing anybody else carry 
test , carry ! 
-- also , whether 
adequately define patient population symptom study 
carry provide fair test hypothesis .
