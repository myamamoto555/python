paul , quite frankly 'll believe really go work 
typical trash one need process see put couple 
ton one end get relatively clean material end , 
plus able run residual power . 
sound almost like 
perpetual motion , ?

well , pardon try continue discussion rather 
tug forelock dismay consider actually try 
recover energy process least try 
go ` right ' way energy curve . 
, put 
sackcloth ash ? 
` pretend ' anything ; please 
surprise , though . 
> , nothing like perpetual motion . 
note say perpetual motion , even 
sound like perpetual motion ; phrase `` sound almost like 
perpetual motion '' , , least , consider somewhat different 
one elect criticize . 
perhaps 
beg pardon precise use language ?

believe process come even close approach 
technological economic feasibility give mixed nature 
trash run oppose cost 
separate thing first different ` run ' 
actinide see dump ton one end pull 
relatively clean material . 
cost , 
technological risk , etc. , take account still class 
one idea throw waste sun . 
sure , possible 
physics well understand , really reasonable 
approach ? 
still wonder sort ` burn ' rate could get 
something like , oppose kind energy would 
really recover oppose would cost build power 
without energy recovery . 
talk ounce , pound , 
ton gram , kilogram , metric ton , si fan 
material talk day , week , month , year day , 
week , month year , si fan -- hmmm , still use 
time scale , see ?
