certainly multi-user . 
see march beta 
yet come stuff exploit multi-user 
feature . 
remember somebody m state allow 
two user share one gui . 
interpretation one user 
per console networking rpc base stuff want . 
believe ftp nt system come third 
party . 
somebody already beta version unsecure 
net . 
reason one write posix base shell like 
csh unix remote login . 
general like nt check . 
slow compare 
.1 like real os . 
beta version , although 
slow , bott much faster sun workstation . 
windows subsystem 
also start lot faster x window . 
believe bill gates 
right state nt everybody . 
play 
around convince . 
use 
`` business computer '' ibm established vendor , 
would consider move nt platform would provide much 
cheaper solution run sql server etc. . 
provide 
robustness application require . 
hand like dos game , less forget 
nt . 
always boot dos general defeat 
purpose use nt . 
nt 's feature visible 
networked environment environment reboot 
machine . 
personal use , would rather wait win32 
base windows release whatever name jump nt bandwagon . 
expect application keep use win32 
become widely available .
