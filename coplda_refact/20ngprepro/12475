keyword : z-buffer , roundoff , line , area 
lines : 84 
ask help sticky problem involve unreasonably low 
apparent precision , encounter 2 different 
pex implementation . 
find discussion problem 
resource lay hand e.g. faq , gaskins 's 
_ _ , vendor ' documentation . 
post article , virtually 
article test program demonstrate problem 
. 
problem hard describe without picture , 
hence article longish . 
run 5 . 
x program 
interested , encourage build run test program 
see effect play approach 
deal . 
depend utility code 
gaskins book ; instruction fetch via anonymous ftp give . 
problem solve eliminate minimize `` stitch '' 
artifact result use 
coplanar fill area . 
interpolate z value along line 
differ slightly , due roundoff error , interpolate z value 
across area , even endpoint line coincident 
vertex area . 
, tossup whether 
z-buffer allow line pixel area pixel display . 
visually , result tend effect even though 
line suppose solid . 
use apus , approach solution use two slightly 
different pex view mapping transform , two view table entry , one 
area one line . 
pex structure immediate - 
mode output must organize one view table index always 
effect area , always effect line . 

result slight shift npc z coordinate line , 
attempt bias tossup situation favor line . 
shift effect move front back clipping plane use 
view table entry line hair `` backwards '' i.e. 
smaller vrc z coordinate , compare position view 
table entry use area . 
mean point transform 
npc , z value slightly bigger come line 
come area , thus accomplish desire bias . 
would expect z roundoff error cause problem amount 
unit , entire dynamic range z-buffer , 
typically 0 i.e. 16 24 bit z-buffer . 
therefore , seem tiny fraction range z vrc 
front back clip plane ought suffice reliably fix 
stitching . 
fact , experience show shift much 0.003 
0.006 range . 
empirically , worst npc z 
component slope surface high , i.e. appear 
less edge-on viewer . 
8 9 bit 
z-buffer dependable meaning ! 
amount great one 
problem replace another : sometimes `` show '' 
area suppose lie behind . 
observe problem hewlett-packard digital 
workstation pex server , approximately degree . 
test 
program demonstrate problem mit 5 . 
x implementation ; 
version know compile run hp-ux system pex 
5.1 . 
open question : 
1 happen ? 
-- configure pex view table wrongly ? 
-- systematic difference z interpolation line 
oppose area e.g. pixel center versus corner 
could correct ? 
-- pex implementor wantonly discard z precision 
? 
-- something else ? 
2 ? 
-- fix use view table allow better precision 
? 
-- another approach take remove stitching 
artifact ? 
-- luck ? 
help would immensely appreciate !
