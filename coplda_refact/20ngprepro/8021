say consume . 
aspartame methyl ester dipeptide , product 
hydrolysis go methanol , oxidize 
formaldehyde . 
amount methanol form ingestion 
food completely metabolic noise , 
since form equally minute amount methanol 
component food time . 
study involve administration 
high dose additive , blood methanol level undetectable . 
methanol poison quantity see human poisoning , 
say . 
consequence oxidation formaldehyde 
formic acid , two quite reactive compound high enough level 
damage tissue like retina kidney , high dose 
body 's detoxification system overwhelm . 
interestingly , one 
treatment early methanol poisoning get person drunk 
ethyl alcohol -- vodka equivalent . 
ethanol 
metabolize preferentially methanol enzyme liver . 
methanol stay methanol metabolize formaldehyde , 
actually relatively non-toxic .
