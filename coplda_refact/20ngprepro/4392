owen one error far , believe . 
seriously 
harm field . 
owen cleanly play ball reach . 
fine 
field percentage , like always . 
problem 
reach anything hit straight ! 
would quite obvious problem play next 
kelly gruber robin ventura . 
third baseman yankees 
wade boggs move across diamond last year ! 
see one game , abbott 's first start , three 
ball hit left side would stop quality 
defensive player . 
instead charge hit abbott . 
cheers ,
