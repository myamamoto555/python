# `` motivate '' `` allow ? '' 
christian bible say one may kill 
certain circumstance . 
fact , instruct one kill 
circumstance . 
would say majority people moral system instruct 
kill certain circumstance . 
get distinction 
motivate allow , agree flavor theism ` allow ' 
, indictment theism . 
rather 
depend ` certain circumstance ' . 
talk 
christianity , islam , least claim understand . 
people go general statement theism fall 
apart . 
one could believe god instruct one utterly 
harmless .

religion supply , easy ? 
necessarily . 
`` love thy neighbor '' supply - 
demolish . 
definition religion broader 
definition theism , explain .

# 
protestant extremist kill four catholic 
? 
religiously motivate ? 
opinion . 
obscure 
point theology , yes . 
since protestant 
elect extremist , broad 
say `` religion '' . 
say cause far 
complex - take away religious element , would still 
powerful motive revenge misguided patriotism . 

know , catholics protestants worldwide say ` stop 
kill ' , one might listen , especially claim 
read mind . 
# 
# 
# | > also , murder ensue fatwa mr. rushdie , inquisition , 
# | > many religous war . 
# 
's special exception ? 

- bag ad-hoc excuse consider murder 
religiously motivate ? 
general principle behind 
? 
general principle fairly clear , least 
religion primary motivator enabler , whatever . 

nearly obvious go one look ni , apart 
violence course .

northern irish protestants say

# | > #

mr o'dwyer assure

terrible thing lose 
# | > mind . 
maybe word `` country '' kick . 
# | > certainly believe unionists god - think 
# | > wish maintain position privilege . 
# 
still listen say , still tell 
version think . 
read mind , . 
speculate motive often enough , take 
statement belief face value - therefore claim 
read mind credibility , sorry . 
also note 
fail answer question . 
look much like 
axe grind - especially indeed ignore 
protestants say - killing '' . 
people 
refer properly describe unionist , protestants . 
# 
position privilege , religion - 
? 
base politics , bigotry , heartless extremism . 
none 
thing synonymous religion , though certainly 
overlap .
