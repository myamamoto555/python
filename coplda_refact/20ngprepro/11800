main effect spherical aberration problem 
primary mirror drive computer engineer develop image 
processing software much faster . 
use _ _ deconvolution 
software image fix hubble , ready 
incredible result ! 
every reason believe result 
_ exceed _ original spec fair margin . 
adaptive optics combination hardware software . 
work 
realtime , fact , case hubble . 
might 
interested know technology make amateur market , 
form adaptive optics system . 
start page 52 
april , 1993 sky & telescope three page review new product . 
list $ 1,290 . 
article state : `` adaptive optics system 
come handy case three-year-old could carry 
around . '' 
even though device really good brightest 
object , `` could cope image movement 0.8 millimeter 
telescope 's focal plane . '' 
imagine well infant 
technology year , especially dedicated system 
hundred thousand dollar , many invest 
development .
