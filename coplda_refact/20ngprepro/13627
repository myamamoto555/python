oh , bad . 
every time try change oil , forget 
shut engine first . 
hot oil come scald , blind 
, engine start overheat , scream agony 
try crawl car , grab red hot exhaust 
pipe get third degree burn hand . 
scream intensify 
finally emerge car , struggle foot front 
car , whereupon radiator hose rupture spray super 
heated coolant . 
engine seize , cylinder head 
explode , pierce flesh fragment red hot iron . 
happen every time . 
start think pay mechanic 
$ 25 instead pay hospital $ 250,000 dealer $ 25,000 new 
car . 
get costly change oil every 3000 mile .
