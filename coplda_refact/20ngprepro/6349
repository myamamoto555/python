problem . 
look motif + + , wwl , interviews , gina + + , 
variation . 
also cursory examination 
rogue wave 's + + . 
like + + 's abstraction best 
toolkit mention , result code look little like motif , 
little confidence software catch otherwise result 
significant longevity code . 
gina + + allow write code 
look great deal like motif also make interesting use inheritance , 
result code almost , certainly 
significantly less verbose equivalent c code . 
interview look 
promising , find free version motif support , 
confident widely interviews motif support adopt , 
specific motif support available time . 

library produce code less , make 
sufficient use feature c + + simplify code task . 
point , inclination write motif manipulation routine 
c , invoke routine c + + code use simple abstraction suit 
specific task . 
later , osf credible body 
come c + + interface motif , change . 

goo write c + + choice interface leave code 
leave tie abstraction consistent industry 
direction . 
better take standard inferior solution 
go superior approach leave 
useless code useless skill year . 
+ + 
library would consider right , environment , would end spending 
nearly $ 5000 use , justify likely cause 
short-term productivity decrease learn new abstraction , 
unlikely sufficiently long-lived solution reap benefit 
high end j curve .
