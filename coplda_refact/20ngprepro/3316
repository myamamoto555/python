chip include follow component : 
skipjack encryption algorithm 
f , 80-bit family key common chip 
n , 30-bit serial number 
u , 80-bit secret key unlock message encrypt chip 
hmmm . 
thirty bit serial number . 
, tell , unit key u 
derive deterministically serial number . 
mean 
one billion possible unit key . 
generate unit key serial number n , 30-bit value n 
first pad fix block produce 64-bit block n1 . 
s1 s2 use key n1 , produce 
64-bit block r1 : 
r1 e d e n1 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 . 
similarly , n pad two block produce n2 
n3 , two additional 64-bit block r2 r3 compute : 
r2 e d e n2 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 
r3 e d e n3 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 . 
r1 , r2 , r3 together , give 192 bit . 

first 80 bit assign u1 second 80 bit u2 . 

rest discard . 
unit key u xor u1 u2 . 
u1 u2 
key part separately escrow two escrow 
agency . 
hmmm . 
must assume generate unit key u serial 
number n rather generate randomly select u1 u2 
intentional way assure `` fail safe '' government -- 
u determine give s1 , s2 n. s1 s2 
change constitute effective `` master key '' along f , 
theft possession various authority 
completely obviate security system . 
however , 
interestingly , know , fact s1 s2 fix 
matter u 2 ^ 30 . 
pick u1 
u2 random ? 
interesting restriction key space 
provide additional back door ? 
find disturbing best security dependant 
approximately 30 byte worth information could write 
back napkin . 
even s1 s2 change periodically , rationale behind 
restriction size seem strange one 
assume goal security -- make perfect sense 
goal illusion security . 
s1 s2 change , even remain secret wonder 
somehow give enough unit number 
pair . 
assure happen -- one 
understand skipjack work outside government official , 
soon , foreign intelligence service gain information via 
espionage . 
presumably eventually information well 
-- reverse engineering get advanced every year -- 
time know may late . 
sequence value u1 , u2 , u generate , 
write onto three separate floppy disk . 
first disk contain 
file serial number contain corresponding key part 
u1 . 
second disk similar contain u2 value . 
third 
disk contain unit key u. agent 1 take first disk agent 
2 take second disk . 
third disk use program chip . 
chip program , information discard 
vault agent leave . 
laptop may destroy additional 
assurance information leave behind . 
none make feel least bit secure . 
silly notion 
`` destroy laptop '' appear yet another bizarre distraction . 
know read datum dram turn 
moment . 
hand , know 
need generate unit key s1 s2 
first place weaken system . 
know 
agent question would resist million cash piece 
information -- probably worth hundred million , make 
bribe arbitrarily hard resist . 
tell truth , 
`` vault '' rather joe random room 
laptop computer seem like melodrama design make 
high-school dropout peoria impressed -- little 
rest . 
protocol may change slightly four people 
room instead two . 
first two would provide seed s1 s2 , 
second two escrow agent would take disk back 
escrow agency . 
would provide ? 
let say escrow agency aclu 
nra agent personally take back disk always 
honest . 
care ? 
nsa must laugh loud , 
algorithm regenerate u give n likely need 
steal key effectively already .
