player . 
believe 
season 's end chris sabo 's batting average clutch situation 
significantly lower batting average 
situation . 
prove happen , guess ` ll 
wait see .

whether know reason correlation , 
deny existent , make argument 
think likely continue exist 
see reason exist . 
> run prove nothing . 
give reason expect clutch ba 
> correlate one year next ? 
see detailed study 
someone post recently negative clutch would correlate . 
argument along line star player split 
always see adverse condition late inning close game 
i.e. opposing manager always bring ah pitcher 
face , manager pull ph
