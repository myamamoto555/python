let 's get back basics . 
canon latin mean rule . 

say rule open rule make break . 
issue also measurement rule . 
thus word 
speak need compare 
add canon . 
new revelation necessary ? 
topical , current , personal revelation 
would say necessary . 
new revelation people time 
necessary scripture . 
also seem confuse canon scripture . 
scripture may speak 
open - ie god speak today . 
would speak 
close sense canon unchangeable . 
though concept 
canon later historically .

agree problem confusion . 
prophecy mean encourage , 
exhort correct overlap scripture . 
prophecy 
mean bring ` word ' form `` man live 
husband '' knowledge . 
yet exact word scripture . 
would expect difference motive mean delivery . 
reading scripture powerful force .
