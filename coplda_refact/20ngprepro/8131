part start earlier example illinois , usa require 
anyone x automobile transfer year x 10 , think 
become licensed used car dealer . 
addition , anyone 
used car dealer 's license least 10 car time , 
time . 
let continue example try answer steve 's question . 
steve , let 's say talent inclination fix resell 
car . 
either get good enough spare time bump 
limit , would like full-time 
stupid , arbitrary law prevent start small pull 
. 
protect hungry neighborhood competitor willing 
take low profit work extra hard fulfill need , ` re 
protect want life . 
see libertarianism offering : 
money truly ; belong . 
use buy car . 
use buy car , truly car ; belong . 

use money fix car . 
since car , sell 
car . 
life truly ; belong . 
matter someone 
think `` wrong '' buy sell 10 car within 12 month 
rather , say , 9 car . 
may , life 
money , life money . 
money truly mine ; belong . 
use buy car . 
perhaps car . 
perhaps 10th car , one someone , somewhere 
sell , presumably , buy . 
someone could go government insist government make 
stop . 
government would powerless stop 
like property , fraud agression . 
would powerless stop associate . 
seem utopian dream , basic human decency 
common sense . 
real grass-roots example freedom liberty . 
yes , people act master , approve 
reject basic transaction , strike 
wonderful way improve human condition . 
thanks awfully ,
