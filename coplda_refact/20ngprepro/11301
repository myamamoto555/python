call `` trinity catholic church 's definition 
'' precisely result first christian get 
together try find acceptable answer 
question `` christian ? '' 
. 
see 
object : someone say historian belief 
would agree , call bigot ? 
really ought say mean `` belief jesus 
christ '' . 
wording sufficient describe 
christian . 
muslims believe jesus christ although 
believe prophet incarnate son god . 

follower eastern religion might quite happy say 
jesus incarnation god - along large number 
historical mythical figure . 
perhaps ought rephrase question say 
precisely traditional definition 
christian , hand universal church , 
object regard unnecessary christian .
