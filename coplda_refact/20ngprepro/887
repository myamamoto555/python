like expand show automation bit - namely add capability 
use cue tape bring . 
current automation 
console date early 60 's provide function . 
already combo roller read , 
dimmer system raise control 
circuit 120 vac momentarily close , least 0.5 second . 
try wiring dimmer control 12v relay , activate 
cue tape complete circuit . 
low tech simple , one 
problem : order get second pulse , need 
sh load film . 
35mm run 90 foot per minute , 
get second pulse , need least 9 inch solid 
! 
ideally , would like use single accomplish function . 
single strip perpendicular length film 
would give pulse approximately second . 
need circuit detect short cue activate relay 
around second . 
ability adjust long relay 
activate would nice . 
figure would require rc circuit 
sort . 
sure already solution figure 
head . 
suggestion schematic would appreciate ! 
thanks ,
