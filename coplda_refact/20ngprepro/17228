far know , way get around bio password except 
short power supply cmo memory , thereby erase . 

remove password , also destroy previous bio 
setting , 'll go set . 
386 , 
jumper motherboard provide purpose 
short battery . 
short jumper briefly , interrupt 
power cmos long enough erase . 
would imagine 
something like board . 
future , would suggest set password , leave 
`` setup '' . 
way , no-one else go reset set '' 
always '' unless know password use . 

get bunch new 386 's , reason .
