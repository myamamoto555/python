note : try figure stuff month ago , 
various people net , could wrong . 
datum ever read bar , course , 
eventually get turn 44.1 khz , 16 bit , two channel datum . 
take two discrete datum point , interpolate n-1 point 
n time . 
ask , people say 
interpolation simply linear interpolation , significantly 
complicate . 
anyway , , purpose oversampling move `` effective '' 
sampling rate n time 44.1 khz , order use higher frequency 
filter . 
quality filter , higher oversampling 
let build cheaper filter , whereas price filter , higher 
oversampling let build better filter . 
, assume quality 
component cd player remain , 
allow manufacturer produce _ slightly _ better sound due 
filter .
