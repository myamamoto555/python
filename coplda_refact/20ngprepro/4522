since doctor private `` system '' insurance 
plan , litigation would involve insurance fund . 
lawyer 
work contingency , sue malpractice 
would better sure win cover fee ... likewise , 
doctor subject suit , time sweat . 
since provincial wing cma one go bat 
fee schedule hike present , doctor 
cackle realize cma would grow strength 
rather diminish , especially unopposed unlike socialize 
medicine approach like britain 's national health service .

company provide extra insurance subsidiary 
american company , parent provide full insurance

regardless , firm north easily turn cable tv 
see well american firm involve 
basic coverage . 
private firm make much money 
get rid basic coverage . 
run around pat - 
self back cooperation provide extra 
people `` deserve '' . 
private insurance realize much money would make without 
risk involve basic insurance e.g. , neurosurgery versus deluxe 
amenity e.g. , call granada tv replace rental set 
fritz someone 's private hospital room , start pat 
back social responsibility .
