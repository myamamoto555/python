wonder `` vandalize '' proper word use situation . 

dictionary define `` vandalism '' `` willful malicious 
public private property , especially anything beautiful . '' 

would agree sky beautiful , public private property . 
personally prefer natural sky , far city light san aircraft . 
however , also something say able look 
sky see satellite . 
many people get real kick , especially 
see one .
