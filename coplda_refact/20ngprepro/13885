sorry , still buy . 
certainly right runner 
merely run baseline : must interfere 
play . 
argument constitute interference . 
certainly infer quote 
must hit ball guilty interference : post 
definition interference . 
imo call one `` approved ruling '' go small print 
rulebook . 
something like : 
approve ruling : 
judgement umpire runner , run left 
allow path , cause fielder make bad throw , block 
vision fielder receive throw , otherwise impede 
defensive team 's make play , shall 
guilty interference . 

approve ruling : 
runner judge guilty interference unless make 
contact fielder hit throw ball . 
-- 
absence approve ruling claim poor 
rule trivia question -- since authoritatively answer .
