say `` hopefully effect policy x y '' much different 
say `` hopefully effect policy x y. '' 
make statement . 
former describe outcome policy x , 
perhaps policy x worthy consideration - latter statement 
something base policy decision !

certainly accidental death cause serious thing - 
anti-gun group insist accidental death 
firearm serious problem , even use 
death justification gun control , group . 

sorry jump conclusion reason mention 
accidental death due firearm something warrant concern , 
light statement staunch supporter gun 
control measure , think conclusion reasonable one . 
fact remain tragic though individual accidental gun death may 
, serious problem statistically speak . 
please explain think `` symbolic offering '' good .

sorry clear . 
think waffle view 
buyback program talk symbolic offering hopefully 
prevent accident shooting . 
disagree 
count ; understand buying gun people 
intend misuse obviously want use gun 
commit crime go turn could construe 
positive way police respond `` interpersonal violence . '' 
suggest go back look wherever see `` statistics '' - 
suspect 'll find look carefully 135,000 number 
student estimate carry weapon necessarily gun 
school least past year , number student 
carry gun school daily . 

> well joe , suggest talk center prevent handgun violence 
, people publish figure say many child commit 
suicide handgun alone year fbi say commit suicide 
method per year ? 
think believe ? 
people call 
everyone age 24 `` child '' scream `` carnage 
nation 's child '' cause handgun ? 
> centers disease control . 
ah , yes , agency consider accidental shooting child 
statistical problem state objective healthy people 
2000 document `` enact law 50 state require manufacturer 
handgun make handgun difficult fire , minimize 
likelihood accidental intentional child ? '' 

agency fund `` study '' dc pronounce dc gun ban 
save x life yes , actually give number basis 
look number shooting rather rate shooting ? 
fault population dc drop `` post law '' 
period ...
