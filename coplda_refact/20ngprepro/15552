often time recently list last day ` ve 
hear passage revelation : 
'' ... whoever add sacred word book ... whoever remove 
word book ... '' 
use arguement book . 
feel ridiculous two reason : 
1 . 
add later catholic church ; 
always part consider inspired scripture . 
deal previous posting ... reason 
repeat info . 
2 . 
likely st. john whomever write 
book revelation consider scripture 
thing hold hand ! 
one take translation `` book '' rev 18:22 somewhere 
around mean `` scripture '' , likely 
hold something violation command . 
impossible exactly date scripture , even n.t. one 
like date letter , guess . 
really wish 
bible right get fact straight , believe 
several n.t. letter , chief among 2 peter , 
likely date composition early second century a.d. 
revelation almost certainly write durin reign 
sp ? 
, a.d. . 
thus could argue 
sin accept 2 peter scripture , since `` add '' 
book composition revelation , tell add 
nothing . 
want get exact date , get copy new american 
bible . 
'll try follow tomorrow remember .
