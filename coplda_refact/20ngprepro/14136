tricky situation ; previous owner inform 
dealer odometer change , previous owner commit 
fraud , may liable . 
dealer may also liable ; 
previous owner notify dealer , previous owner 
dash replace dealer , previous owner dash change 
legally , record search car turn fact 
odometer alter . 
dealer change speedometer , 
report go car 's service record manufacturer , 
title , remember correctly ; dealer tell 
old mileage , etc. send ford t-bird 's speedo 
replace . 
odometer set old mileage , must 
; eg , odometer mileage 
old odometer must write permanent sticker 
affix door frame vehicle . 
either way , change legally , record search 
dealer almost certainly turn . 
call state 's department 
vehicles -- tag agent -- find certain 
rights . 
state 's attorney general know certain ; -
