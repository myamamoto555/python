think joe say thing . 
however , question 
`` ask jesus come heart '' seem imply infant 
allow christ . 
must baptism always 
view people sort `` prodigal son '' type thing ; i.e. 
sudden change heart , go accept christ suddenly 
accept christ ? 
people start christ shortly 
birth , build relationship ? 
, 
man suddenly meet woman , marry day ? 

experience , learn relationship must build , 
include one 's relationship god . 
also joe speak standpoint baptism 
ritual , god bestow sacramental grace upon 
recipient . 
certainly mental faculty know christ 
necessary believe . 
however , sacrament 
bestow grace recipient , make permanent mark adoption 
god 's family soul .
