dealer make money three way , let : 
1 new car markup cost remember , 
2 arrange financing dealership , 
3 screw trade . 
keep deal dealer simple eliminate 2 & 3 . 
buy car 
`` dealer 's cost '' meaningless make $ 1000 trade get 
kickback bank . 
blue book need know talk average wholesale average 
retail good guide value car .

try get average retail , chance 'll ok . 
careful selling acquaintance ever want become friend .
