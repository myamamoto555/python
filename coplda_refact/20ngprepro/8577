perhaps one way get away cripple chip u.s. 
government seem push would come good alternative . 
example , scheme use rsa , hybrid 
another strong stream cipher maybe ? 
could substantially 
cripple chip , except instead , 
police could demand give secret key court - 
issue warrant . 
, could read last month wiretapped 
message send , assume commit crime , could 
generate new key pair go business . 
find would 
willing pay rsa right use system , especially give 
alternative . 
unwilling give secret key , would 
probably stay jail anyone get real legal precedent ? 
. 
would allow warrant use gather information 
suspect criminal , could secrecy , 
would enormously less likelihood corruption theft escrowed key . 
maybe someone law-enforcement intelligent community correct 
, seem like big loss term law-enforcement 
capability . 
comment ?
