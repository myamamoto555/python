hope gordon bank mean imply notion 
candida infection cause various problem 
investigate . 
many researcher make breakthrough 
figure investigate thing previously think 
`` virtually impossible test . '' 
indeed , would surprise `` candida '' 
phenomenon . 
would think candida would produce signature 
byproduct whose measure would set lower bind 
extent recent infection . 
realize might get quite 
tricky difficult , probably expensive , likely inconvenient 
uncomfortable subject , 
`` virtually impossible . ''
