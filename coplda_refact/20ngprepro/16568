moderator general assembly , rev. john fife , visit 
church week ago 4 day rev. spahr -- busy 
week small church !! 
. 
ask specifically issue 
homosexuality think happen ga meeting next 
month . 
evidently , 15-20 known resolution pend range 
gamut `` outlaw '' homosexuality altogether `` legalize '' 
completely . 
readily admit difficult 
issue church deal since presbyterian church 
split two issue slavery 100 year ago . 
without 
question , issue may split church reunite 
dozen year . 
hopeful 
push attitude help church deal abortion 
issue last year solution . 
hope pass resolution less state , 
member church `` agree disagree '' issue , admit 
side honestly study scriptures spirit lead 
different conclusion . 
work last year abortion 
issue threaten less thing , hopeful 
ga foster loving caring attitude people disagree 
view .

go hard agree disagree . 
allow 
disagreement , presbytery church go ordain 
people recognize . 
difficult situation 
church . 
could live , think lot 
people would willing . 
note church willing 
live kind compromise ordination woman . 

one thing definitely prevent person become 
presbyterian minister indicate accept 
ordination woman . 
argument half 
church accept leader half . 
maybe people 
decide live case , 
wonder . 
admit presbytery submit overture 
ga would exactly effect , consider 
ambiguity better current situation .
