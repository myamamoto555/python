let begin say think world 's first religion use 
net major recruitment medium . 
therefore , even 
religion take , founding member important 
historically method solicit membership eventually become 
common . 
basis religion apply various aspect current conventional 
morality character genesis exodus assume bible 's 
account fact historical event correct . 
example , 
story adam eve : 
adam eve garden eden naked ignorant . 
unlimited 
supply food provide , clothing , job , knowledge . 
god say 
eat fruit tree knowledge . 
anyway , try hide 
bush . 
god find force garden . 
several different story naked 
bush might anger god . 
traditional philosophy : 
1 . 
reason need knowledge job eat . 
someone else 
provide food , stupid unemployed ok . 

married woman usually work recent decade . 
2 . 
authority figure , god , whoever behind vietnam war , hitler 
slaveowner , always right blindly follow without 
question ordinary people , make decision . 
interpretation event base traditional philosophy : 
suppose eat fruit . 
whatever god 
tell . 
like small child , need provide 
obligate whatever `` father '' say . 
force leave 
garden work order obtain food punishment . 
lesson traditional interpretation : 
1 . 
ignorance good . 
knowledge bad , tempting . 
2 . 
food provide nothing read `` welfare '' ideal . 
get - 
ting job feed earn punishment . 
3 . 
public nudity good . 
covering bad . 
4 . 
authority figure intrinsically right . 
normal people dumb 
whatever tell without question . 
think 
. 
5 . 
people subordinate position especially obligate refrain 
learn . 
example , illegal slave learn read . 
1990 's philosophy : 
1 . 
people seek education employment outside home , unless 
name `` hillary clinton '' `` murphy brown '' . 
2 . 
people use common sense . 
kill people 
binding issac , war , holocaust , etc. tell . 
interpretation event base current philosophy : 
suppose eat fruit . 
god give want seek knowledge 
rather hand silver platter . 
gain knowledge 
seek show ability make mature decision - 
self , longer need treat like little child 
reward allow `` real world . '' 
lesson new interpretation : 
1 . 
ignorance bad . 
knowledge good , must seek . 
2 . 
food provide nothing read `` welfare '' best 
temporary measure . 
get job feed earn 
ideal . 
3 . 
public nudity bad . 
covering good . 
4 . 
authority figure often wrong . 
normal people intelligent 
consider whether instruction really good idea `` alter 
abolish '' bad government . 
think . 
5 . 
people subordinate decision often discourage knowledge 
seek anyway , harder . 
example , poor child 
without good school work especially hard order make better 
life child . 
tentatively name new philosophy `` church '' 
eve 's decision eat apple man sic kind 's first good decision , instead 
first bad one , traditionally believe . 
therefore clearly 
protagonist . 
god first appear evil , tell people seek 
knowledge deeper analysis also protagonist . 
god reward 
decision defy , provide tree first place , intention 
desire clearly knowledge obtain , delay 
actively seek .
