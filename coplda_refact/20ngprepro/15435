exactly say ? 
sac > _ everyone _ include infant , unless scripture 
sac > contrary , i.e. exception . 
since exception list 
sac > bible , must assume safe side bible mean 
sac > say , _ everyone _ must baptize enter heaven . 
think see exception case cornelius 
household , mention act . 
course , baptise , 
`` god show accept give holy 
spirit '' . 
mean already acceptable god 
baptism , suddenly die would go heaven . 
case seem far-fetched - ancestor mine missionary 
work among hereros namibia . 
tribesman 
jealous christianity , poison first convert 
could baptise . 
surely still go heaven ? 
inclined 
agree comment record time : `` neglect 
baptism , contempt , condemn . ''
