evidence worthless . 
even doctor use drug 
treatment year , swear effective , often suprised 
result clinical trial . 
whether msg cause describable , 
reportable , documentable symptom pretty simple discover . 
quite leap logic observe one situation anecdotal 
evidence lead nowhere therefore conclude anecdotal evidence 
never lead anywhere . 
sure somebody provide example 
anecdotal evidence interpretation 
follow-on rigorous clinical trial .

good point . 
tendency newsgroup `` circle 
wagon '' viewpoint anecdotal medical evidence worthless 
maybe counter claim present anecdotal evidence 
support controversial subject , `` yeast hypothesis '' . 

evidence evidence - require `` jury '' process sort 
determine truth junk . 
medicine must continue strive better 
understand workings purpose alleviate 
illness - anecdotal evidence one piece puzzle ; 
worthless . 
rather , help focus limited resource right direction .
