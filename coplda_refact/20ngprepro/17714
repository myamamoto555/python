since post , assume aus angle . 
hacking 
aus student really suppose something else , e.g. 
thesis research & write , get supervisor ' pet program run properly , 
etc. . 
no-one get much glory hacking , no-one get money . 
producing good free software require enormous investment time & resource 
many people , want , afford - particularly recession . 
addition , last 10 year , think de-emphasis produce 
run program ai research , greater emphasis formal approach 
problem-solving . 
student prove theorem instead write program . 
conference year two ago , johann de suggest everyone 
` get back keyboard ' write program demonstrate idea - 
say inclined agree . 
claim , think invalidate remark . 
sure whole story .
