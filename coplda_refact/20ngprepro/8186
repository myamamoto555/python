well , use get mad , either try communicate anger jerk , 
, uhm , educate improve manners traffic . 
try get tail . 
heavy traffic slow bit , mostly buffer zone 
front balance minimal buffer behind , also often find 
jerk behind notice traffic move faster lane , switch 
one , pass - fine , keep 
better eye jerk behind , look ahead , rather 
front , splitting attention ahead mirror . 
traffic heavy way jerk pass , 
might pull , look street number name , 
still ignore jerk get jerk tail . 
sound , well , wimpy pessimistic , perhaps 
psych type passive-aggressive , consider prefer get 
adrenaline jolly ride , rather yell jerk . 
ride improve whole day , yell jerk likely 
ruin ride day anger . 
worst case , 
yell jerk could ruin life - since even tiny jerk 
cage behind better armed cage bike . 
hand , might try subtly arrange last 
vehicle legally cross one intersection , leave jerk 
wait cross traffic thus tail , cross 
illegally hopefully front wait police . 
like almost everything , choice mileage vary .
