main problem . 
scenario outline reasonably 
consistent , evidence familiar 
support , indicate something far different . 
earth , 
latest estimate , 4.6 billion year old , life 
3.5 billion year . 
human around 
200,000 year . 
, fossil evidence life 
change evolve , , fact , , long 
people . 
yes , fossil show sign disease ... 
mostly bone disorder , course , . 
heck , 
fossil evidence , able glean genetic study show 
disease around long , long time . 
human sin 
bring disease least , indirectly , though necessarily 
could exist human ?

uh ... know many evolutionary biologist , know 
biology claim , strongly disagree . 

evidence human genetic code ` start ' 
perfect condition . 
seem adapt , 
collective sense . 
really curious mean ` 
degeneration genetic code ' .

bad combination . 
umm . 
nah , seem pretty good job adapt virus 
bacterium , . 
small percentage 
harmful human ... small percentage seem 
constant size , rank keep change . 
example , bubonic 
plague use really nasty disease , sure 'll agree . 

still pop time time , even today ... 
much damage . 
part better sanitation , even 
people get disease , symptom tend less severe 
past . 
seem partly people susceptible 
die long ago , really nasty variant ` ' , 
forgive poor terminology , engineer , doctor !

, wait minute . 
question . 
human create perfect , right ? 
, admit inbuilt fight disease . 

seem unlikely satan , make disease , would also gift 
human means fight . 
simpler make disease less 
lethal , want survivor . 
far see , immune system , 
imperfect though may presently ? 
, must build 
god . 
want clear : say god plan 
ahead time satan would charge build immune 
system , time design , necessary ? 
, god make 
immune system ahead time , know adam eve would sin 
descendent would need fight disease ?

's another puzzle . 
, exactly , mean ` perfect ' 
phrase , ` create ... perfect without flaw ' ? 
mind , ` perfect ' 
system would incapable degrade time . 
` perfect ' system 
, without constant intervention , become imperfect 
perfect system . 
least , . 
god something like write masterpiece novel 
bunch gum wrapper hold together elmer 's glue ? 
, 
original genetic ` instruction ' perfect , ` write ' 
inferior material carefully tend would fall apart ? 
, could god use better material ? 
god incapable create system could maintain , 
choose ? 
deletion 
> summary , newborn innocent , god cause suffering . 
main point , say , really evidence 
explanation give . 
least , aware . 
, could 
help make nitpick .
