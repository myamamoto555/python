point mary 's take heaven end life 
earth : 
one piece evidence mary 's assumption heaven fact 
christian church ever claim sight 
bury . 
christian church claim locate final 
rest place peter , mark , saint , one ever 
claim possess body mary , greatest saint . 
? 
everyone know take heaven . 
although definitive scriptural proof assumption 
mary , passage seem suggestive , like passage revelation 
describe woman give birth son later crown 
heaven . 
course , woman passage 
interpretation ; also take symbol church . 
assumption mary make sense relationship 
christ . 
jesus , perfect god perfect man , fulfil 
requirement law perfectly . 
law god give , 
honor mother father , christ 's act take 
mother heaven part fulfillment law . 
also , 
take flesh , seem appropriate decide 
allow flesh rot grave . 
one last point : attempt explain catholic doctrine 
assumption assert connect belief mary 
die . 
correct summary catholics believe . 
dogma assumption carefully phrase avoid say 
whether mary die . 
fact , consensus among catholic 
theologian seem mary fact die . 
would make 
sense : christ die , mother , wait foot 
cross , would want share death .
