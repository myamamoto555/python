thanks . 
read mixed opinion . 
singed meat contain 
carcinogen , unless eat barbecue meat every meal , ` re 
probably much risk . 
think live life edge 
grill food . 
also read use petroleum base charcoal starter 
put unwanted toxin food , least unwanted odor . 
use egg carton cup dip paraffin fire starter , 
actually light faster easier lighter fluid . 
several 
people tell excellent result chimney , 
basically steel cylinder whole punch side . 

mean get one , one present 
shopping . 
make one coffee , buy 
coffee whole bean bag , big enough 
lay around .
