several type copy protection , point make sure 
user use legitimate copy . 
simplest virtually way 
program somehow fixate machine install 
sort checksum , serial number , whatever copy put different 
machine install original disk work . 
program definitely , restore machine depend 
programmer ... use disk drive characteristic ! 
user 
upgrade machine , reinstall program way . 
document look-up , disk ! 
say original would allow one install . 
user 's 
conscience . 
know , 'll get flame ... increase number `` casual '' 
user either unknowingly care software copyright 
truth . 
`` friend '' ask copy latest game 
time , refuse , go somebody else . 
, casual 
pirate become problem . 
sort copy protection 
discourage casual copying . 
see `` friend '' dig 
somewhere ... latest greatest game , crack , within day actual 
release ! 
know many byte need change x-wing disable 
quiz ? 
two ! 
yes , two ! 
ask one . 
determine 
pirate unstoppable , give enough time , result spread 
far , since pirate board well-known , easily track 
find authority . 
`` casual '' pirate copy protection 
determine discourage . 
believe company implement plus 
special patch user register loudly exclaim upon bootup 
`` register xxxxx -- address , city , state zip '' disable . 
two benefit : 1 encourage registration , 2 cut pirate 
make traceable , patch 's registration message 
encrypted , quite hard change , therefore provide 
stable trail allow copy hand , thus 
violate license agreement . 
way , legitimate user register experience minimal 
discomfort major upgrade computer frequently ? 

problem able restore another computer . 
register user would prove user therefore 
gain full rights , restore different machine . 
hand , 
software company record particular copy 
suppose . 
user 's copy find somewhere 
suppose , know break license agreement . 
course , 
hacker break eventually , point , ?
