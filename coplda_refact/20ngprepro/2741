know kratz understand safety suppose 
. 
also confuse `` thing see '' `` thing exist '' ; 
glock multiple safety even though one visible 
outside . 
>

kratz comment show otherwise .

bingo - question , glock 's qualify ? 
let 's see 
evidence kratz use . 
> christ , know since first crosman air gun . 

> know make assumption know know . 
first aside . 
air gun prove nothing . 
moreover , 
comment base kratz write . 
free argue 
babble text actually know something off-line . 
safety suppose keep gun go unless 
user want . 
glocks , one say `` want gun go 
'' pull trigger . 
safety make work , 
`` real '' safety , matter kratz think . 
> 
> thing glock always knock 
> trigger safety . 
supposedly harder learn use properly . 
harder ? 
note almost revolver work way , 
`` harder revolver '' . 
> every article read wrong damn thing . 
sure . 
moreover , know kratz ' sample 
unrepresentative . 
look reasoning . 
basically 
`` glock dangerous like & w third 
generation . '' 
part true , since people 
claim revolver , share relevant property , 
dangerous , see argument fail . 
> quote source keep ton gun magazine 
would care ? 
look bogus reasoning . 
> article lay around . 
boy , make simple statement 
> without someone get right ass . 
one make hundred simple statement without anyone 
`` get right ass '' . 
one merely make accurate simple 
statement . 
get `` attaboy `` mail publically . 
accuracy severe burden , manage .
