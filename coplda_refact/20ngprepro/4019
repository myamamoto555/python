soderstrom probably biggest surprise . 
re eric : true , fortunately get find would 
like without recchi 30 game . 
soderstrom : absolutely . 
4 shutout 39 game rookie without lot 
defense front . 
runnerup galley fedyk score 
ton career best . 
galley think paul coffey put score 
ahead defend fedyk tail big time . 
eklund : big question mark year come injury . 
42 
point 49 game bad , recently huge factor 
win get . 
eklund never point game season 
career , production typical . 
qualify 
disappointment ? 
anything surprise . 
choice would roussel go strictly expect player , 
never think take # 1 goalie . 
biggest 
disappointment bill dineen . 
think go perfect 
coach young team , instead make many bad move 
cost enough game keep playoff year . 

coach think put eric lindros point power play 
bright idea need go back coaching school .
