robert anderson write : 
: would like get opinion : exactly engage 
: couple become `` marry '' god 's eye ? 
say two 
: publically announce plan marry , make vow god , 
: unswervingly commit one another realize subjective 
: qualifier god 's sight . 
way read scripture , couple become marry physically 
marry , i.e. first sexual intercourse . 
e.g. end genesis 2 quote memory `` reason , man shall 
leave parent join wife , become one flesh '' 
jesus also quote scripture refer marriage . 
read genesis particular , often come across 
phraseology : `` man lay woman , become wife '' . 

imply become wife lay together , i.e. 
point intercourse . 
compare jewish tradition : joseph , hear mary 
pregnant , mind divorce quietly -- mary joseph 
, marry . 
i.e. , binding relationship 
require divorce get , marriage would occur mary 
joseph go bed together . 
compare christ church ephesians 5 , revelation 19 : church 
describe `` bride '' christ , marriage lamb take 
place jesus return . 
i.e. , binding 
jesus , still look forward time marriage 
take place . 
see spiritual equivalent sexual intercourse , 
represent intimate fellowship possible man god . 
summary , engagement honor binding relationship , 
marriage . 
civil ceremony marriage either . 
marriage occur 
point betrothed couple go bed together . 
mean demean 
civil church ceremony -- great ! 
mean pedantic . 
historically , think correct state civil ceremony i.e. 
marriage recognize state , around west since 
napoleon , introduce keep tab people although ready 
correct point ! 
view obviously raise question : 
sex one partner , without consider 
marriage . 
people also `` marry '' ? 
true marriage occur point intercourse , necessary 
marry eye state ? 
would say yes , honor 
law nation west . 
although illegal sleep 
together though unmarried western country , believe god - 
honor proclaim marriage state friend 
actually consummate marriage . 
salt light , 
also people perceive ; i.e. culturally insensitive 
declare marry without go civil ceremony .
