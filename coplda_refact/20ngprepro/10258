summary : another rewrite bible . 
keywords : scripture , implication , prophesy , ` woof ! ' 
organization : rowan college new jersey 
disclaimer : brandy hope doghouse rebuild . 
lines : 93 
lot discussion tyre . 
sum , ezekiel prophesy 
place would mash never rebuild ; lot 
people live , would appear ezekiel literally correct . 
bother , understand language ezekiel use 
differently so-called biblical literalist . 
example , sometimes 
happen someone say `` grandson cutest baby ! '' 
turn 
around see granddaughter say `` oh ! 
cutest thing !? '' 
person literally claim line baby 
world accord cuteness discover grandchild tie 
first . 
rather , try express emotion use word 
object-oriented . 
example one common many people , 
nobody misunderstand intent statement ; bible , however , 
often mercy people assume everything within must exactly 
literally true . 
people , existence tyre problem ; , 
. 
turn latest person try defend ezekiel , read 
john e king : 
> prophesy clearly imply people would still live 
> area . 
, imply nothing kind . 
nothing prophecy 
ezekiel , tell interpret literally , would never say 
`` oh , mean house business plant stuff 
like . '' 
would read `` make bare rock '' `` never 
rebuild '' , would conclude tyre would bare rock . 
way 
get ` fishing net ' ` house building medium-large 
population ' know latter stuff . 
word , answer mean ezekiel mislead everybody read 
prophecy time write . 
way , give literal 
reading , could read passage conclude `` medium-size city '' . 
seem feel `` never rebuild '' mean `` rebuild '' -- maybe , 
hardly ` clear implication ' . 
mr king also write : 
> far see state range 15,000 22,000 . 
> let 's assume latter one correct . 
modern standard 
> talk one-horse town . 
well , . 
bit less population annapolis , 
. 
know , naval , state capital , george washington 
resign commission statehouse ? 
annapolis may new york , 
least two-horse town . 
suppose 22,000 people `` small town '' -- still 22,000 people 
ezekiel predict . 
say nothing problem . 
chapter 26 , ezekiel 
predict nebuchadnezzar destroy tyre loot 
valuable . 
however , nebuchadnezzar destroy tyre , chapter 29 
ezekiel even quote god say `` army get reward 
campaign lead tyre . '' 
let 's ignore alexander moment , pay attention chapter 26 . 
ezekiel say n. would destroy tyre , n. destroy tyre . 
ezekiel say 
n. would plunder valuable , n. plunder valuable . 
regardless think tyre _ _ , fact n. die 
place destroy . 
ezekiel say n. go , n. . 

post , course , pointless . 
amazing ability 
rewrite bible need fit whatever want say . 
example , expect mr king respond comment ezekiel 26 
pull `` clear implication '' hat . 
ezekiel say n. would `` demolish tower '' , clearly imply 
wall would still stand people would know tower 
use . 
ezekiel say n. would `` demolish fine house 
throw stone , timber rubble sea '' , clearly imply 
n. would never set foot island . 
ezekiel write n. 
would `` build ramp wall '' , clearly imply n. would 
spend 13 year stomp around mainland never get close 
wall . 
see ? 
`` clear implication '' totally contrary text , 
reconcile anything want .
