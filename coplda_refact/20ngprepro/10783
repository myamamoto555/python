one usual suggestion put everything shell 
instead one , fair enough 
user know . 
several hundred user 
book tell , though , confuse best . 
another 
run login shell , still leave window manager 
thing get start menu wrong environment . 
alternative instead run client startup script , 
run user 's favorite shell login shell , run 
rest startup script . 
way user 's usual environment get set 
normal inherit everything . 
find copy 
script thing . 
, available 
usual place .
