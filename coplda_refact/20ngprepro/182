would highly amusing , since actually public key partners , 
entity organization hold patent 
claim violate actually `` make , use sell '' pgp . 
believe patent also apply canada , patent 
lawyer anything . 
thing freely code rsa 
use north america without legal entanglement . 
may 
wish consider , however , available ftp 
site probably meet definition 
`` freely '' readily available source , c , 
rsa , md5 , etc. come license allow noncommercial 
use . 
like strong crypto software , exportable 
legally . 
modify permission , 
number people receive past . 
reason 
entirely clear , rsa say u.s. people take 
server , although itar issue regard 
canada . 
distribution site 
distribution , ok canadians .
