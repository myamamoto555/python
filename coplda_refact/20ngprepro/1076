non-existent danger ? 
analogy push argument far 
side . 
melinda 's assume premise use set 
respective analogy true thus correct conclusion arise . 
important point note different direction side come . 
christian believe know truth thus believe right 
duty tell truth . 
christian get offend believe self-evidently 
truth . 
non-christian believe truth get 
offend christian claim know truth . 
btw argument go anyone , bag christian 
neither side really reconcile unless one party change 
mind . 
melinda point , point argue along line 
approach different premise . 
useful line 
discussion people believe particular faith . 
personally , mind anyone believe long allow mine 
live peacefully .
