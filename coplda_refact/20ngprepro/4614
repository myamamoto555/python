jewish 
theology overall quite distinct god

evil god , no-no christian , bible

important question light instance 
passage sodom means . 
either connection 
text , fact exist , interpretation 
, purely arbitrary . 
. 
, question 
one carry burden biblical text one could simply write 
book convey message better . 
might answer one 
becuase peculiar biblical information might lose , 
hold true every book , question remain 
bible still special place ? 
replace somehow ? 

ok bargain dangerous content bible 
message include well ?

read two story bible , one god command people 
kill child another god kill 
child directly , important resolve , message 
child kill god ? 
argument give fallacy , may important 
context give find god corporeal , 
crucial question . 
religious believer resolve contradiction 
choose one possibility give arbitrary way , 
advantage able attribute decision 
god . 
one resolve question statement good 
good depend question .
