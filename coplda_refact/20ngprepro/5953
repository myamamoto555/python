relevant part : 
blank bezel faceplate

note apple 's unfortunate choice name bracket 
mount 5.25 '' device . 
service tech talk say , `` oh sure , 
stock . '' 
course think cd caddie 
hold cd disk stick drive . 
far tell , apple sell bezel faceplate already 
cut standard 5.25 '' device . 
? 
advertise 
machine able accept standard device 
5.25 '' bay , provide faceplate ? 
sell cutout 
cd-rom drive course , use . 
go hack extra bezel order make cutout 
tape drive , standard 5.25 '' device .
