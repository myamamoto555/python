light recent paranoia concern government proposal , would love 
see unix-based encryption scheme : 
1 keep file encrypt host machine say , file 
home directory 
2 use key system could compromise eavesdropping 
modem line . 
seem would require modification shell program 
way tell whether file encrypted , among thing . 
would love know potential security hole system . 
system exist ? 
make easy-to-use readily 
available , think would good thing tm . 
realize 
would probably involve put nice front-end readily available 
secure encryption scheme , . 
thanks ear ,
