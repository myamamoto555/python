; prove existance god disputable 
show people dispute ; easy : dispute 
god exist . 
simple . 
miss `` traditional proof '' treatise , proof remember 
summa 5 way think rather poor

ontological argument billion time better , . 
would think would want non-traditional proof , consider general 
failure traditional proof : least one know .

please show case . 
familiar first cause

first cause , even though find 
questionable . 
rest 'll show .

self-consistent : human must renew relationship , 
god incarnate . 
well , unless think god 
human . 
grant , god make ` human ' , nonetheless cheating : 
intent statement clearly man fix problem 
cause . 
god fix - even indirect means - contradict .

? 
also , assume say claim true anyway ? 
claim truth , bind reason follow ?

undoubtably . 
mean imply obey command 
marines without question ? 
seem imply god , 
marines similar respect . 
. 

try say , please explain say , 
miss .

? 
question ? 
even truth , know 
certainly , irrational question ? 
perhaps 
thus discover wrong . 
assert god truth question truth . 

assert god truth anyway question truth . 
assertion less good ? 
> one may deny truth . 
oh ? 
hereby deny 1 +1 2 . 
hope 'll agree 1 +1 2 truth . 
grant , look pretty damn silly say something like , 
need something agree clearly true . 
, 'll notice stormtrooper march drag

true . 
certainly true . 
least , one newton derive 
true , indeed wildly inaccurate high speed small 
distance . 
set law physics always 
work case . 
, physics would already . 
science question sort truth . 
, 
would still follow aristotle . 
would generalize little : 
want learn anything new , must question thing 
know tm . 
always wrong . 
> therefore , authority truth may deny . 
even presuppose truth may deny , may 
question , god truth , follow 
god may deny question . 
must 
obey ! 
could unquestioningly disobey . 
annoying . 
connect denial disobedience .
