like everyone else , end get two different size 
top bottom . 
top bottom . 

bottom , waist far large , thigh fit right 
46 better waist , cut circulation leg , 
large , muscular thigh , , use thighmaster get 
. 
jacket fit ok chest , slightly snug 
waist , small arm . 
imagine find one-piece 
size would fit correctly , even 2 piece 
problem strange , since jacket fit great , 
try matching pants , fit like glove well . 
assume model aero design use design suit 
way different real folk . 
also , even though related , look pretty damn 
wierd walk around top bottom run errand . 
get really suspicious look , sweat lot 
store wear whole suit , since fit top bottom 
motorcycle storage device yet devise except trunk 
sidecar rig . 
two piece , unzip pants generally 
leave two piece zip together , primarily pants fall 
unless pull cheesy elastic band real tight , 
stuff one spacious bmw saddlebag pants fit , 
run errand wear jacket . 
actually , know 'll 
run errand , wear jacket , ... 
far crash protection , would say suit probably 
equal . 
seem weather protection , anything 2 piece 
provide little jacket overlap pants 
3 inch . 
2 piece probably little less comfortable around 
waist , extra layer stuff , maybe . 
would vote two piece . 
despite slightly odd fit , 
still find suit versatile piece ride clothing 
. 
would go long distance without .
