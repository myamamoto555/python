jesus earth , make amazing prediction 
, frequently repeat . 
let quote : 
behold , go jerusalem ; son 
man shall betray unto chief 
priest unto scribe , shall 
condemn death , shall deliver 
gentiles mock , scourge , 
crucify ; third day shall 
rise '' matthew -19 . 
wholly different normal experience man , jesus , 
never anything worthy death , even deserving 
, know would die 40 year age . 

know city would die . 
know religious 
leader race would condemn death . 
know 
one would betray . 
know actual 
death take place would mock scourge . 
know exactly 
would die -- crucifixion . 

remarkable . 
amazing 
minute particulars foreknowledge predict 
would follow shortly bury -- would rise 
. 
even designate time -- third day . 
since central fact -- death - 
tion jesus christ -- whole truth untruth chris - 
turn , let examine closely . 
body jesus embalm long sheet cloth 
layer great abundance spice 
ointment distribute . 
body place tomb 
never use , great stone roll 
entrance . 
jewish authority , fully aware jesus 
predict would rise , stone officially seal 
saturday place guard tomb prevent 
disciple carry away body . 
early sunday morning 
woman faithful follower christ go 
tomb anoint body . 
utter astonishment , 
find stone roll away , body go . 
rush back 
tell disciple . 
shortly two jesus ' friend , peter 
john , utterly skeptical whole affair , come find 
tomb empty , woman say . 
even guard come 
hurry city tell sanhedrin hire 
guard tomb body go matthew . 
tomb become empty ? 
one famous new testament scholar america -- 
professor new testament literature large theological 
seminary -- write author answer question 
tomb become empty , write letter mark 
bitterness sarcasm , could explain tomb 
become empty could explain santa claus come 
chimney christmas time . 
realize santa clause never come 
chimney christmas time , never santa 
claus ! 
... jesus . 
die ; bury 
tomb joseph arimathea , sunday body go . 
fact history . 
one escape - 
bility come conclusion really happen 
mention myth abandon eight year old . 
another professor , dr. lake harvard university , 
try explain empty tomb say scholar 
field new testament criticism venture adopt 
woman go wrong tomb . 
fact : 
first , far know , tomb nearby 
mistake could go . 
second , contrary similar experience three 
people forget place bury 
dearest love one within less three day . 
even woman 
miss tomb , peter john come , go 
wrong tomb ? 
third , soldier guard wrong tomb ? 
, course , record attempt escape 
evidence empty tomb new testament . 
go , behold , 
watch come city show 
unto chief priest thing 
. 
assemble 
leader take counsel , 
give large money unto soldier , say , 
say ye , disciple come night , steal 
away sleep . 
come 
governor 's ear , persuade , 
secure . 
take money , 
teach : say com - 
report among jews day 
matthew -15 . 
good illustration many later attempt escape 
fact tomb empty . 
notice chief priest elder never 
question tomb empty . 
never even go 
see guard report true -- know true . 
another fact story make ridiculous maintain 
tomb empty -- soldier tell say jesus ' disciple 
come steal body away soldier asleep ! 

could know go asleep ? 
obviously , testimony would valueless court . 
even aside shallowness sordidness make reject 
explanation , character later history 
disciple compel believe steal secretly carry away 
body jesus . 
first , professor heffern point , leader judaism 
jerusalem , put lord jesus death , nothing offer 
contradict disciple continue preach jesus 
resurrection -- jerusalem know tomb empty . 

trickery , sooner later would suspect , 
prove . 
second , surely one disciple , even , would 
confess fraud terrific persecution undergo . 
may possible live lie , man seldom die lie -- 
man . 
result ultimately would message christ 
rise would suffer fate unfounded story -- 
would lose power . 
instead , truth sweep world , close 
pagan temple , win million disciple , bring hope despair 
humanity , foundation truth early church , today 
believable freshly glorious ever . 
jesus come alive , disappear 
leave disciple speculate subsequent day 
happen . 
instead , appear -- literally , visibly , frequently . 
appear woman tomb resurrection morning 
matthew -10 ; later day mary magdalene alone john - 
18 ; simon peter , also alone luke . 
afternoon 
walk two follower toward emmaus luke -35 ; 
night appear ten apostle gather together upper 
room jerusalem mark 16:14 -16 ; luke -40 ; etc. . 
week later appear eleven apostle , probably 
place john -28 . 
see 500 brethren 
mountain galilee corinthians ; finally 
apostle ascension mark 16:19 ; luke -52 ; act 1:3 - 
8 . 
fact empty tomb , regard - 
record appearance , kind theory propose 
attempt deny literalness . 
theory 
unreasonable , without support evidence . 
none ever win 
unanimous approval refuse believe reality 
appearance . 
moreover , true live age may 
lead scientist agnostic many philosopher 
, let forget greatest 
thinker age firmly believe great miracle . 
increase mather , president harvard ; timothy dwight , president yale ; 
nathan lord , president dartmouth ; edward hitchcock , president 
amherst ; mark hopkins , president williams ; john witherspoon , president 
princeton -- man countless believe . 
suppose christ rise dead , ? 

life ? 
life ? 
: 
seal certitude teaching christ . 
jesus teach many great truth -- especially many . 

claim come god . 
say way god . 
say son god , alone know god perfectly . 
say whoever believe eternal life , one 
else . 
say whatever ask god name , would grant 
. 
thus rise grave third day , reveal 
amazing , unparalleled prediction , speak truth ! 

know reason , good reason , believe 
word true ? 
point , truth resurrection convince 
none one claim -- son god ? 
, course , fact christ rise dead 
testify break power death , 
day raise also grave , promise . 
word , person , jesus christ , son god , 
, cornerstone foundation life . 

say life build would know forgiveness sin , compan - 
help , joy circumstance ever take away , 
hope unto perfect day . 
try age -- 
many -- give testimony . 
today believe also know .
