voyager unusual luck stable trajectory 
solar system . 
collect field datum , routinely 
squirt . 
one mariner also stable 
solar orbit , still provide similiar solar datum . 
something planetary orbit , subject much complex force . 
comsats , `` stable '' orbit , require almost daily 
operation . 
occasional deep space bird , like pff pluto , sure 
could leave `` auto-pilot '' . 
thing like galileo 
magellan , would suspect need enough housekeeping 
even untended would end unusable . 
better question . 
transfer o&m bird separate agency continous funding 
support kind ongoing science mission . 
pat 
ongoing op mention , seem always quote operations 
datum analysis . 
much would cost collect datum 
let analyze whenever . 
kinda like landsat datum 
sit around 15 year someone analyze ozone hole . 
even let teh bird drift , may get hose 
cosmic phenomenon .
