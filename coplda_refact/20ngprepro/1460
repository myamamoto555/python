anyone solution ? 
try : flip mouse , open cover hold 
mouse ball place . 
remove ball , inside see 
probably 3 roller . 
roller tiny layer 
dirt , dust , otherwise unidentifiable scum , carefully 
scrape small knife work great . 
careful 
want gauge roller , clean dirt . 
put ball back , put cover , . 
clean couple dozen every month . 
another symptom 
move mouse , seem `` click '' along . 

solve problem , least clean mouse . 
highly 
recommend use proper _ soft _ mouse pad , clean freak , 
place drawer every night use keep 
dust . 
personally prefer track ball . 
oh , bring another point : 
mouse trackball track optically , sunlight 
streaming window onto , may notice 
stop work . 
happen , close curtain 
blind , simply shade point device , see help .
