question answer 
--------------------- 
1 ? 
yet complete , useful implementation privacy 
enhance mail pem . 
allow electronic mail 
four security facility provide pem : disclosure protection 
optional , originator authenticity , message integrity measure , 
non-repudiation origin always . 
see : `` pem ? '' 
write primarily mark riordan < > . 
code public domain , except rsa routine , 
library call license rsa data security inc. . 
current version ; current version 
macintosh port 0.7 . 
2 get ? 
use library cryptographic routine , 
consider munitions thus distribution 
person citizen permanent resident u.s 
canada without export license . 
license obtain 
would one likely grant unless rsa key exchange 
shorten 512 bit symmetric cipher change something 
weaker des . 
suggestion situation may 
change clinton office . 
author request 
readme file law violate : 
export cryptographic code distribution 
usa canada . 
personal request , 
#the author , condition use . 
note public domain , license 
include distribution . 
read use 
. 
available via anonymous ftp citizen permanent 
resident u.s. ; cd read readme 
file info . 
note portion 
product rsa data security , incorporate ; merely help 
distribute . 
, well crypt stuff , `` home site '' 
, open ftp user 
u.s. canada citizen permanent resident . 
find 
obtain access , ftp , cd , read file 
. 
convenience , binary many architecture 
available addition full source tree . 
3 run machine ? 
probably . 
already port flavor 
unix sunos , next , linux , aix , ultrix , solaris , etc. port 
macintosh include standard port rather nice 
port write raymond lau , author stuffit . 
port 
expect , help user invite . 
4 work mailer ? 
probably . 
easy clean effective interface depend 
sophistication modularity mailer , though . 
user 
guide , include distribution , discuss way use 
many popular mailer , include berkeley , mush , elm , mh . 
code also include allow easy use inside gnu 
emac . 
make new interface create improvement one 
distribution believe convenient use , secure , 
may useful , feel free post . 
5 rsa ? 
rsa crypto system asymmetric , public-key . 
mean 
two different , related key : one encrypt one 
decrypt . 
one reasonably derive , 
may publish encryption , public , key widely keep 
decryption , private , key . 
anyone use public 
key encrypt message , hold private key need 
decrypt . 
note `` message '' send rsa normally 
des key real plaintext . 
see `` des ? '' 
note provide disclosure protection . 

originator authenticity , message integrity , non-repudiation 
origin service implement , fingerprint message 
see `` fingerprint , like md5 ? '' 
encrypt 
sender 's private key . 
recipient , 
authority , use sender 's public key decrypt confirm 
message must come sender alter . 
rsa name three man rivest , shamir adleman 
invent . 
find lot rsa modern cryptography 
general , ftp look . 
information 
also may . 
6 des ? 
des data encryption standard , widely use symmetric , 
, crypto system . 
unlike rsa , des use key 
encrypt decrypt message . 
however , des much faster rsa . 
use des rsa ; generate random key encrypt 
mail des use key . 
encrypt key 
recipient 's public rsa key include result letter , 
allow recipient recover des key . 
des sometimes consider weak somewhat old use 
key length consider short modern standard . 
however , 
reasonably safe opponent smaller large 
corporation government agency . 
likely pem 
standard incorporate support symmetric cipher 
near future , strong feeling pem 
stable become utilize widely without early problem 
interoperability . 
7 fingerprint , like md5 ? 
md5 message digest algorithm produce rsa data security inc. . 
provide 128-bit fingerprint , cryptographically secure hash , 
plaintext . 
cryptographically secure 
possible reasonable amount computation produce 
different plaintext produce fingerprint . 
thus , 
instead sign entire message sender 's private key , 
md5 message need sign authentication . 
md5 also exchange directly authentication ; example , 
public key include md5 public key file , 
party wish confirm key authentic via separate 
channel merely need exchange md5 key verify accuracy . 
md5 sometimes use purpose ; example , often 
use map input arbitrary length 128 bit datum , 
passphrase interpreter cookie generator . 
md5 describe entirety include implementation c 
rfc 1321 . 
recent suggestion md5 may strong 
hash originally believe ; presumably hash 
function use accept true . 
8 pem ? 
pem privacy enhance mail , standard allow transfer 
encrypted electronic mail generate long period time 
work group expert . 
describe rfc ; 
document approve obsolete old rfc . 
really complete implementation pem , pem 
specify certificate authenticate key , 
handle time . 
addition plan . 
9 distribute authenticate key ? 
remote user able send secure mail , must know 
public key . 
able confirm message 
receive come , must know public key . 
important 
information accurate ; `` bad guy '' convince 
key fact , send message read . 
allow three method key management : central server , 
distribute finger server , flat file . 
three 
describe user guide part distribution . 
none provide perfect security . 
pem standard call 
key management certificate ; addition feature 
plan , issue still exist . 
10 bad idea use patented algorithm standard like pem ? 
issue consider standard process . 
rfc 1310 , 
specification internet standard , discussion section 
6 specification nondiscriminatory availability must 
meet patented method include standard . 
rfc 1421 
address issue regard patent cover public-key 
cryptography . 
, course , mean question settle 
everyone agreement . 
interesting exchange use 
patented algorithm standard regard public-key 
cryptography league programming freedom archive 
available via ftp : : file 
. 
amusingly , lpf file 
compress patented algorithm . 
11 ? 
rsa data security , inc. california-based company 
specialize cryptographic technology . 
public key partners 
firm hold exclusive rights follow u.s. 
patent corresponding foreign patent : 
cryptographic apparatus method 
`` diffie-hellman '' ... ... ... ... ... ... . 
no. 
public key cryptographic apparatus 
method `` '' ... ... ... ... no. 
cryptographic communications system 
method `` rsa '' ... ... ... ... ... ... ... no. 
exponential cryptographic apparatus 
method `` '' ... ... ... ... no. 
pkp claim four patent cover know method public key 
cryptography . 
two business rather closely related 
example , person , jim bidzos , president . 
pkp license technology considerable number 
company ibm , dec , motorola , at&t , lotus ... use 
product . 
pkp also threaten file lawsuit defend 
patent . 
originally create connection 
use library , reason 
author 's desire see widespread use public-key cryptography . 
however , ball start roll , people get 
interested . 
decide carry ftp site , 
people start make key contribute 
code . 
even win `` best application build 1992 '' 
award . 
12 public key look similar ? 
public key begin pkc public-key cryptography 
standards identifier describe various characteristic 
key , first bunch character key may 
lot people 's key . 
mean key 
similar , class key , 
generate program , length , etc. . 
13 pgp ? 
pgp another cryptographic mail program call pretty good privacy . 
pgp around longer , work somewhat differently . 
pgp compatible way , though pgp also use rsa . 
major difference pgp : 
- pgp key management feature , particularly user without 
direct network connection . 
- conform pem rfc thus greater probability 
work pem software . 
pgp make attempt 
compatible anything . 
- use , library rsa routine 
come license allow noncommercial use . 
pgp use 
implementation rsa . 
pkp claim violation 
patent `` make , use sell '' pgp u.s. canada without 
either license write permission . 
see : `` disclaimer '' 
see : `` ? '' 
phil zimmermann , author 
pgp , stop distribute threaten legal 
action ; believe licensing scheme could arrange , 
happen seem little prospect happen 
future . 
acknowledge pgp user 's guide : 
fact , live usa , federal agency , 
actually run pgp computer , public 
partners want forbid run software . 
pgp 
. 
- pgp , send outside 
u.s. canada without export license . 
however , pgp 
already exist many ftp site europe place . 
whether use pgp whatever , documentation pgp 
recommend read anyone interested issue . 
unfortunately , distribute separately program , 
difficult find u.s. ftp site due 
liability concern . 
14 ? 
stand rabin privacy enhance mail . 
similar , 
use public-key cipher invent rabin rsa 
attempt avoid patent public-key system . 

write mark riordan , later write . 
distribution halt , contrary belief many 
include rabin , pkp claim patent broad enough 
cover cipher employ . 
claim universally 
accept , challenge pragmatic reason . 
really use anymore . 
compatible pgp . 
15 mime ? 
mime stand multipurpose internet mail extensions , 
describe rfc 1341 . 
find newsgroup 
; faq exist . 
pem interact 
mime yet entirely clear ; people use stopgap solution 
mime type order send 
message mime one . 
hope standard emerge . 
draft 
internet document exist matter . 
16 ? 
trust information systems work version privacy 
enhance mail general availability . 
last hear , 
rumor integrate existing mail user agent mh 
rather stand-alone system , beta test . 
know 
much . 
17 simple way defeat security ... 
may wish check companion post `` '' 
discuss obvious attack 's security 
procedure minimize risk . 
's main `` weak area '' 
probably key distribution .
