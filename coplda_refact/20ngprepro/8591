base experience '79 model 
would definitely give new model consideration market . 

older model well build . 
unless toyota lose mind , would 
assume , prove otherwise , newer model inherit 
quality ancestor . 
two major difference run gear aware need study . 
'79 solid front axle housing whereas newer model 
independant front suspension . 
solid axle theoretically stronger 
reliable newer model , experience tell . 

independant front suspension , doubt , compromise make satisfy 
typical user , never need real utility vehicle . 
second 
difference type transfer case use newer model . 

sure , think go full-time 4wd all-wheel drive 
system . 
older `` lock-up '' type . 

advantage disadvantage .
