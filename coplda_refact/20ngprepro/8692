certainly describe situation perfectly . 

constant dynamic tendency eat , appear 
totally limitless , purely conscious desire 
put much weight . 
get fat , 
vary degree success take 
extra weight . 
usually cycle within 15 lb range , 
smaller larger cycle occur well . 
always afraid 
method stop work someday , usually 
seem able hold weight gain check . 
one reason hard time accept notion 
metabolic derangement associate cycle dieting 
result long-term weight gain . 
cycle - 
dieting least 20 year without see change . 
think vigorous exercise program go long way toward 
keep cycle smaller baseline weight low .
