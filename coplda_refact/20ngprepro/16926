agree verse go unchallenged gay rights 
activist . 
zero verse '' ` clearly ' address issue , '' 
mean also verse clearly support 
case ? 
sure want say zero verse clearly 
address issue ? 
however , couple seem though require `` incredibly 
perverse interpretation '' order see condemn homosexuality .

story genesis 19 tell citizen sodom demand opportunity 
`` know '' two man lot 's guest ; fact sodomites become 
angry lot offer daughter could see indicate 
interested homosexual intercourse . 
yes , want 
rape , homosexual rape , everybody agree wrong . 

christian believe homosexual aspect desire 
sinful rape aspect desire . 
passage say 
offended god , whether homosexuality , intend 
rape , , believe fair consider possible 
alternative light related scripture . 
believe 
believe god offend homosexuality rape try 
say homosexuality form rape . 
seem take view sin describe gen. 19 
fact sodomites want commit rape , unfair 
`` stigmatize '' homosexuality associate sin rape . 

see might reach conclusion start conclusion 
nothing wrong homosexuality , 
suppose start conclusion circular reasoning . 

god fact oppose homosexual intercourse general , 
probably interpretation least offend sodomites ' 
blatant homosexuality intent commit rape . 
later 
document believe old testament portray god one despise 
homosexual intercourse , even partner consent adult . 
'' ... deceive ; neither , idolator , adulterer , 
effeminate , homosexual , thief , covetous ,

, swindler , shall inherit kingdom god .

moderator find proposal circular regard church 
proper authority determine kind marriage would 
legitimate , thus church 's refusal recognize `` pervert '' marriage 
circular reasoning . 
question , however , nothing 
church ordain new kind marriage , argument something 
straw man . 
term original question , precise 
`` '' really important , unless 
try argue bible really condemn extramarital sex . 

sure moderator try . 
case , think moderator miss point . 
jesus ask divorce , reply , `` read , 
create beginning make male female , say , ` 
cause man shall leave father mother shall cleave wife ; 
two shall become one flesh ' ? 
consequently longer two , one 
flesh . 
therefore god join together , let man separate . '' 
mt. 
-6 . 
read sexual union man male wife 
female union . 
word , institution 
heterosexual marriage something ordain establish god -- man , 
church , god . 
man suppose dissolve 
union , jesus ' word , something create man . 
circular reasoning , read god 's word . 
read 
bible god ordain union male female . 
read 
similar union two male two female . 
grant , 
uninspired man ordain `` alternative '' union caligula 
report `` marry '' horse ? 
, union jesus refer 
`` god join together '' heterosexual union man 
wife . 
pardon mention caligula . 
know probably inflammatory , 
save discussion bestiality , part 2 post . 
please hold pass judgement read section 
reply . 
anyway , original question whether translate `` '' 
way condemn select kind extramarital sex , question : 
give heterosexual marriage union describe bible 
, give biblical prohibition sex outside 
marriage , homosexual intercourse sinful ? 
course , see first 
need ask whether bible really condemn sex outside marriage . 

seem try argue certain kind extramarital sex 
sin really wrong : 
think agree paul kind

alternatively , may definition term `` '' 
rest , paul 's day , would call faq ; i.e. law , 
`` tutor '' appoint god lead christ , spend sixteen 
century drum head god 's people idea thing like 
homosexual intercourse abomination deserve punishment death . 
perhaps paul go detail `` '' & c 1600 
year consider question deal already . 
perhaps 
reason god 's apostle prophet devote great deal time define 
distinct , new testament sexuality intend 
significant change sexuality already establish law . 
'll discuss law homosexuality greater detail , 
want point new testament 's failure develop detailed new 
standard sexuality necessarily evidence god care 
sexual conduct -- especially 1600 year put people death 
practice homosexuality !

define `` obsessively drive '' mode sexual behavior ? 

determine difference obsessive sexual behavior normal sex 
drive ? 
desire `` sinful '' sex obsessively drive mode 
behavior ? 
think see circular reasoning : define 
sinful ? 
obsessive . 
make obsessive ? 
fact 
person drive seek even though sinful . 
obsessive 
desire society condemn ? 
, 
circular : define obsessive ? 
person want even 
though society condemn . 
society condemn ? 

obsessive . 
seem try limit bible 's condemnation `` '' 
`` pervert '' sex act , think really define `` pervert '' 
without fall exactly circularity accuse . 
, 
, paul condemn declare `` ... shall enter 
heaven '' ?

think misunderstand : try make argument 
technical definition `` '' , raise issue sinfulness 
extramarital sex lack scriptural evidence homosexual 
counterpart union heterosexual couple .

glad ask . 
would agree god condemn homosexual 
intercourse even among law moses , 
would show god 's condemnation homosexual act go beyond ritual 
law ? 
show scripture god punish homosexual 
behavior people law moses , would agree 
god 's definition homosexual intercourse abomination limit 
ritual law law ? 
private email discussion 7th day adventist 
subject sabbath , main point christian 
requirement nowhere scripture god command gentile 
rest sabbath , ever condemn gentile fail rest 
sabbath . 
illustrate difference universal requirement 
`` thou shalt kill '' , requirement merely part 
temporary , law moses , sabbath . 
point try make think classification 
homosexual intercourse `` abomination '' part temporary , 
law moses . 
hand believe label 
god abomination gentile well jews , punish 
guilty behavior death exile . 
's : 
back genesis 15 , god promise give abraham land 
possession `` amorite '' -- kinda hard amorite , think ? 
verse 16 clue might unjust sound : 
seem god go postpone takeover quite , `` 
iniquity amorite yet complete '' . 
remember , long ritual law . 

iniquity amorite commit , complete , would justify 
cast land kill ? 
go back look lev . 
18 
. 
verse 1-23 list variety sin , include child sacrifice , incest , 
homosexuality , bestiality . 
begin verse 24 , god start say , `` 
defile thing ; _ _ _ thing _ 
nation cast _ _ _ _ . 

land become defile , therefore visit punishment upon , 
land spew inhabitant ... whoever 
abomination , person shall cut among 
people . '' 
notice god say gentile nation ritual law 
mose punish `` defile '' 
land commit `` abomination '' include incest , bestiality , 
homosexuality . 
flip ahead two chapter lev . 
20 , find 
`` abomination '' list , time god decree death penalty 
anyone involve thing , include , specifically , man `` lie 
another man one lie woman '' lv . 
20:13 . 

`` '' upon , mean god 's eye , deserve 
die thing . 
accord lev . 
18:26 -29 , even `` alien 
non-jew sojourn among '' refrain practice , 
penalty `` cut god ? 
among people . '' 
circumstance , believe would difficult support 
claim old testament god object intended rape , 
homosexuality , sodom . 
since god take trouble specifically list 
sex two consent man one reason wipe 
canaanite nation , homosexual rape , mind , plain , voluntary gay 
sex , would say god neutral subject homosexual behavior , even 
nothing mosaic covenant . 
> christian think part leviticus 
> `` law '' christian even think 
> incumbent every case , handle merit 
> determine `` pick '' one ignore another . 
accord ii tim . 
3:16 , scripture inspire god profitable 
teaching , reproof , correction , training righteousness ; thus , 
believe even though gentile christian law , 
learn study . 
certain action define sin 
violation law , sin law 
example , case . 
god reveal certain 
action abomination even law , 
conclude god 's objection practice base whether 
person law , sinfulness act . 
case 
homosexuality , homosexual intercourse define god defile 
abomination gentile well jews , i.e. 
law well . 
thus , try say 
gentile christian obligation keep part law , simply 
say god refer homosexuality sin even 
obligate keep law . 
, think appeal 
exemption law valid grounds legitimize practice god 
declare abomination defile jew gentile .
