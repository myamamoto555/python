pink noise random signal low-frequency component 
white noise . 
look frequency spectrum white noise frequency 
analyzer , find spectrum power density flat , 
means every frequency present noise signal . 
often pink noise obtain white noise integrate low-pass 
filter white noise signal . 
therefore pink noise contain much 
low-frequency component . 
effect pink noise sometimes use simulate thunder roaring 
animal . 
additional low-pass filter variable cutoff frequency 
explain . 
enjoy .
