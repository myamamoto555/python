well , since wife gentle term `` bastard '' , 
probably speak bit authority . 
`` stigma '' 
associate child conceive bear wedlock rest 
solely upon parent -- commit sexual transgression 
repent . 
child priori limitation 
; indeed , concept blame child 
parent ' sin one mormons would find appalling ; note ld 
theology reject original sin , term usually define , 
subsequent need infant baptism cf. moroni 8 book 
mormon . 
indeed , ld doctrine go one step case 
hold parent responsible child 's sin 
fail bring properly cf. d&c -28 ; note 
passage apply member lds church . 
also note `` big genealogical book salt lake city '' . 
lds church massive storage facility nearby mountain 
contain microfilm vital statistic record birth , christen , 
baptism , marriage , death gather entire world . 

may , believe record 2 
billion people vault . 
time , lds church 
build on-line genealogical database . 
neither case 
kind `` worthiness screening '' whether someone 
enter . 
potential issue establish 
parent , would apply case database .

follow arrive separate post -- 
follow-up follow-up -- lest anyone misunderstand , term 
`` bastard '' one never 25 year lds church 
membership hear apply , formally informally , child bear 
wedlock , indeed would rightly consider vulgar , 
offensive term . 
would echo expression reply , 
except hope poster would recognize offensive nature 
word give context . 
unfortunately , post 
reply , remember subtle point often lose ` net , 
figure would better spell .
