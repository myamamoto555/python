talk device e.g. hd controller . 
rewrite mac & info sheet section : 
scsi : external device expansion interface common mac ibm . 
allow use device : hard drive , printer , scanner , nubus card 
expansion mac plus , monitor , cd-rom . 
normal asynchronous 
scsi 5 mhz ; fast synchronous scsi 10 mhz . 
difference 
mode mainly software driver . 
main problem : lot external device internal 
terminate cause problem two devise scsi port 
chain suppose terminate begining end . 
set cause problem either mac ibm . 
: 8-bit ; 7 device per controller . 
asynchronous ~ 1.5 ave 
synchronous max transfer . 
8-bit often mistaken 
fast version see detail . 
: fully compliant . 
mode - 10 device per controller . 
8-bit fast since run use 
hardware software driver limit 7 device , 
result sometimes mistakenly part . 
16-bit 
32-bit require different port , electronics , scsi software 
driver make expensive 
interface . 
32-bit seem run synchronous mode , hence term 
` wide fast ' transfer speed burst 8-bit , 
burst 16-bit , burst 
32-bit . 
8-bit biggest headache due fact 
know pump speed device software 
. 
main mac though see add 
maximum throughput pc . 
since 8-bit 
need hardware include software 16-bit 32-bit 
interface . 
pop 
pop 8-bit electronics . 
people consider 
16-bit really start use one 
average though put theoretical burst 
8-bit . 
rule thumb : type . 
8-bit scsi use part electronics reduce cost 
compare 16 32-bit .
