concession mansbridge cbc news , argue ` re 
go play havoc schedule , least make sure 
prime time air soon possible . 
news get commitment 
post-game show would scrap network would go ptn within 
one minute game end . 
earlier comment cbc `` '' frankly 
doubleheader decison go way , people west cant see 
leafs people central canada see jet game . 

reason decision cbc 's feeling could sell advertising 
six hour hockey one night . 
want see news hockey , lot people . 
cbc always get 
plenty complaint juggle news schedule .
