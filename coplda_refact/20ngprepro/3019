maybe baseball business 
responsible fiscal aspect game preach gloom doom . 
allegedly intelligent people seem predict bad time , lose 
money , bankruptcy alarming rate , go 
increase degradation product produce . 
could imagine 
ibm , problem , promote way major league 
baseball ? 
stock would plummet unthinkable depths 
far . 
would happen gm ? 

would gm admit cut corner produce 
inferior product allege labor problem ? 
think show 
lack confidence people run game . 
> anyway , frustrate media say thing , 
> inevitably lead owner try quick fix like increase play-off 
> satisfy television try interleague play drum interest . 
forget .

deal . 
decide soon since negotiation 
network also begin soon .
