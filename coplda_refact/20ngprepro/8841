may patent like . 
apple patent implementation region , presumably 
include internal datum structure never officially 
document apple . 
apple patent concept region . 
guess either reverse-engineered apple 's internal datum 
structure region dunno would hold court , 
come datum structure . 
latter , 
able draw pict file contain region . 
besides pict file , 
many place region store disk . 
quicktime 
movie , perhaps ? 
long region store disk 
transfer mac clone vice versa , 
matter use completely different internal datum structure . 
remember read apple also patent adb hardware , 
clone would therefore lack adb port . 

patent apple mac ?
