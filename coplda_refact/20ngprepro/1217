boy , embarass trivial faq : 
give 4 point non coplanar , one find sphere , , 
center radius , exactly fitting point ? 
know 
circle 3 point , immediately see 
straightforward way 3-d . 
check 
geometry book , graphic gem , farin , still loss ? 
please mercy provide solution ?

: - 
good bad feeling problem special case 
solution worry . 
four coplanar point shape square unique sphere 
surface . 
similarly 4 point finite size sphere 
surface . 
algorithm geometrical design rather algebraically design 
meet problem neatly . 
determine plane 3 point 
algorithm afil return infinite r. 
intersect two line 2 possibility 
line 4 point planar circle 
different line parallel . 
sphere radius . 
last case achieve 3 point 4th point 
take 4th point pair first 3 parallel line produce 
also achieve 
4 point coplanar one circle . 
seem algorithm fail 4 point coplanar . 
algorithm always fail point coplanar . 
4 point > coplanar 
test 4th point coplanar plane first 3 point 
find trivial .

three pair form three plane , intersect 
> point . 
might easier implement .
