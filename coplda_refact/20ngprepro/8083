. 
opinion ? 
doctor right . 
best nothing , besides take pain 
medication initially . 
patient like expect , demand , 
something . 
case physician `` tape '' 
patient put lot heavy adhesive tape around chest , prescribe 
elastic binder . 
make harder breath , 
patient feel cheated , 
problem . 
either way , end result .
