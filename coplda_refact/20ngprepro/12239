post internet professional courtesy . 
somehow manage 
delete vitamin post text file . 
gordon r. promise send 
back pretty mad right 'll retype . 
since digging reference time consuming take 
day pms post , go cite reference gordon r. 
. 
go include material 
morgan 's new nutrition textbook original material 
point go say support medical 
community . 
diet know affect immune system man , long 
time . 
protein always biggest role infection ` ve 
already cover role protein protect infection . 
go hit consider important nutrient 
u.s. far infection concerned vitamin . 
vitamin originally discover , commonly refer 
vitamin . 
many people linus pauling one 
decide take title away vitamin give vitamin c 
already cover . 
big mistake opinion . 
vitamin 
also get reputation anti-cancer vitamin good reason . 
nci currently numerous clinical trial progress see 
vitamin prevent cancer cure well . 
role 
cancer infection almost identical quite . 
vitamin come two completely different form retinol 
beta-carotene . 
retinol animal form toxic , beta-carotene 
plant form completely nontoxic . 
retinol beta - 
carotene display good absorption human gut bile present 
60-80 % . 
liver store retinol dole 
tissue use synthesize retinol binding protein rbp . 
normal human 
adult liver 500,000 iu 1,000,000 iu retinol store . 

bear 10,000 iu liver . 
u.s. autopsy show 
30 % americans die less amount vitamin 
bear . 
believe nutritional reserve like 
retinol liver important , low vitamin reserve 
go affect . 
believe like nutrient 
reserve important , problem vitamin u.s. 
u.s. rda vitamin adult male 1,000 re 5,000 iu 
vitamin a. adult 800 re 4,000 iu vitamin a. diet 
survey show americans get amount vitamin 
either retinol beta-carotene diet . 
nrc national 
research council go release new rda table 1985 
rda vitamin vitamin c raise c per day 
7,500 iu per day adult male . 
report recommendation 
kill . 
? 
concern increase supplementation main 
reason . 
rda set prevent clinical disease , keep nutrient 
reserve full . 
many scientist u.s. feel time come 
move away prevention clinical pathology concept move 
towards promotion optimum health concept , especially since 
good datum show nutrient reserve extremely 
important period stress . 
win 
battle new group scientist collect come 
1989 rda list lower rda several nutrient move 
dietary guideline back first start 
1940 's get enough prevent clinical pathology , enough fill 
reserve . 
know autopsy 10 % americans liver 
normal vitamin reserve 500,000 iu 1,000,000 iu . 
preach nutrient 
reserve student tell measure patient . 
vitamin , liver biopsy autopsy datum tell 
much somebody store . 
tell easily someone 
liver vitamin measure retinol 
level level highly suggestive fill 
liver vitamin time stop take retinol . 
normal 
range serum retinol dl . 

diagnose serum retinol level 2,000 higher interpretation 
diagnostic test , wallach , m.d. , little brown series book . 
level 
vitamin blood mean medical attention necessary due 
vitamin toxicity . 
morgan take much conservative 
approach vitamin toxicity wallach , see later 
post . 
2,000 plenty 
warn time eliminate retinol diet headache , 
redness skin , hair loss , joint pain . 
tell student use vitamin practice 
better monitor serum retinol level stop clear 
sign liver full . 
never really know patient 
need vitamin measure pool liver 
always know time stop like vitamin 
pm study . 
beta-carotene take fill liver retinol 
never worry toxicity conversion beta-carotene 
retinol occur gut liver slow stop 
liver slow gut liver full retinol . 

take beta-carotene source retinol take long time 
fill liver see estimate 20-30 year 30 % 
much bear liver 10,000 iu . 
one 
problem beta-carotene , zinc deficit , 
convert much beta-carotene retinol gut liver 
conversion require zinc . 
addition , release 
retinol liver zinc dependent process zinc deficit 
cause vitamin deficit even liver plenty vitamin a. 
vitamin cancer infection protection ? 
body 
use vitamin retinol many different thing . 
vision first 
nail see overt clinical pathology use aldehyde 
retinal alcohol retinol form vitamin a. reproduction use 
retinol form retinal . 
infection cancer protection use 
retinoic acid . 
convert retinol white blood cell 
mucosal cell get blood retinoic acid ? 
use enzyme , 
one require vitamin c pauling try pull 
title vitamin away vitamin . 
vitamin c play 
role infection interferon production example biggest role 
conversion retinol retinoic acid . 
increase intake 
vitamin c , increase formation retinoic acid . 

retinoic acid convert back retinol retinal 
form , use lose body . 
1985 nrc 
group want increase vitamin c vitamin rda 's . 
people take large amount vitamin c really think 
help . 
much vitamin liver 
also increase intake vitamin , actually 
harm good . 
retinoic acid function white blood cell promote antibody formation . 
mucus membrane , main factor promote good mucus 
production good epithelial cell barrier prevent infectious agent 
enter blood system . 
mucus membrane refer `` first 
line '' defense infection . 
cancer , retinoic acid show 
act cell brake counteract effect cell promoter 
stimulate cell divide . 
cancer two distinct step , dna alteration 
cell promotion . 
cell normally divide time , promoter 
important . 
lung breast tissue 
normally divide , promoter real important malignant process . 
major reason nci many different clinical trial 
progress use retinol beta-carotene . 
chronic infection irritation mucus membrane signal 
vitamin may adequate . 
tell student patient 
walk office complaint chronic infection 
work vitamin along factor medicine already 
list cause chronic infection . 
drive home 
course osteopathic college tulsa , teach allopathic 
medical school tulsa ou 's branch campus give cme lecture . 
dark adaptation best clinical test vitamin status since night 
vision impact liver drop 50,000 iu retinol . 

serum level retinol also use , drop liver 
reserve drop 10,000 20,000 iu . 
ask patient 
trouble see night good initial screen cataract rule 
. 
one study u.s. serum retinol level 
measure , 25 % sample population serum retinol level 
. 
study serum retinol level population group 
u.s. history high infection rate , probably 
see much correlation infection incidence rate low 
serum retinol level . 
morgan say vitamin ? 
excerpt 
book : 
vitamin function vision retinol , 
growth epithelial tissue , require 
reproduction , embryonic development , bone growth . 

malnutrition zinc deficiency may impair absorption , transport , 
metabolism vitamin a. convert retinoic acid , 
biological activity growth cell 
reproduction vision . 
common procedure evaluate vitamin 
status measure retinol level plasma serum . 
normal 
range vitamin content child 20 . 
lower value 
indicator deficiency deplete body store . 
serum level greater 
indicative toxic level vitamin a. dark adaptation 
test measurement also useful difficult 
perform young child . 
rapidly proliferate tissue sensitive 
vitamin deficiency may revert undifferentiated state . 

tract , skin , genitourinary system , gastrointestinal 
tract sweat gland adversely affect . 
daily intake 
7.5 mg 37,000 iu retinol advise chronic use amount 
100,000 iu result dry itching skin , desquamation , 
erythematous dermatitis , hair loss , joint pain , chap lip , 
bony , headache , anorexia , edema fatigue . 
recommend retinol via im injection child vitamin 
deficiency discuss treatment adult . 
toxic serum retinol 
level conservative . 
recommend student try 25,000 iu 
adult problem chronic infection . 
rule 
zinc deficit first get rbc zinc run clinical 
lab run , tell morgan suggest , give 
zinc along vitamin a. 25,000 iu per day , toxicity 
problem worry pull 
patient office regular basis run serum retinol . 
elaine jon find doctor use much higher dose vitamin a. 
recall pms papers use 100,000 iu 200,000 iu vitamin a. 
suggest student use high dose . 
want 
fill liver fast part clinical trial monitor 
serum retinol level , would okay . 
knowledge 
vitamin literature suggest 25,000 iu patient 
demonstrate vitamin deficit dark test serum retinol 
provide good steady improvement long zinc vitamin c status 
good without worry toxicity . 
want get 
agressive , fine follow advise check serum retinol . 

vitamin retinol never give high dose woman could 
become pregnant since vitamin show teratogenicity towards human 
fetus . 
dose need show effect develop fetus 
18,000 iu retinol per day . 
beta-carotene never effect 
human fetus . 
could take beta-carotene instead retinol supplement help ? 
yes 
effect take long time develop . 
advise use 
retinol fill liver switch beta-carotene keep 
full . 
vitamin probably one nutrient better leave 
prescription doctor . 
m.d. 's newsgroup 
jump doctor propose use vitamin 
supplement treat patient chronic sinus gi distress , 
think prudent option keep vitamin otc market 
require provide package insert educate general 
public danger vitamin supplementation .
