think ! 
scsi card dma transfer disk ... 
scsi card dma transfer contain datum scsi device 
attach want . 
important feature scsi ability detach device . 
free 
scsi bus device . 
typically use multi-tasking os 
start transfer several device . 
device seek datum 
bus free command datum transfer . 
device 
ready transfer datum aquire bus send datum . 
ide bus start transfer bus busy disk seek 
datum transfer . 
typically second lock 
process want bus irrespective transfer time .
