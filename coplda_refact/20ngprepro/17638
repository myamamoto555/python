# extremely poor argument , 's .

# premise 1 : '' ... money pay either big -

# 
# thus monthly appearance buck , happen , 
# observation , construction , evidence

# 
# trouble , basis premise 2 , say evidence 
# either benefactor bug , first premise lead 
# conclusion appearance buck , happen , evidence 
# existence either benefactor bug . 
# 
# voila , scream contradiction . 
# 
# highlight - sc

evidence benefactor , bug . 
# > observation distinguish benefactor bug possible .

# 
still contradictory . 
reduce 
# 
# 1 : dosh arrive account due benefactor bug . 
# 
# 2 : evidence benefactor , neither evidence 
# bug meaning lend weight one 
# 
# 
# 3 : therefore evidence exist benefactor evidence 
# exist bug . 
# 
3 rely shift mean 2 . 
say paraphrase 
2 `` evidence benefactor '' , example , 
evidence benefactor bug . 
yes , mean . 
3 , however , shift meaning `` evidence benefactor '' 
mean ` absolute ' `` evidence benefactor '' rather 
# ` relative ' `` evidence benefactor '' bug . 
really , mean evidence would tend one . 

think communication problem . 
try say , 
clumsy way , buy theory far relate 
theism make prediction prayer , ` rapture ' example , 
buy use occam 's razor case 0 . 
example , one could dismiss 
benefactor bug grounds simplicity - one necessary 
explain dosh . 
bring ` one-by-one dismissal ' process 
show would wrong . 
say 
post , seem agree , talk . 
# 3 still contradiction 1 . 
# 
sum may help . 
b benefactor , b bug , d dosh arrive account : 
# 
# 1 imply p b + b | d 1 
# 
p bb | d 0 , either benefactor bug 
responsible buck arrive , , 
# 
# p b + b | d p b | d + p b | d 
# 

# 
# p b | d + p b | d 1 
# 
3 imply 
# 
# p b | d 0 p b | d 0 . 
, mean . 
p b | d 0.5 p b | d 0.5 , 
necessarily new observation already see dosh change 
estimate . 
try say , clumsy way 
would _ wrong _ assign 0 probability either . 

precisely use razor case god - god 
one class hypothesis many belong set 
hypothesis _ _ necessary explain something otherwise 
would _ _ satisfactorily explain . 
throw 
retain grounds non-rational preference , science statistics . 
alternatively , one could chuck retain lot , grounds 
answer know , notional probability estimate 
effectively useless , equal atheism . 
# > set m fill `` universe cause x '' , 
# > x god , pink unicorn , nothing , etc. . 
- observation 
# > tend one conclusion . 
# 
point make , think . 
`` throw '' 
, contrary assertion . 
people , simon , think excellent science . 
sole point . 
# observation directly contradict hypothesis h i.e. x 
# p x | h 0 cause p h go zero finite 
# number observation . 
case get throw 
# hypothesis . 
# 
# > exactly point , though may unclear . 
# 
say diametric opposite , guess source confusion . 
merely try illustrate incorrectness . 
# > try say correct say absence 
# > evidence sometimes evidence absence , hold true 
# > , perhaps , version theism - true 
# > hold discard use razor . 
# 
contrary , hold exactly 
discard use razor . 
see post branch 
. 
seem guilty contradiction accuse . 

razor hold god , hold like hypothesis . 

means assign p x | h 0 , though already 
establish correct sum p x | h 1 
i. 
# > simply put , anyone claim viable proof existence 
# > non-existence god , whether inductive , best mistaken , 
# > worst bark mad . 
# 
make claim , specifically say much numerous 
. 
would construct , would frank ? 
, course , rule bark mad case 
# could bark mad spare time , apology cleese et al . 
# 
think miss point . 
say something 
# `` evidence '' hypothesis , imply observation 
#the say something necessarily falsify hypothesis , reduce 
p h | datum zero . 
reduce quantity , still 
h. 
, get . 
talk case 0 . 
clearly 
correct ! 
0 . 
construct though 
certainly possible misunderstand say . 
however , 
standard , system say 0 , god highly unlikely , 
! 
0 god dismiss use razor , system purport 
inductive proof god either exist , unnecessary 
explain phenomenon . 
experience , system 
include purport prove god exist always contain 
fallacy upon close examination . 
say , 
please put straight .
