people write bible bible write , 
evidence love , cultural bias . 

poor answer need rebut . 
pull old bait switch . 
think use bible judge man , god . 
mean , moral intuition like 
describe bible , realize thing go 
. 
avoid semantic argument cause evil 
ask fight ? 
specifically , 
everyone , include . 
like genocide 
bible , genocide go right ? 
move beyond question hell , realize many people 
right suffer . 
think hell fair 
willing sacrifice everything deny existence , 
life fair ? 
right young mother 
three little kid know get 
day . 
right sixth grader junkie . 
right old man friend money 
fix tv . 
instead god help ask 
help . 
think correct challenge christian 
live life compassion seem possess . 
want evidence god . 
find someone make difference , 
someone admire , someone tough time 
come head . 
ask person . 
ask 
vietnam vet battle medic keep mind . 
ask 
woman pregnant 15 , keep baby successful 
business woman . 
ask doctor operate pound 
baby . 
christian , even might 
call religious , something common . 
god define bible , god define 
people 's heart . 
matter give 
intellectual assent description hear , ` re 
wrong anyway . 
compassion already feel heart 
step right direction . 
follow instead . 
come back read bible 'll see 
thing describe .
