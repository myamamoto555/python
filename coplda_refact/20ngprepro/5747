much fear escapism , , quite simply , way improve 
social life , get involve american culture , kid 
immigrant example . 
since overwhelming major religion 
western world form , simply choice people take 
bore want something new life , 
new , ordinary . 
seem little weak , long 
hurt anybody ...

set abstract treat : 
desire hurt notion .

step person take naturally , almost , `` instinctively '' ... 
best regard ,

think good simply 
claw . ''
