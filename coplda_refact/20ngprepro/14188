boeing look several vehicle carry 
extensive conceptual study advanced launch system 
time . 
good reference might : `` comparison propulsion 
option advanced eto application - 
. '' 
v.a. weldon l.e. fink boeing . 
paper 
describe launch system claim achieve 
operational efficiency without problem 
associate liquid hydrogen fuel . 
basically , high-speed 
airplane launch spaceplane 
design concept also call `` beta '' lay 
paper launch least 10,000 pound polar orbit , 20,000 
pound space station orbit include crew eight person 
life support . 
system design reliability .9995 . 
beta first stage power two large ramjet 
12 high - speed civil transport turbofan . 
108-foot - 
long reusable orbiter belly first - 
stage aircraft , also could accommodate longer heavy 
payload expendable second stage . 
launch orbital vehicle , first stage take like 
normal accelerate mach 3 . 
point turbofan , 
modify burn catalyze , would shut ramjet , 
would take . 
mach 5.5 orbiter elv would swing 
, ignite proceed orbit . 
vehicle would land like 
aircraft conclusion respective mission . 
estimate total weight combined configuration takeoff 
1.5 m lb , roughly fully load an-225 . 
orbiter stage weigh 400 , include 335 
lox propane power two 250 vacuum thrust 
rocket engine . 
propellant would store 91 degree kelvin , 
propane spherical tank mount forward - 
25-foot cargo bay two-seat orbiter crew station . 
lox would 
store aft . 
weldon fink claim key design 's 
success structurally efficient airframe compact 
tankage allow high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel . 
paper compare design ssto design . 
conclude 
ssto slightly lower recur cost , easier , 
cheaper , less risky develop , simpler build , greater 
safety mission versatility carry 
bulky hydrogen fuel . 
`` conjunction major 
use airplane type engine fuel , well inherent self - 
ferry capability , probably system likely provide 
close operation possible practical 
configuration , single stage concept 
show operationally viable . '' 
> really news ? 
threaten work dc - ? 
weldon boeing work design 
time . 
expect , similar concept perhaps 
ssto propose sdio ssto first phase re - 
examine basis bid first phase . 
threaten dc - ??? 
. 
possibly -- set on-going 
study try straighten government 's future space 
transportation strategy . 
mdc boeing well firm 
provide datum joint study team back dc . 

various faction option vie attention -- include 
shuttle upgrade , shuttle replacement call `` 4-2-3 '' 
architecture , , elv upgrade , various advanced 
vehicle ale , beta , dc - ?? 
, nasp , fst , ssto several type , 
etc. try put together coherent strategy 
future us gov ' space transportation system , try 
juggle near-term launch need like dod nasa 
medium-term need include commercial consideration , 
investment risk go `` leap frog '' new technology 
like nasp beta . 
heck problem . 
worst part problem 
promising idea concept -- dozen 
-- balance cost risk versus real need 
near term . 
draft report mid-june , 
final report come end fiscal year .
