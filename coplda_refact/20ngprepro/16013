wood fairly small . 
mean , fleury pretty good 
job large , dody fleury . 
witness three four fight closeup , simply 
ready fight nhl level assume role , 
really show game k.c. -- pass , shoot 
skate , never see much . 
right fist , bad , 
nhl level , player smart enough grab thing 
land anything significant . 
control hand , 
fish flop beach player anything 
want . 
entire strategy seem keep hand reach 
find opening -- never see find opening worth 
talk . 
get neutralize quickly , stomp couple time . 
unless show new trick camp , 'll `` career minor 
leaguer '' list . 
since first taste nhl , expect 
shark give would know would work off-season . 

need get stronger , need get speed need show 
versatility something else simply , 
particularly good goon .
