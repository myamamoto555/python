cheap solar charger keep car . 
purchase via 
mail order catalog 4 year old battery oldsmobile would 
run summer ride bike drive car . 
know would sell car year , purchase charger . 
believe , thing work . 
battery hold charge 
energetically start car , many time 4 5 week 
sit . 
eventually purchase new battery anyway winter sun 
strong enough due low angle . 
think pay $ 29 $ 30 charger . 
powerful , 
expensive one , purchase cheapest one could find . 
never use bike e-z charger 
keep plug time bike garage .
