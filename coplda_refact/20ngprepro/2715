would say thing dodgers '65 ' 66 ? 
true , 
cone probably good drysdale , koufax , still , 
team win home run leader bad total , 
lot low-scoring game , etc. . 
use reliever , whereas 
jeff montgomery super season . 
say , still pick 5th , think superb 
pitch team win enough hit . 

chance , think , team tremendous hit 
pitch . 
least , . 
wonder , though - one people think would better - team 
johnson , koufax prime , seaver , carlton , young , real 
order , starter , sutter , fingers , lyle bullpen , 
puny offense assume good defense , like mazeroski , maranville , etc. . 
team poor pitching , offense cobb , carew , ruth , gehrig , 
mays , schmidt , wagner , bench - , pick order . 
would postulate pitch one would several game better 
season ' end . 
even best hitter succeed time 
best year , great pitcher throw lot shutout - take 
player prime , might throw 50 shutout year . 

offense would get 1 run across . 
wonder someone something could plug - 
time team regular season , play , report result 
would love see .
