`` orthodox '' compound word . 
come ` ortho ' straight , true , 
right ` doxa ' opinion , doctrine , teaching . 
use orthodox 
refer ` right teaching . ' 
right teaching derive let god 
speak bible . 
read simple truth 
scriptures use bible interpret bible . 
ra > `` hold '' luke mean say mean ? 
think apparent read scriptures 
pertinent . 
luke record christ 's promise repentant thief hang 
adjacent cross : `` truly say , today 
paradise . '' 
later christ rise dead 
ascend heaven ? 
christ heaven 
sunday , could repentant thief ? 

answer lie location `` paradise '' jesus die . 
apparently paradise exalt heaven easter day . 
jesus refer middle story rich man 
lazarus `` abraham 's bosom , '' godly beggar lazarus 
carry angel decease luke 16:19 -31 . 
thus 
`` abraham 's bosom '' refer place soul redeem 
wait till day christ 's resurrection . 
yet lift heaven may well section 
hade hebrew : sheol , reserve believer die faith 
would admit glorious presence god heaven 
price redemption actually pay calvary ; 
even none would precede presence jesus back glory 
father . 
doubtless infernal paradise soul jesus 
repentant thief repair die friday afternoon . 

sunday , rise christ first appear mary magdalene 
john 20:17 two companion matthew , presumably 
take glory inhabitant infernal paradise 
include abraham , lazarus , repentant thief . 
read 
ephesians 4:8 concern christ : `` ascend high , lead captivity 
captive ; give gift unto man . '' 
verse 9 continue : `` ` 
ascend ' mean also descend lowest part 
earth ? '' 
- i.e. , hade . 
verse 10 add : `` descend 
ascend heaven . '' 
presumably lead whole 
band liberated captive hade i.e. , whole population 
paradise glory heaven .

think characterization faulty . 
whenever ` personal 
interpretation ' question , usually give reason . 
see thing differently , please , put forward 
valid difference , discuss . 
seem see notion difference one 
view bible somehow legitimate , except , course , stuff 
glean . 
put forward contrary view perhaps 
discussion topic . 
decry something put 
forward , without put forward something else discuss , 
dismiss put forward give credence alleged view 
yet put forward simply contentious . 
ra > simply assume one really 
ra > understand ? 
believe something draw scripture 
wrong , please , show scripture wrong . 
simply 
state view proof . 
show 
scripture go .
