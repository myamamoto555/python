sell '86 sprint last april . 
would drive since 
previous july , put 20k mile . 
sensor light use 
light regularly , start 5k mile buy . 
brother rebuild engine use original equipment , 
suppose sensor could use replacement . 
performance hah , 
could call change . 
perhaps emission increase , 
much emission could 3 cylinder engine produce ? 
neat car , hold engine block easily one hand ! 

anyone ever drive ` turbo ' variant ? 
curious ...
