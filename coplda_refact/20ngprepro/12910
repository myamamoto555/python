guess still clear term `` candida bloom '' mean , 
certainly well know thrush superficial 
infection mucous membrane occur antibiotic use . 
nothing systemic yeast syndrome , `` quack '' 
diagnosis discuss . 
> find sinus mucus membrane candida .

lucky ? 
since recent article randomize controlled trial 
oral yogurt reduce vaginal candidiasis , mention 
number patient frequent vaginal yeast infection 
could try eat 6 ounce yogurt daily . 
turn would 
rather use anti-fungal cream get yeast infection . 
> yogurt dangerous . 
standard part medical practice , 
> gordon r. say , incidence gi distress vaginal yeast 
> infection decline . 
, systemic yeast syndrome , 
nothing quack therapy discuss . 
evidence attempt gi tract 
bacterium antibiotic therapy seem helpful 
reduce diarrhea , think anyone would view 
quack therapy .
