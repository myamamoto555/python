might try look available laser locate system . 

work best close work 1 mile . 
rf use much longer distance two major mode . 
transponder 
phase . 
transponder require send pulse another station 
return measure round trip time minus 
receiver time . 
phase measurement require two transmit station send 
frequency signal multiplex time . 
receiver pick 
measure phase shift signal . 
map draw plot 
line position correspond certain phase shift two 
station .
