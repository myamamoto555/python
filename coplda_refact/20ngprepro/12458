real easy get focus 
forget giants happen first place . 

work , screw change thing , think 
ought different . 
folk like argue theoretical detail . 
prefer watch team 
win . 
giants slip third , talk re-arrange 
batting order . 
, think stupid focus wrong , 
simple fact work .

major ? 
follow al , comment `` majors '' . 
nl , 
choice 1b league team , would clark , 
would hit third . 
fantasy team grace murray , 
never able get clark . 
would take three without 
hesitation real life , think clark . 
williams : even close . 
much prefer defense , 
, matt good , solid swing real punch . 
drop 
.230 , wander cleanup , accord latest 
baseball weekly , hit .275 , last week , hit .296 . 
exactly chop liver . 
mostly , though , giants win , frankly , long 
continue , rather silly strategy . 
evidently , 
folk would rather right first .
