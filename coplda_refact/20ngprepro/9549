theory lisp . 
also group projects 2nd 4th year , 
student work team select project decide work 
outside company disadvantage specification would change 
suddenly . 
first four year , 50 % :50 % weighting coursework 
exam subject . 
however honours year , reduce 
30 % % split individual project final exam coursework 
assessment - computer science course like ? 
btw - start 22 student first year leave 8 
honours year . 
also , every course tutor separately . 
easy try
