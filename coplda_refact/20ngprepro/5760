worry ; go cheat something 
get catch . 
key size one thing 
verify externally . 
feed lot random pair 
chip , try flip random key bit , see happen 
output . 
already know happen -- half output 
bit vary , average , 1-bit key change input change . 
build weak cryptosystem , might case 
bit much less powerful , sense 
enter encryption late game . 
contrast , 
des design use key bit early possible ; 50 % output 
change rate appear early round 5 . 
, though , think 
nsa go cheat crudely ; likely get catch . 
consider start bit 23 47 , 
use either bit except xor . 
system 
make early use every bit . 
exhaustive key search would 
2 ^ 79 key search . 
test vary single key bit 
would turn anything interesting . 
remember promise let committee outside expert see 
cryptosystem design . 
assume something , bias 
generation schedule stick like sore thumb . 
algorithm suggest would stick like sore thumb , 
sure could design system subtle key redundancy 
well-hidden , would still make exhaustive key search 
take far less 2 ^ 80 encryption . 
believe claim 
real verify externally .
