hmmm , give interesting idea . 
argument : 
1 second amendment give right keep bear arm . 
2 strong cryptography `` arm '' , accord u.s. government 
hard export . 
therefore , right strong cryptography ! 
q.e.d. 
however , likely hard harder exercise right 
get exercise rights government slowly 
restrict . 
maybe nra _ would _ best exist organization ?
