would really like know . 
btw , sherri , thanks

course run score important run prevent . 
penny save penny earn . 
enough cliche . 
point braves starter able live 
potential , need much offensive support . 
realize big . 
staff leave '92 bosox dust . 
legitimate comparison . 
two cy young winner , three 
pitcher team league would kill first 
second starter . 
seem quality pitcher take 
mound , team score less run . 
team score 
run win . 
put team better pitching advantage 
provide stop oppose team score run . 
low 
score game would clearly benefit braves . 
many 
low score game due excellent pitching average hit . 
flip side , starting lineup great offensive player , 
would argue team would need great pitcher . 
would advantage could simply outscore 
opponent . 
name game win . 
even ray knight know 
put run scoreboard . 
try say assemble quality pitcher 
like braves , offense need strong .
