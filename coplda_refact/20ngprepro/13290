u use law enforcement field phone place 
call , unit whose ` start secure session ' button press first , 
phone transmit law enforcement field ? 
even assume 
one first two choice , fbi go get fresh n , u 
database every phone call , eventually accumulate key 
phone use connect line monitor , 
` suspect ' key . 
assume fbi forget key 
wiretap permission expire . 
quite pyramid , 
bad , either . 
carl worried every day .
