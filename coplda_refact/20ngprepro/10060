question slight variation previously mention 
example perhaps people could give pointer 
couple year since con law class college hope 
miss something obvious ... 
basic scenario : 
set bb use public-key encryption encryption 
file disk . 
general setup design user 
connect send private key encrypt use system public 
key user 's public-private use wrap 
one-time session key use encrypt file disk . 

result even reveal system private key 
impossible anyone gain access file store 
machine . 
possible someone use reveal 
system private key entice user reveal thier personal 
private key authentication sequence . 
question : 
fact system private key provide 
information useful search give protection far 
coerce reveal key ? 
doubt . 
. 
seem provide system private key mean 
assist `` entrapment '' user would send thier key anyway 
entice something would 
otherwise hook use ? 
would user enticement require wiretap approval ? 
answer general musing subject would appreciate ...
