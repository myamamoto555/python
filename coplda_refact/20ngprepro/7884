bet classify . 
unless _ major _ change law , beast 
`` classified patent . '' 
patents exist encourage communication 
develop state art . 
classify patent , `` patent secrecy order '' . 
suppose invent voice scrambler cb radio , apply patent . 
patent office decide nsa might interested , give copy 
application , get nice note back say patent 
application classify national security reason 
longer allow make sell . 
pick example happen late 1970 . 
probably analog scrambler , would probably 
violate fcc rule anyway , get classify . 
suppose publish paper really spiffy algorithm 
file patent application . 
since publish , 
gain anything classify , though get 
patent country us , patent law different . 
obviously system classified patent would highly bogus 
`` sell widget , classified patent . 
allow see patent , know design , 
give money work progress maybe throw 
jail espionage . '' 
country might kind 
system , . 
quite . 
yet .
