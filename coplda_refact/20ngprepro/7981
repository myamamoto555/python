think passage look follow . 
matthew 5:17 `` think come abolish law 
prophet ; come abolish fulfil . 
matthew 5:18 truly , say , till heaven earth pass away , 
iota , dot , pass law accomplish . 
matthew 5:19 whoever relax one least commandment 
teach man , shall call least kingdom heaven ; 
teach shall call great kingdom 
heaven . 
matthew 5:20 tell , unless righteousness exceed 
scribe pharisee , never enter kingdom heaven . 
several problem . 
serious 
law regard jew time binding jews , 
gentile . 
rule bind human 
so-called law , quite minimal . 

issue church face jesus ' death 
gentile want follow christ . 
decision 
impose law say law abolish . 

simply acknowledge fact apply gentiles . 

simple answer , think everyone agree . 
discussion issue less term record 
act 15 . 
however involve . 
order get full picture 
role law , come grip paul 's apparent 
rejection law , relate jesus ' commendation 
law . 
least read paul , say law serve 
purpose certain sense supercede . 
, 
issue one abolition law . 
middle 
discussion , paul note might understand way , 
assure intend say . 
rather , see 
law primarily present convict people 
sinfulness . 
ultimately impossible standard , one 
supercede christ . 
paul 's comment world 's 
clearest , everyone agree reading . 

interesting thing notice even radical position 
entail abolition law . 
still remain 
uncompromising standard , iota dot may remove . 
purpose convict sin , important 
relax . 
however christian , end -- ultimately 
live faith , law . 
theoretical category use rather different , 
end think jesus paul come rather similar conclusion . 

quote passage mat 5 take context rest 
sermon mount , jesus show interpret 
law . 
`` iota dot '' would suggest rather literal reading , 
fact jesus ' approach . 
jesus ' interpretation 
emphasize intent law , stay away ceremonial 
detail . 
indeed well know take rather free attitude 
towards sabbath kosher law . 
scholar claim mat 
5:17 -20 need take context 1st cent . 
jewish 
discussion . 
jesus accuse opponent care give 
tenth even minor herb , neglect thing 
really matter : justice , mercy faith , care cup 
plate clean , fact inside people 
use full extortion rapacity . 
mat -25 , 
discussion later mat 5 , suggest jesus specific 
view law mind , talk maintain 
law full strength , think aspect . 
paul 's conclusion similar . 
talk law 
supercede , specific example give involve 
`` ceremonial law '' , circumcision sabbath . 
quite 
concerned maintain moral standard . 
net result paul talk law 
supercede , jesus talk law maintain , believe 
talk different aspect law . 
paul 
embroil argument circumcision . 
natural letter 
respond specific situation , look aspect 
law currently cause trouble : law specifically jewish 
ceremony . 
certainly intend abolish divine standard 
conduct . 
hand , jesus commend law , seem 
talk law broadest implication moral 
human relationship , deemphasize aspect later 
give paul much trouble . 
unfortunate people use term different way , 
familiar current conflict . 
look 
way term like `` family value '' take special meaning 
current context . 
imagine poor historian future try 
figure `` family value '' use code word 
opposition homosexuality one specific period u.s. 
think law take similar role argument paul 
involve . 
paul clearly reject jewish value 
go along term `` law '' , people concern 
`` family value '' movement really oppose family 
value .
