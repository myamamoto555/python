first , realize tesla invent ac power generator , motor , 
transformer , conductor , etc. . 
technically , transformer tesla 
coil . 
general though someone refer tesla coil , mean 
`` air core resonant transformer '' . 
tv flyback version tesla 
coil see _ _ v3 , 
diagram air core . 
class circuit call 
`` oscillating shuttle circuit '' osc . 
generally osc 's highly 
efficient , version use transistor resistor , 
lossy device . 
typically tesla use active 
reactance instead passive resistor , could achieve 
efficiency 99.5 % , better . 
usual application 
resonant transformer , osc , produce strong emi 
wireless broadcast . 
well think computer 
screen would work remove hf hv tesla flyback coil 
? 
remove home industry 
tesla coil , light would go dark , car would sputter 
die , radio would go silent , industry would grind 
halt , would go back use coal heat , 
gas lamp , horse transportation , steam power , 
telegraph communication . 
real world enough 
get message ! 
would 
today tesla . 
give credit credit due ! 
edison , would still 19th century . 
flame peril . 
good put edison .

et `` tesla 100 year ahead time . 
perhaps time come '' .
