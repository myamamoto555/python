astonishingly sensitive rfi . 
key 2w ht engine 
hood open , car lose timing due rf leak 
distributor pickup . 
poor design . 
, however , point ham radio operator usually quite willing 
help interference detect . 
remember interference 
waste power ; put 1w tv band , 1w put 
band try transmit , 1w often difference 
nice card hang wall , nothing . 
cber , however ,

illegal cber , however , stop operation 
inform problem . 
rest stop operation 
inform local fcc office problem write , give detail 
address .
