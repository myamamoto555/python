many veterinarian feel lyme disease dog easy treat 
endemic area , often give appropriate antibiotic dog 
present lameness , swollen joint , + - fever . 
recent paper march 1993 finally establish lyme disease dog 
reproduce controlled setting . 

matter researcher , one fundamental requirement 
many acknowledge agent particular disease . 
, vaccine manufacturer able `` prove '' 
disease exist . 
paper noteworthy two regard : 
1 none animal infected treat way . 
dog 
episode lameness 6-8 week period occur 2-5 
month exposure . 
period , none show 
clinical sign 17 month observation period study . 

proven , clinically sick lyme patient show spontaneous 
recovery without benefit drug treatment . 
course , observation 
longer 17 month necessary sure disease 
see human . 
2 addendum paper call question technique use 
vaccine manufacturer validate vaccine . 
course , want 
world use model develop order test vaccine 
efficacy . 
anyway , maybe see independent , scientifically sound evaluation
