anybody name player ` rush ' major let 's , 
argument 's sake , define `` rush '' bring major 
cup coffee prior age 22 younger , perform 
expectation , whose career damage rush ? 
serious ; 
tend agree david bring player sooner better , 
would like look player theory work , 
. 
would prefer player within last 10 year , 
look minor league stats . 
important distinguish 
player legitimately career minor league number 
would project , oppose player hype fail , 
actually career line minor league number . 
let 's kick example player `` rush '' , although 
seem damage career . 
jay bell 
give 135 pa major league age 21 , perform well 
would expect aaa number season . 
get 236 pa 
next year age 22 , still underperform . 
however , next year , 
age 24 , performance improve , win everyday shortstop job , 
ever since . 
really hard see 
would better stay minor league 
perform quite well aaa time , rather `` rush '' ; 
cleveland might better , suppose , might 
less likely give . 
yes , bring player early , likely go struggle . 

delay time stop struggle , start 
perform expectation ?
