post lyn bates mailing list : 
recently learn kates go boston give talk 
law school waco situation . 
course , 
set incident start long unhappy 
conclusion . 
, yesterday go hear . 
follow rough 
summary think hear say , take 
exactly actually say ... 
kates start say since know fire 
audience happen day , would 
discuss , would concentrate original raid . 
koresh definitely play full deck . 
? 

first time leader new , small religious group 
ridicule public . 
extreme religious view nearly always fuel 
hatred mistrust . 
first amendment apply , maybe especially , 
people like koresh . 
lengthy digression history police organization us . 
none 1830 , begin metropolitan area . 
police originally arm ; find crime progress , 
call local armed citizen help . 
many begin carry arm 
protection despite regulation , eventually law 
change allow carry gun . 
original intent many 
small police department , jealous one another competitive , 
large enough threat liberty , hence plethora 
organization range postal inspector coast guard . 

fbi start , agent authority oto carry gun 
, , bureau investigation , police force . 
`` police agency misuse anyone power maintain 
power . '' 
batf start tax collection agency , whose primary job raid 
illegal still . 
price sugar go high moonshiner 
longer find trade longer profitable , many illegal still 
disappear , batf need something else justify 
existence , turn activity like phony raid gun store . 
around time batf 's annual budget review , media 
alert batf come place , 
pre-arranged time , bunch car full batf agent roar door 
media get great picture agent enter premise 
gun dealer suspect keep book properly . 
media 
invite boring hour agent leaf paperwork , 
irregularity find , media get cover agent 
remove armful gun premise , luckless ffl 
chain . 
waco incident happen week batf 's budget 
review . 
kates ' opinion stage publicity stunt go bad , 
batf never think moment would actually shoot 
, would plan raid differently send 100 
agent open ground cover , example , would 
medical personnel hand . 
confirm year ago warrant koresh 's arrest 
connection murder charge , local sheriff call 
phone explain . 
koresh sais , ok , come pick , 
sheriff , temporarily confiscate gun could 
test . 
koresh later clear , release , presumably get gun 
back . 
least time , rational enough approach 
rationally , behave reasonable manner . 
batf take account , unlike ffl 's 
audit , koresh actually paranoid , foster paranoia 
follower . 
thus stunt look like real attack , 
react accordingly . 
respect original warrant , unseal kates 
give talk , could comment , except mention 
batf know 
informant , manage get judge issue warrant . 

say way warrant serve , may 
completely illegal . 
apparently proper way serve warrant 
knock door announce officer warrant 
; open door evidence flushable , 
ok break door . 
since hard flush gun 
toilet , may justification batf 
break way . 
constitutional rights 
davidians violate invalid warrant , improperly serve 
warrant , davidians may justify acton . 

close look one original film show one batf agent _ may _ 
shoot accident enter building ; , 
first shot fire ! 
role media could whole lot worse . 
initial 
position side batf , media begin come around 
view might situation legally arm citizen hold 
bad , possibly illegal attack . 
real cynic might say fbi 
go clear public opinion 
begin change side , fbi want act lose 
public 's sympathy . 
batf abolish ? 
. 
police agency _ _ numerous , 
diverse , inefficient , decentralize , etc. . 
better inept accident 
like , move toward single , large , well-organized , 
well-trained , powerful , domestic police force , would eventually 
even tragic result .

ps kates give shorter version talk boston 
college law school next tuesday , april 27 .

place , presumably phone call bc law school could elicit 
information .
