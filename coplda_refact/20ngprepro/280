result cursor 
| get , cursor 
| window get 
| default . 
would like cursor _ _ 
| window application , get . 
think correct behavior . 
remember default 
keyboard mean cmap focus follow 
keyboard focus . 
since dialog modal , mwm allow keyboard 
focus onto main shell , allow cmap focus either . 
since sound though : pointer , 
suggest set : pointer also . 
way , cmap 
focus slavishly follow keyboard focus , beat path . 
: explicit , set cmap focus 
explicit also , need binding _ color , probably 
.
