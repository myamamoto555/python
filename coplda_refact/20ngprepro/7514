way multi-tasking computer actually give 
cpu power , overlap . 
overlap , cpu continue `` think '' disk 
operation underway , whereas without overlap , cpu sit idly 
wait disk operation finish - disk operation take 
eternity , compare fast cpu . 
, get multi-tasking , want increase performance 
increase amount overlap . 
one way dma bus mastering . 
either make 
possible device move datum memory 
without interrupt cpu . 
alternative cpu move 
datum . 
several scsi interface card allow dma 
bus mastering . 
ide , however , define standard interface 
create ibm pc , require cpu move datum 
byte , dma .
