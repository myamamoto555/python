sound almost like

cost ,

sure , possible

ever go - shelf technology someone 
? 
maybe part ssf design goal . 
; - 
gee fred . 
bitter defense 20 khz power basic technology 
ssf , id think would support minor research program like . 
anyone know particle physics , know ipn 
could prove technology ?

may also help political gridlock entire 
nuclear technical agenda . 
big political 
fast breeder technologies . 
wipp fight death court . 
even could make nuclear incinerator , really think 
even deaf smith county nevada would accept ? 
rule 
nuclear power concern . 
medical community 
able overrule nuclear technology opposition .
