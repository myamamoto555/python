interesting question would atom 
> object classical phenomenon ? 
follow train talk , question dismiss atom 
sense `` real '' leave uneasy . 
seem imply effect , therefore 
underlie thing necessarily real . 
tree outside window 
category ... observe light bounce , tree 
. 
observation indirect , observation 
make atom . 
also , observation experiment routinely 
individual atom . 
think particular atom trapping 
experiment test fundamental quantum mechanic quantum zeno 
effect , individual atom study long period time . 
attempt quantum mechanical argument satisfying 
either . 
one make argument without solid 
technical background field . 
read seem little confuse 
quite red herring . 
anyway , purpose public debate make audience think , 
work . 
, willing try defend follow assertion 
anyone care : 
atom real tree , real every-day sense 
word `` real '' .
