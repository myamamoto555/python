ok , ask , new thread line , 
ask : 
1 : large hole current run thru resistor , 
^ 2 r cooling instead heating ? 
2 : anyone design amplifier preferentially amplify 
hole current normal electron current ? 
3 : semiconductor material highest ratio 
hole mobility electron mobility ? 
please quote actual 
test sample rather estimate base theory . 
also , 
limit semiconductor : consider also insulator , 
resistor , dielectric , , conductor , 
magnet metal , ceramic , magnetostrictive , etc . 
note : 
summarize , thread far state area 
hole detectable vacuum . 
, hole 
particle exist presence matter . 
previous thread state hole exist certain 
semi-conductor . 
question naturally arise 
hole current inside semi-conductor vanish point 
semiconductor join conductor say , copper . 
want theoretical discussion whether 
hole could exist inside metal conductor , rather ask 
experimental discussion amplify detect 
current exist . 
also note 
since become electronic discussion .
