.413 obp . 
hit 0 zip , nil , nada walk . 
reason lot galarraga long history 
show nowhere near real level ability except 
draw walk . 
hit .400 , say , even 250 ab 's would convince 
real change ability . 
obp < avg , would 
amaze would make bet would unique feat 
history game . 
45 ab 's prove ?

player avg ab 
blauser .367 49 
grace .391 48 
milligan .400 35 
conine .375 40 
lansing .400 50 
slaught .406 32 
guy really good ? 
well , word , . 
significant 
galarraga 's average ? 
45 ab level , hit worth . 

would one hit call error one take away good 
defensive play , would .380 range .

walk , bet rent money .
