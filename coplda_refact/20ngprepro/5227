dear friend , 
risc mean `` reduce instruction set computer '' . 
risc usually 
small instruction set reduce circuit complex increase 
clock rate high performance . 
read book 
computer architecture information risc .

hope clear : 
take one lecture note 
'' ... alternative approach cisc , 
adopt many 
recent year , come know `` risc '' : reduce 
instruction set computer . 
characterise simply 
`` simpler faster '' ; simplify design e.g. reduce 
variety instruction & address mode , hardware 
design run faster . 
even cost need 
instruction , task quickly simpler , 
faster design . 
typical risc processor : 
o provide large number register e.g. 32 ; 
o perform datum operation register ; 
o provide address mode e.g. immediate ` register + offset ' ; 
o allow load & store operation access memory ; 
o use instruction format ; 
o support datum type e.g. integer , unsigned , float .
