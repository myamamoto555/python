number civilian iraqi death way 
exploit anti-war emotionalism liberal news media . 

fact less iraqis die gulf war civilian 
war comparable size century !

`` size '' war define ? 

> number participant ? 
geographical area ? 
number country involve ? 
> number casualty ? 
size army , duration , number casualty absolute 
percentage involve , geographical area number country 
, measure size . 
case would say relevant 
statistic would number combatant total troops compare 
total casualty among total civilian population 
affect geographical area .

vietnam korea might make good comparison .

western news general , particular american `` mass media '' : 
cbs , nbc , abc , etc. . 
general tone news whole 
war one `` poor , poor iraqis '' along `` look precisely 
cruise missile blow building bit '' . 
due mostly 
short duration couple precise surgical bombing technique 
technically possible recently .

bomber harris hero mine . 
perhaps . 
maybe atomic bomb mistake . 
easy 
say `` enlighten '' viewpoint 90 's , right ? 
back 
, all-out war , germany japan squashed . 
, million british already die , hundred 
thousand french , couple thousand americans , 
million russians , mention million jews , poles , 
people slavic descent german concentration camp . 

thing consider , atomic bomb 
essential therefore justified bring war quick 
end avoid even greater ally loss . 
, one , regret . 
> 
war never exact science , 
smart bomb , become exact smaller percentage 
civilian casualty . 
sometimes mistake make ; target 
misidentify ; innocent die . 
war way really .

> regard life people , way war really . 
sure . 
people suffer . 

reason depose `` entrenched political ruler operate 
selfish interest '' ! 
mean apply ally 
well ?? 
> 
> fuss kuwait east timor , bosnia , even tibet ? 

> iraq bad , still sell stuff couple week 
> start bombing ? 
make claim effort justify misguided foreign policy 
west war . 
evident west , especially america , 
misjudge hussein drastically . 
hussein invade kuwait 
threaten militarily corner significant portion world 's 
oil supply , stop . 
sure war could 
prevent judicious concerted effort part west 
hussein invade kuwait , still hussein 
responsible decision invade . 
, 
strong response west require .

mathew , sarcasm note completely off-base . 
come sound like complete idiot , although 
feel sure intent .

sound like loving christian ? 
well , 
> good job . 
well , `` loving '' allow hussein hitler gobble 
nearby country keep . 
allow continue mass 
slaughter certain people dominion . 
, would 
say yes , stop hussein `` loving '' thing 
people involve set mind military conquest . 
> 
iraqi war wrong , eh ? 
sure appeasement would 
work better war , like ww2 , eh ? 
> 
> even mention appeasement ? 
make think situation 
> even remotely analogous world war two ? 
mention . 
intervene , allow hussein keep kuwait , would 
appeasement . 
precisely lesson world learn 
ww2 motivate western alliance war . 
let hitler take 
austria stop ww2 happen , let 
hussein keep kuwait would stop eventual gulf war 
protect saudi arabia . 
> 
guess 
fight ww2 either -- think innocent 
german civilian kill dresden hamburg . 
> 
> yes , . 
german human , know . 
> 
sure . 
truly unfortunate follow hitler 
grandiose quest `` thousand year reich '' . 
consequence 
stem . 
tyrant like hussein stop . 
kind understand 
diplomacy ; understand point gun . 
regret 
bush wimp military roll baghdad , 
hussein still power iraqi people 's sacrifice 
mention 357 americans die naught .

`` hard imagine '' ? 
argument incredulity 
gain acceptance revered author `` construct logical

expect another revision soon ?? 
kidding .

neither prosecution

explanation ? 
mass

tell .

ok . 
certainly seem excessive force involve . 
frankly , original `` guilty '' verdict baffle . 

learn prosecution first case try convict 
charge excessive force simple assault probably 
would win , try get conviction charge aggravate 
assault intent inflict serious bodily harm . 
charge , 
news commentator say , akin attempt murder california 
law . 
base prosecution ask , evident 
first jury decide officer `` guilty '' . 
note , 
`` guilty '' wrong , `` guilty '' aggravate assault 
intent inflict serious bodily harm . 
seed 
prosecution defeat overconfidence obtain 
verdict go extreme charge could . 
fact news commentator present true , 
feel `` guilty '' verdict reasonable one .
