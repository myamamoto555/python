wonder hard would i.e. would add cost 
design desktop machine power saver feature build would 
reduce power consumption automatically machine idle 
amount time . 
pretty standard portable machine , 
kind trick could play ; spin disk , turn 
screen , reduce clock speed , etc. . 
advantage turn 
thing would 1 remember anything 2 
machine still available network . 
tricky part might define constitute inactivity . 
certainly , want wake sleep mode somebody 
ping , want wake least cpu somebody 
log via telnet connection . 
would worry much waste electricity winter 
month ; energy get turn heat . 
may 
efficient way heat building central heating plant , 
bad . 
summer though , disaster . 

waste power , probably also run air conditioning 
get rid waste heat .
