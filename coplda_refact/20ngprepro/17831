respect clinton 's presidency `` depend ... act 
effectively serbian aggression ? 
... first 
nothing genocide would betrayal value 
ally profess . '' 
times , merely 
betrayal value . 
serb attack 
proxy , hitler .

different form , war balkans destablize 
europe . 
hear , bosnians europe 's palestinians ; 
say , palestinian refugee problem 
key instability middle east ,

atlantic ocean divide , americas ultimately tie 
destiny europe . 
europe destabilize , u.s. 
inevitably affect draw problem . 

whirlpool , sooner later draw maelstrom .
