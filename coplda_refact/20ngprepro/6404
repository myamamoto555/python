jesus bear jew . 
biblical account 
mother 's ancestry father 's , trace back 
david . 
seem reasonable assume , therefore , jesus 
semitic . 
interesting aside , jesus ' semitic make 
neither `` white '' `` black , '' sense underscore 
point make earlier color important , 
message , grace , divinity concentrate 
. 
finally , would direct anyone interested african 
involvement church account conversion 
ethiopian eunuch act chapter 9 think chapter 
9 . 
one earliest conversion , eunuch , 
treasurer queen ethiopians , definitely 
african . 
`` ethiopia '' time indicate region 
south egypt , many also speculate man 
first african christian , first black christian 
well . 
god bless ,
