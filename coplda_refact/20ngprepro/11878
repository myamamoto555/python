would like field one , may . 
although believer follower 
christ , experience religion positive . 

fact , one point life , three day , simply 
_ could _ believe existence god . 
anyway , look back upon 
trouble , seem fall two category -- impulse 
unbelief result logical contradiction , impulse unbelief 
result frustration god . 
first category occur much anymore , work 
argument non-existence god . 
way back , 
would cause problem , would struggle faith 
continue believe . 
see less stubborn 
mean stubborn . 
stubborness often thing standing 
atheism time time would fail . 
second category arise long-term personal difficulty 
struggle live life god would live without live 
life would tell god would live . 
good example 
struggle radical christian meet . 
, 
ever , `` fire , '' think ever want . 
nevertheless , `` lukewarm '' faith , really 
fit mainstream either . 
quite naturally , feel lot anxiety 
dislocation within christian society , lead lot 
internal tension , want _ know _ right , 
another part believe want wrong 
christian think . 
quite naturally , tension 
destructive effect relationship god , internal 
strife , atheism sit like promised land -- rule , 
responsibility , need live anyone 's expectation . 
complete freedom . 
course , illusion , nevertheless , 
appealing illusion , especially so-called `` people god '' 
behave like total twit . 
easily understand someone would go 
route , would hostile ever come back . 
, many - 
experience christ god 
peaceful one , one mind-control `` - 
- 's - 's - god 's - - 
- 's - '' courtesy christ 's 
overzealous follower . 
final reason people become atheist christian 
good reputation right . 
one thing attract people 
christianity ancient day love christian obviously 
one another world around . 
unlike rest world , 
christian community actively care poor , christian rich 
tread back poorer brother , bent help 
. 
christian know live exemplary life , even 
think traitor state would sacrifice 
. 
nowadays , courtesy media christian leader lose 
christ way power , people see christian 
want remake society facist version 
moral view . 
lot reason people become atheist , time 
go right .
