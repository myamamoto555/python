trouble many post recently try support 
doctrine original sin . 
primarily catholic doctrine , 
purpose defend idea infant baptism . 
even among , 
supporter , however , people stop short say unbaptised infant 
go hell . 
easy anyone come partial list 
scripture support sort wrong doctrine . 
however , 
heart persevere belief make sure biblically 
base , come understanding truth . 
let 's take 
complete look scripture . 
colossians 2:11 -12 `` also circumcise , put 
sinful nature , circumcision christ , 
bury baptism raise faith 
power god , raise dead . '' 
baptism , raise new life christ romans 6:4 
personal faith power god . 
parent 's faith . 

infant faith ? 
let 's look bible say . 
romans 10:16 -17 `` israelites accept good news . 

isaiah say , ` lord , believe message ? ' 
consequently , faith 
come hear message , message hear word 
christ . '' 
receive god 's gift faith hear message 
gospel . 
faith possible response hear god 's word preach . 
kid 
yet spiritually , intellectually , emotionally mature enough 
respond god 's word . 
hence faith therefore 
raise baptism new life . 
ezekiel 18:20 `` soul sin die . 
son share 
guilt father , father share guilt son . 

righteousness righteous man credit , 
wickedness wicked charge . '' 
read ezekiel 18 , see god hold guilty 
anyone else 's sin . 
original guilt adam . 
ezekiel 18:31 -32 `` rid , 
get new heart new spirit . 
die , o house israel ? 
take pleasure death anyone , declare sovereign lord . 
repent live ! '' 
way please god repent get new heart spirit . 
kid 
. 
act 2:38 -39 say repent baptize , 
receive new spirit , holy spirit . 
shall live . 
little background original sin 
biblical , let 's look scripture use support . 
romans 5:12 `` therefore , sin enter world one man , 
death sin , way death come man , 
sin -- '' 
sin death enter world first man sin . 
death come 
man man sin . 
note good read 
romans 5:12 -21 . 
verse easier misunderstand 
, read context see 
say basically thing . 
let 's look one . 
romans 5:19 `` disobedience one man many 
make sinner , also obedience one man many 
make righteous . '' 
disobedience individual , make sinner . 

way , obedience jesus , make righteous . 
must remember read passage death come 
man man sin , guilt adam . 
otherwise bible would contradict . 
encourage read 
whole passage , look point 
view see fit together . 
psalm `` surely sinful birth , sinful time mother 
conceive . '' 
whole psalm wonderful example humble 
god repentance sinning . 
david man god 's 
heart write psalm commit bathsheba 
murder husband . 
david say 
remember time sinful . 
humbling god 
confess sinfulness . 
say sinful birth 
hyperbole . 
bible , inspire god , limit literal 
, also use figure speech jesus john 16:25 . 
another example hyperbole , see luke 14:26 . 
, even though people see baptism require faith 
original sin biblical , still argue infant baptism 
necessary child sin selfish - share toy 
child , mean - hit fight , etc. . 
certainly observe child wrong thing , gut feeling 
always know better . 
let 's look see bible 
agree gut feeling . 
isaiah 7:14 -15 `` therefore lord give sign : 
virgin child give birth son , call 
immanuel . 
eat curd honey know enough reject 
wrong choose right . '' 
church leader tell prophecy 
jesus . 
, point matthew 1:23 find new 
leader . 
jesus certainly could less knowledge normal human 
baby . 
yet passage say mature certain extent 
would know difference right wrong . 
see 
grow become wiser luke 2:40 2:52 . 
implication 
jesus wrong thing child know choose right 
wrong . 
since know jesus perfect -- without sin , rather 
conclusive proof baby sin know choose 
right instead wrong . 
jesus baptize , albeit john 's baptism , infant , 
thirty-year-old man luke 3:21 -23 start ministry 
soon baptize luke 3:23 . 
immediately afterwards , 
tempt devil luke 4:1 -13 ; matthew 4:1 -11 ; mark 1:12 -13 . 
thank attention . 
moderator - finish subject . 
perhaps 
would like make faq response repost 
time time topic come . 
feel free rearrange 
contents would like , please send copy final faq . 
sincerely , 
aaron cardenas 

think overly optimistic authoritative quality 
response . 
first , original sin doctrine . 
hold luther calvin well , still present one 
form another lutheran reformed tradition . 
second , 
say purpose defend infant baptism 
ad hominem argument , considerable evidence . 
original baptist theology include original sin , baptist 
still hold . 
certainly group baptize infant 
without believe original sin . 
among protestants , sacrament 
tend bit symbolic among catholics . 
protestants 
baptize infant see baptism sign god 's acceptance , 
rather acceptance god . 
traditional protestant 
theology , god 's grace precede response , applicable 
child . 
number passage one cite indicate 
god accept even child .
