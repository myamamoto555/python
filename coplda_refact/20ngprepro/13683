far `` toss , '' gospel take , almost 
universally , primary source information jesus . 
curious mike cobb refer . 
`` toss '' 
new testament ? 
undoubtedly naive atheist , 
phrasing question seem suggest cobb 
ascribe broadly . 
perhaps question get heart matter 
, except naive believer , unfortunately , far 
outnumber nonbeliever , naive critical , gospel 
take `` gospel truth '' faithfully record 
happen two thousand year ago ? 
easy answer , 
answer nothing miracle : text take 
way critical reader . 
myth among naive believer one take text , 
measure set criterion , either confirm 
text `` historically valid '' `` toss '' text . 
suspect 
myth come way history present primary 
secondary school , certain text vest authority , 
writer josh mcdowell pretend present 
historical argument along line religious 
program . 
fact , text use primary secondary 
school history class ought toss , even better 
text treat authoritatively 
, josh mcdowell would know historical argument 
bite keister twice . 
let present barest outline different view text 
use study history . 
first , text 
historically valid . 
text . 
put another way , 
never see notion `` historical validity '' make 
sense apply text . 
second , text read 
tell `` gospel truth '' historical event , way 
many student wont read history text primary 
secondary school . 
text . 
include favorite 
author 's history whatever . 
every text historical fact . 
every text write 
person group people purpose . 
hence , every 
text serve historical evidence . 
question : 
learn text ? 
interesting thing 
text provide evidence ? 
diary follower maharishi , formerly 
oregon , historical evidence . 
gospel historical 
evidence . 
letter officer participate 
vampire inquest eastern europe historical evidence . 

modern american history textbook whitewash `` great american 
figure '' historical evidence . 
historical 
evidence various thing . 
much evidence 
maharishi , formerly oregon , could levitate ; 
jesus resurrect ; vampire exist ; `` great 
american figure '' squeaky clean learn school . 
better evidence people `` see '' maharishi , 
late oregon , levitate ; early christian 
think jesus resurrect ; many people eastern europe 
`` saw '' vampire return grave ; still 
educational system largely prefer spread myth rather 
teach history . 
one draw causal connection infer piece 
historical evidence -- text otherwise -- evince ? 

complex question easily summarize answer . 
many book subject various part 
subject . 
enjoy david hackett fischer 's `` historian 's fallacies '' 
good antidote uncritical way easy 
read text present history . 
relatively cheap . 
easy 
read . 
give try .
