64k ram preferably flash ram . 
look around , see lot 
people engineer subsystem ready 
interface custom device . 
much , 
would best avoid reinvent system . 
need use 
188 cpu , able load program host 
transfer control program . 
well , one thing rom 
need know . 
routine send receive byte 
host , utilize hardware control line dtr , rts , dts , cts . 
everything see $ 200.00 range . 
much 
application . 
need something around $ 100.00 . 
cpu uart 
built-in , look chip . 
anyone know 
company market good board range , public domain
