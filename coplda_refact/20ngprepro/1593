someone cite biblical reference homosexuality immoral , 
leviticus ? 
far , ask , around , get verse 
leviticus spout , whole rest book tend 
ignore christian see stoning _ long _ time . 
later , 
max bob muir 
list post long ago , recall , aside lev , commonly 
cite passage : 
story sodom . 
note however homosexual rape , 
disagreement wrong . 
take intermediate 
position : note sodom refer elsewhere 
bible sinfulness . 
seem know 
specifically homosexuality . 
rather , think consider 
cesspool sin . 
however know jewish attitude , 
homosexuality would contribute horror action 
describe . 
almost seem contrived combine 
many form evil one act possible : homosexual rape 
guest , actually angel . 
story specifically 
homosexuality . 
nt , clear reference paul 's letter . 
rom 
1 , passage presuppose homosexuality evil . 
note passage homosexuality -- 
idolatry . 
homosexuality visit people punishment , 
least result , idolatry . 
number argument 
passage . 
use word `` homosexuality '' , refer 
people nature heterosexual practice homosexuality . 
would call explicit teaching homosexuality . 
seem support would natural assumption anyway , 
paul share general negative jewish attitude towards 
homosexuality . 
passage occur list sin , cor 6:9 , tim 
1:10 . 
unfortunately entirely clear word use 
mean . 
suggestion one broader meaning , 
`` wanton '' , another may specifically `` male 
prostitute '' . 
, precise teaching 
homosexuality , least weak supportive evidence paul 
share ot 's negative judgement homosexuality . 
jude 1:7 sometimes cite , however probably relevant . 

context jude involve angel . 
since almost rape 
sodom angel , seem likely `` strange flesh '' refer 
intercourse angel . 
see , nt evidence people 's conclusion 
determine approach bible . 
conservative note 
passage paul 's letter imply accept ot 
prohibition . 
enough regard nt 
endorsement . 
liberal note specific teaching , 
clear definition prohibit concern 
rom 1 connection homosexuality pagan worship ? 
exactly 
word list sin mean ? 
. 
thus believe 
legitimate regard attitude paul take 
background specific teaching gospel . 
explosive topic , tend result long 
dissertation exact meaning various greek word . 

clear mostly irrelevant . 
really come 
whether people look bible law whether 
believe approach inconsistent gospel . 

appear depend upon one 's reaction message bible 
whole , well one 's perception need church today . 
difference approach least serious difference 
protestant catholic 16th cent , one 
side believe bible obviously side 
keep think quote passage 
side finally come sens . 
make thing 
frustrating moderator , realize optimistic 
outcome likely ...
