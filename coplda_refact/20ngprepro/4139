well , want code work old system . 
know sy 7.1 , 
least , bug sound manager cause 
channel hang error message . 
happend keep 
channel open long period - necessary performance - play many 
sound , stop sound halfway . 
callbacks seem reliable . 
way safely tell sound stop play 
inspect private variable channel , think , 
way find tell channel hang inspect 
undocumented flag modify . 
happy ? 
nope . 
consider write simply get 
rid bug . 
better suggestion ? 
silent game among | e solution .
