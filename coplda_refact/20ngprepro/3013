play centris 610 almost week . 
must say 
machine really fast ! 
hardware turn-on feature annoying , 
get circuits work like charm . 
however , still complaint : 
- restart machine every time , screen image desktop 
pattern jerk time . 
- quantum 170 drive noisy 
overall , highly recommend : fast , affordable look great !
