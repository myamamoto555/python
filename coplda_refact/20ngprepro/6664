primary objection beyond one base ideal 
simply something government 
make gun tool rich connected . 
discriminate poor . 
self-defense consider appropriate , , 
condition ? 
allow , instance get gun protection 
go carry large sum money regular 
basis threaten .

contain sort `` gotcha '' clause allow arbitrary denial , even 
qualify every way .

point , point general 
driver 's licence u.s. part nothing like 
european counterpart . 
understand get one far difficult 
. 
u.s. joke . 
usual objection discuss two different 
thing . 
instance , u.s. driver 's license permit 
operate motor vehicle public road . 
necessary 
one , operate private property . 
, 
ability require driving permit generally consider arise 
government 's legitimate power enact reasonable regulation 
behavior public land . 
permit automobile , instance , 
far closer analogy , would much harder thing get 
past legally , since would base make regulation public 
property , restricting activity private property .

vary widely . 
one thing think europeans 
difficult time u.s. fifty unique jurisdiction , 
law one state another radically different 
one country europe another . 
place allow open carry gun knife .

either state local .

question must ask : right individual 
affect rights individual . 
usually 
get rights group mean individual within 
group , define `` people gun , '' adversely affect 
rights group . 
instance , `` bob '' use gun attack `` steve , '' would 
point . 
essentially discuss becuase 
person qualify member group `` people 
gun '' third person , perhaps another time zone tell 
member group take away somebody else 's 
rights . 
like try punish newspaper libel commit 
one .

course .

people might get twist little mind hurt . 
currently option . 
expect . 
> think wise sell gun like candy state ... ?? 
state . 
case , limit state 
may enforce `` wisdom '' . 
freedom general unwise 
concept . 
pre-emptively restrict everything might 
`` unwise '' freedom become meaningless concept . 
> believe think 
> free buy gun ?? 
'll raise hand driver 's . 
currently 
implement waste time little 
generation state ignore startling number 
driver . 
guarantee level skill higher 
necessary get car road get somebody 
else kill , knowledge traffic law beyond ten year 
old pick ride around parent car . 
, mention , two different thing .
