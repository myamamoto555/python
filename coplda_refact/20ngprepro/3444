far see , one big difference davidians 
christian follow . 
sometimes try put 
foot one jesus 's disciple . 
basically , give 
lot -- career , possibly family , well , whole bunch , follow 
jesus . 
difference ? 
quite plain . 
jesus good 
david koresh . 
problem , think , try legislate good 
bad term principle . 
instance , thousand 
law u.s. govern legal . 
often , hard 
bring people justice , possible find 
legal way . 
could trust judge , 
could tell administer justice fairly , justice 
would follow . 
since judge always get right , 
complicated system involve precedent bunch 
stuff attempt make imperfect justice 
man something perfect . 
hear justice 
system u.s. tell quite opposite true . 
also problem tend judge presentation 
material present . 
might consider 
ranting christian bad , eloquent person another 
religion good . 
go along american desire 
protect constitution cost , even allow 
people bad thing . 
think message important . 
man 
present false message , even ever ever mild mannered , 
man perform tremendous disservice . 
know rambling . 
guess try 
say look principle tell 
davidians get wrong . 
wrong follow 
worship person . 
important choose right person . 
simple . 
choose jesus , get right . 
choose 
anyone else , get wrong . 
? 
jesus 
begotten son god , nobody else . 
jesus without sin , 
nobody else .
