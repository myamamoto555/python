ok , discussion observe playback speed quicktime , 
effect scaling , think would test . 
first , feel original speed test perhaps less 
realistic . 
movie use 18 frame 
version first movie create compact video compressor . 
decide something little longer would give closer real-world result 
better worse . 
pull copy `` 2001 : space odyssey '' record tv 
back . 
fifteen minute movie , sequence 
earth shuttle approach space station . 
specifically , digitize 
portion 30 seconds ' duration , zoom rotate space 
station . 
figure would give reasonable amount movement 
frame . 
increase difference frame , digitize 
5 frame per second , give total 171 frame . 
capture raw footage resolution 384 288 pixel spigot 
card centris 650 resolution pal source . 

import premiere put compact video compressor , 
keep 5 fp frame rate . 
create two version movie : one scale 
320 240 resolution , 160 120 resolution . 
use default 
`` 2.00 '' quality setting premiere , specify key frame every ten 
frame . 
run 320 240 movie `` raw speed test '' program use 
result would report earlier . 
result : playback rate 45 frame per second . 
right , get much higher result first short 
test movie . 
fun , copy 320 240 movie external hard 
disk quantum , run . 
time playback rate 
35 frame per second . 
obviously internal hard disk 
also quantum significant contributor speed playback . 
modify speed test program allow specification optional 
scale factor , try play back 160 120 movie scale 320 240 
size . 
time playback speed 60 fp . 
clearly , poster 
observe poor performance scale playback see quicktime 1.0 
action , 1.5 . 
would try test quicktime 1.0 , think 
entirely compatible centris system 7.1 ... 
, playback rate 160 120 movie 100 fp . 
thing try save version 320 240 movie 
`` prefer '' playback rate greater 1.0 , see well play 
within ie quicktime 's normal synchronize playback . 
preferred rate 9.0 > 45 fp work well : playback 
jerky . 
compare raw speed test , achieve 45 fp 
ease . 
believe quicktime 's synchronization code would add 
much overhead : think slowdown come mac system 's task 
switching . 
preferred rate 7.0 > 35 fp seem work fine : could see 
evidence stutter . 
8.0 > 40 fp think could see slight 
stutter , four key frame every second , hard tell . 
guess could try recreate movie longer interval 
key frame , make stutter noticeable . 
course , also 
improve compression slightly , speed playback performance 
even ...
