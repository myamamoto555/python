actually , hiten originally intend go lunar orbit , 
indeed much fuel hand . 
mission 
afterthought , tiny deploy hiten 
lunar flyby transmitter failure proper insertion 
lunar orbit could positively confirm . 
note technique disadvantage . 
take 
long time , end relatively inconvenient lunar orbit . 
want something useful like low circular polar orbit , 
plan expend certain amount fuel , although reduce 
would need brute-force approach .
