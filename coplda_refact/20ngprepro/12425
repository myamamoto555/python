please research carefully . 
fax modem behave like 
printer `` local '' machine , guarantee functionality 
`` local '' machine fax software printing `` remotely 
install '' fax card . 
try workgroup 
fax software like . 
could winfax 's 
think . 
lot special hardware 
interaction take place internally . 
case , fax manager 
program merely `` intercept '' print job spool 
directory , print manager 's spool directory . 

software , appear job `` print '' . 
print manager 
play part handling actual process . 
pardon incorrectly assume 
. 
truely likely 
require , lot weird setup tinkering . 
good luck .
