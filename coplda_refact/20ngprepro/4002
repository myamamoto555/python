get home brew receiver work , would 
willing share rest ? 
always want 
build never time fool around design . 
pin 1 : signal ground

pin 3 : always hot +6 volt 
pin 4 : +6 volt , hot preamp turn 
pin 5 : repeater connector 
infrared repeater jack back preamp connect 
anything inside preamp except 5 pin connector pin # 5 . 

150 ohm resistor two jack , 1.5 k pin 5 
ground . 
signal pin # 2 preamp sum build ir receiver . 
use chip call bjt amplify signal . 
would 
imagine logical way would duplicate circuit use 
external receiver .
