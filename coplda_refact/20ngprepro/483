mileage may vary . 
yes fully agree , `` believe god exist '' , 
`` believe god exist '' ? 
mats 
point , hinge take word `` believe '' mean . 
unfortunately bind definition strong weak 
atheism , least accord faq : 
# atheism characterize absence belief existence god . 
# atheist go , believe god exist . 
former 
# often refer `` weak atheist '' position , latter `` strong 
# atheism '' . 
# 
# important note difference two position . 
`` weak 
# atheism '' simple scepticism ; disbelief existence god . 
`` strong 
# atheism '' positive belief god exist . 
please 
# fall trap assume atheist `` strong atheist '' . 
mathew 's `` introduction atheism '' version 1.2 last modify 
faq clarify try pin notion `` belief '' ?
