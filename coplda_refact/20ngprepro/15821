common misconception , share many manufacturer , programmer , 
user alike . 
, example , simply third equipped comm 
port , necessarily one address . 
bio 
search sequentially set potential comm port address . 

first equip port find become , etc. . 
play 
rule , unless equip . 
set 
`` standard '' whatever mean port address merely reflect 
order bio search address space search 
serial port . 
, indeed non-standard address . 

address 4th table slot instead , program query bio 
determine number install comm port would find , 
field bios datum area contain number would indicate 
3 comm port install . 
frankly , know 
program would actually problem .
