panel service connection inspect 
power utility provide connection . 
sometimes local power authority 
rather usual inspector . 
- install box wiring , 
go , need 
`` '' inspection . 
- wall , wiring complete , 
need `` final inspection '' . 
subject : house meet rule regulation . 
upgrade ?

accord terminology cec nec , 
`` grounding '' conductor safety ground , i.e. , green 
bare wire . 
word `` neutral '' reserve white

however , 
potential confusion `` ground conductor '' `` ground 
conductor '' lead potentially lethal mistake - 
never use bare wire `` ground conductor '' white wire 
`` grounding conductor '' , even though connect 
together panel . 
- feed neutral ground 
separately main panel . 
usually . 
trade , common usage , word `` neutral '' use 
`` ground conductor '' . 
faq use `` neutral '' simply

subject : fuse breaker ? 
difference ? 
fuse circuit breaker design interrupt power 
circuit current flow exceed safe level . 

example , toaster shorts , fuse breaker 
`` trip '' , protect wiring wall melting . 

, fuse breaker primarily intend protect 
wiring -- ul csa approval supposedly indicate 
equipment cause fire . 
fuse contain narrow strip metal design melt 
safely current exceed rate value , thereby 
interrupt power circuit . 
fuse trip relatively 
fast . 
sometimes problem motor 
large startup current surge . 
motor circuit , use 
`` time-delay '' fuse one brand `` '' avoid 
trip momentary overload . 
look like 
spring-loaded fuse . 
fuse trip , must 
replace . 
breakers fairly complicated mechanical device . 

usually consist one spring loaded contact latch 
position another contact . 
current flow 
device exceed rate value , bimetallic strip 
heat bend . 
bend `` trip '' latch , 
spring pull contact apart . 
circuit breaker behave 
similarly - , tend take longer 
trip moderate overload ordinary fuse . 
high 
overload , trip quickly . 
breakers reset finite 
number time - time trip , throw 
circuit use , arc take place , 
damages contact . 
thus , breaker use 
place switch unless specially list 
purpose . 
neither fuse breaker `` limit '' current per se . 
dead 
short circuit cause hundred sometimes even 
thousand ampere flow short period time , 
often cause severe damage . 
subject : breakers ? 
use fuse ? 
statistics show fuse panel significantly higher 
risk cause fire breaker panel . 
usually 
due fuse loosely screw , contact 
corrode heat time , wrong size fuse 
install , proverbial `` replace fuse 
penny '' trick . 
since breaker permanently install , better 
connection mechanism , risk fire considerably less . 
fuse prone explode extremely high overload . 

fuse explode , metallic vapor cloud become conduct 
path . 
result ? 
complete meltdown electrical panel , 
melted service wiring , fire electrical 
distribution transformer house burn . 
breakers . 
many jurisdiction , particularly canada , longer permit 
fuse panel new installation . 
nec permit new

subject : size wire use ? 
20 amp circuit , use 12 gauge wire . 
15 amp circuit , 
use 14 gauge wire locale . 
long run , 
though , use next larger size wire , avoid 
voltage drop . 
12 gauge slightly expensive 
14 gauge , though stiffer harder work .

subject : `` 14-2 '' mean ? 
use describe size quantity conductor 
cable . 
first number specify gauge . 
second 
number current carry conductor wire - 
remember usually extra ground wire . 
`` 14-2 '' mean 
14 gauge , two insulate current carry wire , plus bare ground . 
-2 wire usually black , white bare ground wire . 
sometimes 
white red instead circuit without neutral . 

latter case , sheath usually red . 
-3 wire usually black , red , white bare ground wire . 
usually carry neutral .

gimble wire together pair pliers 
finger . 
use pair blunt nose `` linesman '' pliers , 
carefully twist wire tightly neatly . 
sometimes 
good idea trim result end make sure

people wrap `` open '' end electrical 
tape . 
probably good idea - inspector may 
tear inspection .

bathroom exterior outlet must gfci . 
even require protection , may 
want consider install anyway . 
unless need 
breaker see , cost low . 
u.s. , gfci 
outlet cost little us$ 8 . 
cost bit higher 
canada : c$ 12 . 
evaluate risk factor . 

finish basement ever get wet ? 
small child ? 
use garage outlet power outdoor tool ? 

water melted snow ever puddle inside garage ? 
subject : use ? 
gfci generally use circuit pose 
safety risk , b use power equipment must run 
unattended long period time . 
refrigerator , freezer , 
sump pump good example . 
rationale gfci 
sometimes prone nuisance trip . 
people claim 
inductive delay motor winding cause momentary 
current imbalance , trip . 
note , though , 
gfci trip real ; get lot trip 
apparent reason , would check wiring 
decide gfci break useless . 
subject : difference outlet breaker ? 
situation , use either outlet 
first device circuit , install breaker 
built-in . 
former generally prefer , since 
breaker quite expensive . 
example , ordinary ge 
breaker cost ~ us$ 5 ; gfci model cost ~ us$ 35 . 
one 
major exception : need protect `` branch 
circuit '' two circuit share common neutral wire , 
kitchen circuit , 'll need 
breaker . 
unfortunately , expensive ; 
cost range hundred dollar , depend 
brand panel box . 
must protect 
circuit say , pool heater , choice . 
one caveat -- gfci outlet bulky . 
may want use 
oversize box install . 
second thought , use 
large actually deep box everywhere . 
'll thank . 
incidentally , install ensure one 
specific outlet protect bathroom , 
really go trouble find first 
outlet circuit , could simply find first outlet 
bathroom , anything upstream . 

protect whole circuit prefer . 
install , good idea use little 
`` ground fault protect '' sticker come mark 
outlet downstream gfci . 
figure 
outlet `` downstream '' , simply trip 
test button see outlet dead . 
subject : purpose ground prong outlet , ? 
apart use electronics , comment , 
certain fluorescent light turn without 
good ground connection , intend guard 
insulation failure within device . 
generally , case 
appliance connect ground lead . 

insulation failure shorts hot lead case , 
ground lead conduct electricity away safely possibly 
trip circuit breaker process . 
case 
ground short occur , case live -- 
touch ground , 'll get zap . 

course , circuit , 
tiny zap -- use gfci replace

appliance never ground . 

particular , apply toaster anything else 
expose conductor . 
consider : touch heating 
electrode toaster , ground , nothing 
happen .

- nm cable protect mechanical damage 
pass floor surface wall 
expose location 5 foot floor . 
ie : use ac instead , flexible conduit , wooden guard etc. . 
- cable suspend , , connection furnace 
water heater , wire protect . 
canadian 
practice usually install junction outlet 
box wall , use short length ac cable 
nm cable flexible conduit `` jump '' appliance . 
staple nm piece lumber also sometimes use . 
- nm cable run close proximity heating 
duct pipe , heat transfer minimize 
means '' air space , suitable insulation 
material wad fiberglass . 
- nm cable shall support within ' every box 
fitting , interval 1.5 ' . 
hole joist stud consider `` support '' . 
slack cable provide adjacent 
box . 
fishing cable technically violation , 
permit `` proper '' support impractical 
- 2 conductor nm cable never staple edge . 
knight also insist one cable per staple , refer 
`` workmanship '' clause , seem honor

subject : use plastic metal box ? 
nec permit use plastic box non-metallic cable 
. 
reasoning simple -- armored cable , box 
provide ground conductor continuity . 
u.s. plastic 
box use metal cable clamp . 
cec slightly different . 
cec never permit cable 
armor ground conductor . 
however , must still 
provide ground continuity metallic sheath . 
cec also 
require grounding metal cable clamp plastic box . 
advantage plastic box comparatively minor even 
non-metallic sheathed cable -- avoid make one ground 
connection sometimes cost little less . 

hand , plastic box vulnerable impact .

concern include provide suitable ground 
fluorescent fixture , make sure ceiling box 
mount strong enough support weight heavy 
chandelier ceiling fan . 
may need install new box 
specifically list purpose . 
2x4 across ceiling 
joist make good support . 
metal bracket also available 
fish ceiling thru junction box hole

three phase power three `` hot '' wire , 120 degree 
phase . 
usually use large motor 
`` efficient '' , provide bit start torque , 
motor simpler hence cheaper .

subject : convert two prong receptacle three prong ? 
older home frequently receptacle instead 
modern three . 
receptacle safety

subject : aluminum wiring 
1970 's , aluminum instead copper wiring become 
quite popular extensively use . 
since time , 
aluminum wiring implicate number house fire , 
jurisdiction longer permit new installation . 
recommend , even allow , use new 
wiring . 
panic house aluminum wiring . 
aluminum 
wiring , properly install , safe copper . 
aluminum wiring , however , unforgiving improper 
installation . 
cover bit theory behind potential

main problem aluminum wiring phenomenon know 
`` cold creep '' . 
aluminum wiring warm , expand . 

cool , contract . 
unlike copper , aluminum go 
number cycle lose bit tightness 
time . 
make problem worse , aluminum oxidise , corrode 
contact certain type metal , resistance 
connection go . 
cause heat corrode 
oxidize still . 
eventually wire may start get hot , 
melt insulation fixture attach , possibly even 
cause fire . 
since people usually encounter aluminum wiring move 
house build 70 's , cover basic point 
safe aluminum wiring . 
suggest , consider purchase 
home aluminum wiring , discover later , 
hire licensed electrician inspector check wiring 
follow thing : 
1 fixture eg : outlet switch directly attach 
aluminum wiring rate . 
device 
stamp `` '' `` '' . 
latter supersede 
former , safe . 
fixture somewhat 
expensive ordinary one . 
2 wire properly connect least way around 
screw clockwise direction . 
connections 
tight . 
repeat tightening screw make 
problem worse , inspection would pay snug 
connection . 
note aluminum wiring still often use 
main service entrance cable . 
inspect . 
3 `` '' terminal extreme hazard aluminum wire . 
connection use terminal redone 
proper screw connection immediately . 
4 sign overheating : darken connection , 
melt insulation , `` baked '' fixture .

5 connections aluminum copper wire need 
handle specially . 
current canadian code require 
wire nut use must specially mark connect 
aluminum copper . 
nec require wire 
connect together use special crimp device , 
anti-oxidant grease . 
tool material latter 
quite expensive - practical unless 
rent tool . 
6 receptacle connect aluminum wiring 
means short copper `` pigtail '' . 
see 5 . 
7 show reasonable workmanship : neat wiring , properly strip 
nick wire etc. . 
, consider purchase home , inspection wiring 
show problem one two , believe consider 
wiring safe . 
sign problem many place , 
suggest look elsewhere . 
wrong receptacle use , 
replace proper type , use pigtail - 
professionally range $ 3 $ 10 per .

minor problem fix . 
sign problem many 
place , suggest look elsewhere . 
hint look : 
obvious wiring include : 
- zip cord wiring , either conceal nail wall 
- hot wiring identify neutral conductor without 
proper mark . 
- ungrounded ground outlet except downstream 

- splice hang mid-air proper 
- switch neutral 
- unsecured swing like grapevine 
certain wiring practise actually code one 
time sometimes reveal diy wiring may hide violation : 
- switch seem control nothing abandon , perhaps 
properly terminate wiring 
- wall switch shut group light 
separately control wall switch . 
except 
really convenient ; - 
- switch outlet bizarre location 
- great number junction box without outlet lamp 
- junction box great number wire go 
- wiring pass closet instead wall 
ceiling 
- grounding wire 
subject : weird stuff ? 
old style wiring 
year since edison `` invent '' electricity , several different 
wiring `` style '' come go . 
buy older home 
may encounter stuff . 
section describe old 
method , idiosyncrasy . 
oldest wiring system likely encounter call 
`` knob tube '' . 
make individual conductor 
cloth insulation . 
wire run along side structural 
member eg : joist stud use ceramic stand-off knob . 
wire run structural member use ceramic tube . 
connections 
make twist wire together , soldering , wrap 
tape . 
since hot neutral run separately , 
wiring tend rather confusing . 
neutral often run 
center room , `` tap '' fixture . 
hot wire tend run one fixture next . 

case colour-coded , neutral often 
color hot wire . 
'll see home build late 40 's . 
comment : 
- people install pretty paranoid 
electricity , workmanship tend pretty good . 
- wire , insulation insulator tend stand 
well . 
see , example , 
quite good condition . 
- grounding . 
grounding usually difficult install . 
- box small . 
receptacle replacement particularly 
difficult . 
bushing box either , 
wiring change need special attention box entry . 
- sometimes neutral balanced well 
separately hot circuit , sometimes possible 
overload neutral without exceed fusing 
circuit . 
- building code permit insulation wall 
contain . 
- connection exist new circuit 
tricky . 
consult inspector . 
- modern wiring practice require considerably 
outlet install system . 
since tend pretty decent condition generally 
necessary replace simply . 

watch renovation interfere 
cautious circuit loading . 
many case perfectly 
reasonable leave exist alone , add new fixture 
new circuit use modern technique . 
, invent cable . 
first type 
see roughly cloth varnish insulation . 
look 
much like cable last decade two . 
stuff 
use 40 's 50 's . 
, grounding conductor . 
install much like modern wiring . 
major drawback 
type insulation . 
see whole 
system insulation would fracture fall 
touch . 
bx cable vintage similar problem . 
stuff fragile , become rather hazardous 
wire become bare . 
wiring leave untouched 
much possible - whenever opportunity arise , replace . 
simple receptacle switch replacement turn several 
hour long frustrating fight electrical tape 
tubing . 
wiring technique , modern invent . 
almost asphalt impregnate cloth . 
often bit sticky . 
stuff stand reasonably well present hazard 
reasonably easy work . 
need 
replace - consider safe `` modern '' stuff - 
thermoplastic insulation wire . 
abuse much . 
subject : buy stuff ? 
try find proper electrical supply outlet near . 

price often considerably better chain hardware store 
diy centre , better quality material , wider variety 
include `` odd '' stuff , people behind counter 
know talk . 
cultivate friendly knowledgeable 
sale people . 
'll give much valuable information .
