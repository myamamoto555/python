beginning interview torre also say lankford 
one outfield 
guy `` matter '' . 
guess jordan eventually end odd man due low 
base percentage . 
whiten great acquisition ... decent offense 
great defense rightfield . 
worry , gilkey 
start 
soon jordan whiten display extended period low offensive 
output .
