well , suppose probe emit radiation constant frequency 
send towards black hole . 
get closer event horizon , 
red shift would keep increase . 
period would get longer longer , 
would never stop . 
observer would observe probe actually 
reach event horizon . 
detect energy probe would keep 
decrease , would vanish . 
exp - never quite reach zero . 
guess probably make thing clear , hopefully 
get general idea maybe .
