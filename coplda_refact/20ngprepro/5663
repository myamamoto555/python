someone help ? 
unfortunately , key event handling pretty much 
emac . 
run problem back ; solution 
change source code special key generate 
character sequence basically encode modifier 
state escape sequence -- example , sequence `` esc 1 b 7 '' 
would indicate `` home '' key press , shift key 
. 
could also detect standard key odd modifier , 
`` '' . 
anybody want change , welcome , ` ll 
source available comfortable mung 
bit . 
basically replace keypress handling code 
source file `` . 
c '' . 
maybe someone osf 
interested , send tweak , imagine get 
bigger fish fry hopefully include much talk 
emac ! 
. 
sufficient interest , 'll post mod 
somewhere , although probably appropriate group . 
note : 
special code apply let emac create 
x11 window . 
run plain old tty mode 
include window business usual . 
patch make version 18.58 , sun os 4.1.2 
also back hp-ux . 
patch 
chunk code ' sun ... ' could 
easily adapt anything else .
