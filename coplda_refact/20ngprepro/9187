> objective morality morality build objective value . 
dictionary philosophy , anthony flew : 
`` objectivism : belief certain moral truth would 
remain true whatever anyone everyone think desire . 

instance , ` one ever deliberately inflict pain another 
simply take pleasure suffer ' might think 
plausible example . 
even world sadist reject , 
contention remain true , ' 5 + 7 12 ' remain correct even 
one leave count . 
problem objectivist 
determine status moral truth method 
establish . 
accept judgement report 
relate ought see naturalistic fallacy 
prove fact nature world . 

analytic , since would involve lack 
content ; ` one ought always right thing ' plainly true 
virtue involve unhelpful practical guide 
action see analytic synthetic . 
point objectivist may 
talk ` self-evident truth ' , deny subjectivist 's claim 
mind beholder ? 
, leave 
claim moral judgement true ? 
subjectivist may 
well feel remain moral judgement 
would wish associate .

, suggest , know something true 
preference regard human activity . ''
