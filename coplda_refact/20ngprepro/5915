simply divide 
world atheist basis . 
care belief supernatural deity , 
nothing say behavior , belief supernatural 
criterion . 
start talk behavior , someone 's - 
lead bad people bad thing 
- assume - worried . 
area , care whether someone sceptical , 
critical autonomous one hand , gullible , excitable 
easily lead . 
would say tendency worship tyrant ideology indicate 
person easily lead . 
whether worship belief 
supernatural hero rather earthly one seem 
beside point .
