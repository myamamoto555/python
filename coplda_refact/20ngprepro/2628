would like point much easier place 
object orbital altitude place orbital 
velocity . 
target 300 km surface earth , 
need delta-v 2.5 . 
assume rocket specific 
impulse 300 seconds easy produce , rocket dry 
weight 50 kg would require 65 kg fuel + oxidizer . 
small dispersal charge embed 20 kg sand 
birdshot depend nature structure would 
payload . 
sure whole project well within 
capability amateur rocketry community . 
sound like good science fair project -- ` reduction 
light pollution applied ballistics ' . 
, could part challenge prize discuss 
: $ 1 billion first person spend 1 year 
moon , $ 1 million first 
orbital burner . 
$ 1000 
first person bring , sure 
least 999 astronomer , nature lover , 
plain people good taste would likewise . 
course , gerald bull solution might simpler . 
either solution gerald bull would apply -- use 
large caliber gun ; solution apply 
gerald bull -- use small caliber gun .
