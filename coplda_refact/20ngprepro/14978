would anybody clarify please . 
actually , number correct . 
difference direction 
acceleration . 
pilot , acceleration tend transverse 
direction face pull steep dive , 
acceleration force blood toward foot , instance . 

case , put 8 g 's even pressure suit . 
record acceleration , though , measure along `` direction 
face '' lack better term . 
recall , record 
set rocket sled back 60 's -- 40 g 's .
