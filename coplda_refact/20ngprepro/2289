understanding ` expected error ' basically 
know bug warning system software - thing check 
right value yet 
set till launch , suchlike . 
rather fix code 
possibly introduce new bug , tell crew 
` ok , see warning no. 213 liftoff , ignore ' . 
good grief . 
think shuttle software know 
well-engineered . 
actually case , every member 
programming team take shot . 
give hear shuttle software rate level 5 
maturity , strongly doubt case .
