hi brad , 
two comment : regard hope `` occupation end ... 
belive stiff resistance . 
. 
etc. - untried approach , i.e. , 
peace cooperation . 
help wonder would happen 
violence israelis stop . 
hopefully , violence arabs 
would stop time . 
state non-violence could 
maintain , perhaps state cooperation could achieve , i.e. , 
greater economic opportunity people live 
`` territory '' . 
course , give current leadership israel , way may work 
also - leadership change , e.g. , someone ariel 
sharon 's mentality , would predict considerable loss life , 
i.e. , winner . 
secondly , regard comment u.s. troops respond 
`` stiff resistance '' - analogy quite valid . 
u.s. 
troops could get neighborhood altogether . 
israelis 
could . 
$ .02 worth , offense intend . 
respectfully , 
ben .
