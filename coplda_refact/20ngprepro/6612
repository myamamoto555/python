remember one hit circa 1976 wrigley field go across 
street dead center field hit house roof . 

whiff lot , connect , watch ! 
best home run ever see come , believe , 
roger clemens sorry , val couple year ago . 
throw ball 
incaviglia literally inky 's neck , absolutely 
hammer crap . 
swing , clemens nonchalantly 
motion new ball -- even turn around look , 
even get upset . 
ball hit light left-field standard , 
70 foot green monster 100 foot 
ground total ! 
truly amazing shot .
