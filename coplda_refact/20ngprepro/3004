, salient difference ? 
find salient difference number 5th amendment 
related supreme court opinion . 
court limit 5th amendment 
protection call `` testimonial '' evidence , oppose 
physical evidence . 
whole question would hinge whether crypto key would 
consider `` testimonial '' evidence . 
suppose argument could make 
either way , though obviously would hope would consider 
testimonial .
