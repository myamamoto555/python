would like know , 6502 without irq , 
13 address line give 8k memory space .

know call - cia find 
commodore 64 believe chip exist 2600 around . 
tia map bottom 128 byte page 0 , shadow 
bottom 128 byte page 1 . 
get image screen , wait 
raster line picture start , load bitmap line 
` sprite ' register , tell x position take , many 
duplicate want , etc , next line . 

take processor 's time visible portion 
display .

. 
ram map top 128 byte page 0 , shadow page 
1 . 
6502 address mode instruction 
shorter faster normal one , important 
machine like ram page 0 . 
unfortunately , 
also want stack page 1 stack pointer 8 bit , 
high byte address 1 . 
iot section map page 2 somewhere . 
2 8 bit register 
remember bit could set o like 
, 1 ? 
8 ? 
bit timer programmable 
think power 2 . 
interrupt system , 
many game would set timer known time , go away 
something else , sit wait timer run . 
logic box address decode - riot 
least 2 chip select pin probably one active high , one active low , 
imagine tia much . 
various address line feed directly 
chip select . 
like rom right top memory , 
2600 use rom active high chip select - exactly 
normal , convert 
usual active low chip select .
