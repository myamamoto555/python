well , see could consider sin , 
first far know , male homosexuality explicitly 
mention bible , hook , think . 

event , plenty people many denomination 
consider person 's sexual identification 
`` immoral lifestyle choice '' 
> also , always somewhat liberal feminist , pro-choice , 
> seem pro-choice religious mix either .

another misconception . 
tell whole story . 
former minister lesbian , know personally 
professionally several openly gay lesbian minister . 

like denomination ,

need go look unitarian universalists 
liberal religion acceptance sexual 
identification pro-choice view , however ; many 
believe spirituality freedom conscience . 
good luck journey !
