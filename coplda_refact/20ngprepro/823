computer excellent example ... evolution without `` '' creator . 
`` create '' computer . 
create sand go 
silicon go integrate circuit go 
processor board . 
take thing put together 
interesting way . 
like plant `` create '' oxygen use light 
photosynthesis . 
much bigger leap talk something 
create `` everything '' nothing . 
find unfathomable resort 
believe creator much simpler alternative exist : 
simply incapable understand beginning -- even 
beginning . 
ok . 
present keep 
perfectly busy .
