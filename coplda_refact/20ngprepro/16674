since know electronics ham radio , seem 
remember pep actually 4x `` real '' power . 
make pep 
actually around . 
2x ? 
. 
`` effective transmitted power '' also `` odd '' , take account 
antenna height geometry . 
tv station klystron 
might advertise megawatt antenna top 
cn tower . 
like sears hp ; - 
though , 1500 real watt still impossible . 

12v alternator , less alternator produce higher voltage . 
three horsepower take account inefficiency . 
` ll 
feel hit key . 
much .
