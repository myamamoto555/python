mars observer status report 
april 30 , 1993 
11:30 pdt 
madrid 34 meter antenna acquire expect mars observer 
spacecraft signal schedule beginning track yesterday morning 
approximately 6:00 . 
indication spacecraft enter 
fault protection mode sometime time receipt normal 
telemetry end previous station pass - goldstone 34 
meter antenna approximately 8:00 pm evening . 
entry 
contingency mode verify signal reacquire telemetry 
indicate spacecraft sun coning . 
subsystem engineer 
report system perform nominally , fault protection telemetry mode 
reconfigure memory readout command system audit queue 
aac attitude articulation control subsystem perform . 

readout verify contingency mode entry occur shortly 1:30 
yesterday , . 
preliminary indication sun ephemeris check 
failure trigger fault protection . 
however , flight team 
determine precise cause next day . 
last evening , spacecraft command back inertial 
reference stable mode . 
flight team plan 
command spacecraft back array normal spin state today . 
magnetometer calibration activity complete prior contingency 
mode entry . 
mag calibration datum record digital tape 
recorder 2 3 . 
playback 2 3 , schedule complete 
yesterday , postpone contingency mode entry halt flight 
sequence c9 execution . 
flight team develop strategy restart 
c9 complete datum playback . 
present planning perform playback 
soon wednesday , late friday next week - 
, dependent contingency mode recovery activity . 
dtr playback 
perform via high gain antenna bit per second . 
upon 
verification successful dtr playback , downlink maintain 
4k & e rate .
