53 seconds hash 20m core bet know source 
information ! 
. 
, acceptable part login 
process . 
go use network traffic source 
pseudo-random information , right thing pass 
cryptographic hash function , compressor . 
aside fact 
run faster , give better result think 
cryptographic hash function `` distill '' randomness . 
something along line 
- - x - n | dd b 1k count 10 2 > | md5 
trick . 
- give timestamp , lack - u make 
sure dd get ten line oppose ten k. 
take couple seconds ethernet .
