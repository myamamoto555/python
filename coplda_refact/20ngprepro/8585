thursday 's sf chronicle typical one column trader 
ad page c7 sports section . 
, 
part middle rather prominently say `` want : pay 
cash assault rifle pistol . '' 
. 
grant , see today 's 
paper yet . 
would surprise trader ad . 
probably worth write chronicle papers 
anyway , anti-gun editorial disgust . 
way , let put plug trader . 
shop 
sf bay area never see another store lower 
price . 
selection amazing .
