2.0 l efi 
auto 
mile 
drive tha car long enough get hot especially 
highway speed transmission nasty habit 
get `` stick '' 3rd gear . 
result , stop 
light motor stall . 
put car park , wait 
30-60 seconds restart sometimes allow transmission 
`` reset '' go back 1st . 
otherwise , stall 
put drive . 
thought : either 3rd gear band bind get 
stick get hot likely perhaps lock-up 
converter disengage properly seem likely . 
least 
likely keep finger cross critical vacuum 
hose behavior due lack 
vaccuum somewhere use happen old modulator valve .
