datum ever read bar , course , 
eventually get turn 44.1 khz , 16 bit , two channel datum . 
oversampling take two discrete datum point , interpolate n-1 point 
n time . 
ask , people say 
interpolation simply linear interpolation , significantly 
complicate .

interpolate - linear interpolation though . 
correct 
frequency content alter specifically , baseband 
spectrum preserve , every nth image spectrum . 

n-1 n image spectrum remove , n oversampling rate

ecg waveform person 's 
ideally filter gain 1 , gain 0 
new nyquist frequency . 
practice finite transition 
band require , also certain amount ripple 
leakage . 
high order eg 200 tap digital filter , 
good approximation easily achieve .

, actually use digital fir like , build hardware , 
custom vlsi chip mainly economic reason . 
anyway , , purpose oversampling move `` effective '' 
sampling rate n time 44.1 khz , order use higher frequency 
filter . 
quality filter , higher oversampling 
let build cheaper filter , whereas price filter , higher 
oversampling let build better filter . 
, assume quality 
component cd player remain , 
allow manufacturer produce _ slightly _ better sound due 
filter .

guess answer somewhere two . 
interesting ? 
aside , may aware scheme 
use pioneer wadia , call pioneer , least legato 
link . 
hear one player , read advertising 
blurb , couple article deduce 
build lousy digital oversampling filter , let load 
first image ie spectrum . 
talk bob stuart 
boothroyd stuart , aka meridian confirm suspicion . 
say 
sound awful , would , would ...
