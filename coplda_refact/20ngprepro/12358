hmm , depend define ` clean ' . 
jordan implement system 
dependent stuff way basic implementation , 
call , operate system type , go ahead write include 
file specific machine operating system use basic 
implementation . 
since jordan encounter 
os flavor yet , fully posix , get around 
really implement test top-level include file specifically 
posix . 
posix routine use sun specific file 
. 
example , also use bsd stuff . 

still probably better implement include file 
every operating system ' ` ing exist one . 
type 
mess result clearly see 
source . 
even quite bit code get copy almost unchanged 
couple time , use disk space , since 
`` driver '' actually include include file 
compile emu . 
hard come . 
file fully 
rely posix stuff , unfortunately linux 
system available , port . 
would suggest 
read readme problem 
question , contact could try sort . 
unfortunately 
rely help net part emu , since 
access many different system .
