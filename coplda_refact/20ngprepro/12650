must object characterization oppose 
government 's handling waco situation `` gun supporter '' . 
argument try paint batf critic right-wing 
gun nut , mix two issue . 
one critic , yet liberal 
anti-gun . 
happen believe 
everyone civil rights , even religious crazy . 
human , nest wasp 
try exterminate . 
batf create crisis situation way handle 
original raid . 
well know koresh regularly 
go jogging outside property . 
could serve 
search warrant . 
could arrest 
refuse comply . 
instead officer arm grenade 
invade property . 
escalate shooting war 
tragic death side . 
first two mistake : bad judgment 
ask warrant , bad probably 
illegal way warrant serve . 
point , situation escalate 
describe armed standoff hostage crisis . 
government start cover trace , 
seal warrant , revise report history 
incident , etc. . 
thing already build disaster . 

government could simply close supply route 
wait . 
accord janet reno , option 
`` never seriously consider '' . 
, supposedly 
agent `` frustrated fatigued '' , 
supposedly backup , feel 
go . 
entirely possible koresh responsible 
fire . 
, deserve blame 
death people compound . 
government 's hand far clean . 
first raid demonstrate bad judgment plus 
contempt 4th amendment . 
motivation 
second raid unbelievable . 
coverup event first 
raid undermine credibility anything 
thereafter . 

bias fbi agent ' word happen . 
please let 's turn pro-gun v. anti-gun 
discussion . 
anti-gun people believe 
deserve get frontally assault armed government 
agent . 
koresh 's civil rights exist whether 
gun legal , illegal , , 
whatever !
