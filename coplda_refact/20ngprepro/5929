comment mean put . 
fail several reason : 
1 edit context action discussion . 
2 never bring legal definition . 
use english language 
legal dialect . 
legal definition fraud change 
one country another case . 
context discussion morality 
censorship .

, know person believe company endorse

extrapolate statement make concern circumstance 
act censorship would permissable teel case . 
bother read post instead try prove stupid 
think would rather better . 
mode argument use 
form rhetoric . 
argument example , describe wide set 
circumstance action demonstrate 
apply , thus action . 
obviously company post university adress would squashed , 
would contrary internet comercial use .

cost . 
decide company associate subscribe 
usenet usenet connection property company . 

quite legitimate company political agenda 
regulate use property accordance policy . 
example 
microsoft employee post `` windows nt crap buy '' 
microsoft machine would consider reasonable microsoft 
sack employee . 
way company decide 
political objective might wish regulate posting political 
manner . 
worse rupert murdoch use papers political 
platform view .

see , e.g. , opinion dissent law lord

refer initial hearing injunction judgment 
substantive case ? 
initial hearing government win judge 
judgment assertion government national interest might 
harm would grounds prior restraint . 
second set hearing 
substance judge government case official secret 
act could use suppress information public domain already . 
part win copyright issue rather separate . 
issue censorship rather different case 
information divulge understanding communicate 
third party . 
first ammendment certainly apply 
case numerous prosecution spy us prove . 
crux spycatcher affair british law . 
censorship aspect arise result government 's 
ludicrous attempt prevent summary case book .

funny see rejection assertion make . 
course 
reject assertion make contrary assertion , since assertion 
unprovable leave . 
far see demonstrate command contrary opinion 
. 
attack anti-censorship view dare accept 
validity argument reject conclusion . 
plus absolutist . 
funny idea solution 
problem decide 1789 group white male gentry secret 
session single line . 
furthermore think 
issue half simple imply .
