sparcstation elc take 
300 seconds compress 22 seconds ' worth speech . 
mean 
need `` optimize '' factor 10 usable 
even half-duplex mode . 
question whether celp best approach application . 
produce 
great compression expense tremendous cpu load . 
want 
something run ordinary workstation even high-end pc 's 
without dsp card . 
guess algorithm go 
better starting point .
