interested program easy use , strongly 
suggest approach 2.0 . 
extremely easy use , make report , etc. . 

paradox , almost never use paradox . 
need 
build complicated application , paradox way go . 

hear horror story access programming extremely cryptic . 
since seem like probably fairly small stuff work 
home use use database , recommend approach . 

find one small thing would like easily : 
one database order record enter must 
different logical order . 
permanently reorder 
use old dbase iii command record require sort record 
appropriately problem , since almost always use order 
export database another database still approach 
database , copy export file back original 
filename . 
small weakness , consider item really 
like approach . 
also little slower paradox 
loading , paradox take forever minute load . 
paradox also 
take lot memory hard disk around ram .
