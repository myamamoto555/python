commonly discuss question , though long enough 
'll allow ask . 
might expect , range 
answer . 
catholics say divorce never 
justified . 
way , situation someone abuse , 
serious cause , separation allow tradition 
know . 
one force stay situation 
danger . 
see last resort situation 
fall apart badly enough best hope 
choose lesser evil . 
sense difficult legal 
question turn divorce , remarriage . 

jesus ' statement mark 10:11 -12 par . 
many 
thing , turn approach bible . 
conservative 
protestants tend see statement like exception . 
liberal one willing make allowance situation 
literal interpretation would lead painful result . 
note 
time possible man divorce wife almost 
whim . 
thus common explanation liberal approach 
jesus try protect people sort thing , 
establish absolute rule could never 
exception . 
catholics , typical catholic ethic , take 
theoretical hard line , allow exception practice 
process . 
last discussion 
non-catholic reader seem accept reluctance 
case might good alternative , 
feel church often better job 
help people prepare marriage deal problem 
come , properly run church , divorce 
necessary .
