matt 's problem really ability attitude . 

get mind want swing away , rather 
still total sucker curve ball . 
look 
1990 get better still weak point . 
whether good bond behind , 
probably tell reason 
, think , might self-fulfilling 
prophecy . 
whether giants ' lineup optimal : know ? 
bat bond , 
team 's best hitter , fifth seem odd , # 1 # 2 
hitter exactly messrs. oba , give much 
. 
although clark overall offensive force bond 
, seem better suit # 3 spot . 
assume , course , 
start hit one day ...
