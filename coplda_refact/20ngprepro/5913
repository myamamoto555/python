hardware one clut ? 
since standard 
typically devour 256 entry , way avoid 
displace entire default hardware one 
clut . 
believe standard intend possible 
flash client use default . 
rather , 
flash avoid two client use 
standard . 
example would two client need 
full color range would use whatever 
call . 
try avoid flash default 
, best bet try load color use 
. 
, 'll get flash one 
hw clut framebuffer . 
window manager use standard 
client , flash could also avoid . 
perhaps window 
manager command line option select standard ?
