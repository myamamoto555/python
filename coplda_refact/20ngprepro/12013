help better ask question spout opinion . 
progress towards goal 30 year . 
precede 
orbit mission flyby mission . 
course , get harder 
work way farther away earth . 
start 
work outer planet : galileo orbit jupiter , cassini around 
saturn . 
> mission unmanned pluto stay orbit record thing 
> around near pluto . 
. 
well first thing first . 
'll flyby mission first since 
much easier faster . 
fast pluto flyby mission approve 
'll launch pluto mission end decade . 
pluto orbiter 
however require larger spacecraft longer cruise period . 
orbit 
insertion require fuel carry along restrict 
trajectory slower approach velocity pluto . 
would imagine though would neptune orbit 
mission pluto orbit mission , unless pluto flyby turn 
something really interesting .
