work base application need 
override window manager focus processing . 

use motif 1.1 currently , although also 
work open look future . 
need certain circumstance prevent 
user switching one window application 
another window . 
let 's say , example , window top 
window b window hierarchy . 
normally , user click 
mouse window b bring top 
window hierarchy place top window a. certain 
circumstance user click mouse window b need 
beep prevent window b raise top window 
a. 
research testing far , appear 
window order handle window manager , 
case motif . 
find way override default 
process standard x window function . 
tell 
switching occur focus change mapping 
notify event , find way tell motif make 
switch . 
temporary solution currently come 
partially work . 
detect window switch 
case switch allow , manually force 
formerly top window back top call 
beep function . 
provide necessary 
functionality look ugly window switch place 
twice . 
anyone know tell motif preferably 
window manager want window order switch 
actually take place ? 
respond either e-mail post 
newsgroup .
