fred rice answer already early post : 
`` problem argument _ know _ _ real _ 
believer may `` fake '' . 
something know 
person god . 
assumption anyone 
_ claim _ `` believer '' _ _ `` believer '' necessarily true . '' 
word seem nobody could define true 
false muslim . 
back square one , khomeini hussein 
still innocent define evil good islamic 
worshipper . 
cheers ,
