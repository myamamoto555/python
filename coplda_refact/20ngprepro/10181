yes , ... minimization gate important part 
timing consideration . 
ttl gate basic structure 
, inversion sum product 
exactly one gate delay . 
reason find minimal sum product 
match hardware optimization . 
gate solution use 
two gate delay another gate delay second term 
second solution , simpler logic symbol , 
expect something less optimal real world . 
ecl similar ttl , support 
gate minimum delay unlike ttl , get true 
inverse output ` free ' use ecl . 
pal basically large programmable 
gate choice internal connection 
various section , perhaps latch , minimum sum 
product also way shoehorn logic design 
pal . 
comparably easy design minimization 
logic gate , software package claim allow 
, take mess gate 
series logic ic produce description 
logic cell array job . 
xilinx 's software 
treat logic block macro , expand 
, simplify .
