basic question `` know suppose ? '' 
true every situation come . 
people 
think merely follow impulse . 
claim 
dangerous `` follow authority '' .

sexually transmitted disease , drug abuse , manner criminal 
activity , savings loan scandal , car accident , egg throw 
house , example people `` follow authority '' . 
could easily argue evil example give 
problem leader follow _ _ authority 
want .

question integrity fortitude . 
another freedom come task correctly . 
different people different level development different 
area . 
part challenge life find right authority 
follow , know everything everything . 
often 
learn new skill subject follow teacher , 
perhaps blindly . 
learn enough ask appropriate 
question question , develop 
skill enough challenge . 
, know 
get stage ? 
tell question authority , perhaps .
