`` impossible standard ? '' 
jesus say supercede law ? 
christian pauline ?

acknowledge reading paul . 
jesus say ? 
deny :14 -19 quite clear meaning ? 

christian pauline ?

please reread :14 -19 . 
christian pauline ?

> detail . 
say ten commandment ceremonial detail ? 
> paul 's conclusion similar . 
talk law

> `` ceremonial law '' , circumcision sabbath . 
quite 
> concerned maintain moral standard . 
call observance sabbath , day lord rest , 
ceremonial ? 
circumcision supercede christian ? 
... 
christian pauline ? 
. 
doubt mind sin 
, least case . 
jesus deal explicitly 
question whether law bind gentile . 

cite evidence way jesus deal centurion . 
general jewish view , dependent largely study 
pauline theology , one h.j. schoeps , one whose author 
come moment . 
author jews . 
also , various 
christian non-christian jews discuss issue 
newsgroup . 
mat 5:19 clear law still valid . 
say 
apply gentiles . 
yes , say specific requirement worship 
sabbath ten commandment ceremonial detail , ` re 
look obligation gentiles . 
similarly circumcision . 
sure quite else say subject . 
, 
unfortunate jesus answer question directly . 
however 
know 1 1st cent . 
jewish approach , 2 jesus 
deal least one gentile , 3 jesus ' disciple deal 
issue become acute refer act 15 
paul . 
give agreement , see 
big problem .
