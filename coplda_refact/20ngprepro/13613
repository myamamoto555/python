answer question ... `` private nonprofit foundation 
make money somehow '' , think time 
act like private hospital . 
personally , 
feed canadian socialist try tell everyone 
health care free actually buy insurance 
one , bob rae !! 
. 
gdp figure combine public private expenditure total 
outlay , compile use method oecd yield 
13-14 % figure u.s. 
> 
> us figure include dentistry optometry 
> canadian one recently , anyway ? 
since always evaluate oecd style , see 
... remember , oecd count private public fund , 
canada like france germany , 30 % health care spending 
private fund i.e. , basic health insurance money . 
> happen health care system financially collapse . 

? 
collect premium ... advocate 
copayment like french system ...

provincial insurance system find pay 
> get revenue , able pay 
> everybody 's primary care . 
yes , infrastructure . 
> everybody able continue use rate . 
minor copayment flush abuser . 
remember `` system '' 
insurance policy . 
cost rise fast 
enough ensure adequate ... last year , 
quebec 's proposal come number `` $ 5 '' 
necessary hike could copayment rather 
give qma raise . 
contract time yet , 
far tell upi clarinet ... 
even new reform party , breakoff traditionalist 
conservative mildly `` libertarian '' faction , hold public 
health insurance untouchable people 
remind free average 
fiscally naive american counterpart issue like . 
mention copayment anywhere see ... cut public 
spend place , bring back death penalty , 
little haste elect . 
> know , pete 's sake , live right border . 
know 
> canadian system socialize medicine unlike britain 's nh . 
sorry ! 
- ; even run people buffalo 
michigan know ... 
> point , mean money run low plan , 
> luck unless afford . 
yeah , would lot health-care crisis 
would preclude . 
provincial government bad 
; heck , ndp clean spending mess make 
conservative saskatchewan - embarass ! 
irresponsible , 
still reallocation -- health insurance important 
thing inspire open rebellion violent 
insurrection outside hockey rink .

system user learn good habit treat like 
oil ...

would

course , could eventually make money ,

company provide extra insurance subsidiary 
american company , parent provide full insurance 
. 
regardless , firm north easily turn cable tv 
see well american firm involve 
basic coverage . 
private firm make much money 
get rid basic coverage . 
run around pat - 
self back cooperation provide extra 
people `` deserve '' . 
> 
> yeah , eventually go create kind two-tiered 
> effect noticeable , like britain . 
americans fearful single-tier system ... - ; 
seriously , area sufficient population 
system like french ... health policy 
prof , d.g. shea , cite study nejm indicate 
population 500,000 necessary adequate competition ... 
canada , four city west great lake 
population larger . 
anyways , number show cost hold steadier 
u.s. bar future crisis , sudden 
transient spending unlikely . 
fact , health allocation 
one well-behaved sector spend north 
talk bankruptcy talk-radio fodder far away border . 
> province hit fiscal rough spot cut back , 
> thing private insurer offer seem less less like 
> luxury gap noticeable . 
overnight , something like would force canada 
system like french one ... bad 
thing , change minimal i.e. , add copayment 
frustrate socialist chant `` hey , free ! ''
