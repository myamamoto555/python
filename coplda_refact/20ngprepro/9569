2 islamic teaching teach harm innocent . 
qur ` 
explicitly teach harm innocent even time war . 
blow wtc harm innocent therefore blatant 
contradiction islamic teaching .

see ? 
deny fact . 
thrust argument 
salameh , accord us law , innocent find 
guilty court law . 
guilt establish , 
wrong people make posting base assumption . 
b islam teach _ _ harm innocent . 
muslims -- perhaps 
realize islam teach -- perform action , 
_ _ _ _ teaching islam , rather _ spite _ 
_ contradiction _ teaching islam . 
important 
distinction . 
clarify muslims usually mean say `` muslim '' . 

general , anyone call `` muslim '' 
outwardly profess 
something clear contradiction essential teaching islam 
consider muslim . 
thus , one might thing contrary 
islam ignorance , example suddenly _ _ become 
muslim . 
one knowingly transgress islamic teaching essential 
principle , though , one leave islam . 
term `` muslim '' contrast `` mu ` min '' , mean `` true 
believer '' . 
however , whether muslim reality mu ` min 
something know god perhaps person . 

find term mu ` min use much muslims , 
know anybody except god , whether , 
example , `` true believer '' . 
example , could 
put show , reality believe something opposite 
write , without anyone know . 
thus , say `` muslims '' 
mean outwardly profess follow islam , whether 
practice might , ignorance , transgress islamic teaching . 

`` muslim '' necessarily mean `` mu ` min '' , `` true believer '' 
islam .
