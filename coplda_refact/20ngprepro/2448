well , look like folk loosen 
bit discuss topic well 
topic . 
book subject also mention addition 
one mention . 
may hard find , think may 
take stab curiosity . 
know one film see 
subject pretty weak two quote see 
use show science koran post also pretty 
vague . 
suspect book extrapolate awful lot 
quote . 
least one poster islam channel seem misgiving 
practice use koran decide good science . 
wonder islam ever come equivalent christian 
`` creation science '' topic . 
would interesting find history 
scientific interpretation koran , see anyone use koran 
support earlier science since discard . 

easy look science exist today `` interpret '' passage 
match finding . 
people similar thing saying 
nostradamus time . 
anyway , rather unique claim islam may worth checking .
