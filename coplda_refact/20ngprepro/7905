precisely say . 
among , see olney 's `` food - relevance

whose talk `` food science '' ?

would know olney casually refer

olney 's research compare infant human diet . 
specifically , amount 
freely available glu mother 's milk versus commercial baby food , 
vs. typical lunch item standard american diet package 
soup mix . 
find one could exceed project safety margin 
infant human least four-fold single meal process 
food . 
mother 's milk well effective dose .

olney 's work provide putative causal mechanism 
sensitivity . 
terry , martin show orally 
administer msg cause change normal hormone 
adult . 
glu also find induce immediate persistant 
supression rhythmic gh secretion , induce rapid transient 
release prolactin adult chronically expose msg . 
gh 
responsible control growth development , 
also convert glycogen glucose .
