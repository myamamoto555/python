agree desire beauty valid , think desire 
impose vision beauty . 
mention age-old desire 
somehow get , ignore beauty actual 
vision . 
mention beauty dark sky , impede 
effect human , ignore beauty 
sky visible space , vision , least , 
descendent , may one day able see , part , effort 
call ugly . 
one day , hope , human able look , 
upon half heaven , light , upon 
heaven , light . 
advertising space help reach 
goal , less beautiful way reach , 
` pristine ' sky yesteryear , totally 
unreachable . 
one original conception beauty 
sculpture human form , effort strive reach goal . 
think reason believe modernity change , 
change way strive . 
btw , place people foul . 
sometimes make 
better .
