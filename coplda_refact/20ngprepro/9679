first , monophysites inherit none nestorius 's version -- 
opposite end spectrum . 
second , historical 
record suggest position attribute nestorius 
extreme successful opponent write conventional history 
claim . 
mainly nestorius oppose term theotokos mary , argue 
think correctly human could call mother god . 
mean , 
athanasian creed talk son `` '' -- surely even 
arians would concede jesus exist long mary . 
anyway , nestorius 's 
opponent claim say mary theotokos , claim 
give birth human nature jesus , would require 
two seperate distinct nature . 
argument fail though , 
mary simply give birth jesus , either divinely , 
accept `` nestorianism '' commonly define , nature intertwine , 
la chalcedon . 
second , sure `` nestorianism '' better alternative 
orthodox view . 
, find hard believe 
jesus 's human nature heaven ; likewise . 
think 
rather god come earth take nature upon . 
seperate 
nature , capable tempt gethsemane since believe divine 
nature could never tempt moment weakness divine nature 
prevail . 
comment warmly appreciate .

may difference mean `` subject sin '' . 

original complaint someone see could call 
jesus fully human , sin . 
completely agree 
jesus subject temptation . 
simply object idea 
succumb , thereby fully human . 
believe 
sin order human . 
apologize confusing nestorianism monophysitism . 

agree , say elsewhere , reason think 
everyone associate heretical position 
fact heretical . 
scholar maintain nestorius 
nestorian . 
confess first time read 
correspondence nestorius opponent , think 
get better . 
however , scholar believe work eventually lead 
chalcedon advance , nestorius least 
`` rash dogmatic '' editor `` christological controversy '' 
refer reject approach . 

regular usenet reader know , narrowness much 
impediment wrong . 
furthermore , say thing 
think problematical . 
respond rather mild letter 
cyril flame worthy usenet . 
say `` attribute also 
logos , name incarnation characteristic 
flesh conjoin ... , brother , 
either work mind truly err fashion 
greeks mind diseased insane heresy arius 
apollinaris . 
thus carry away 
idea association bind , , make divine 
logo part feed milk participate 
degree stand need angelic assistance 
fearfulness ... thing take falsely put 
deity become occasion condemnation 
perpetrate falsehood . '' 
well good maintain proper distinction 
humanity divinity . 
whole concept incarnation base 
exactly idea divine logo fact `` 
degree '' part bear , grow , die . 
course 
must understand certain logo ' 
participation thing . 
must sort 
identification divine human , 
incarnation . 
nestorius seem think black white 
term , miss sort nuance one need deal 
area . 
say `` find hard believe jesus 's 
human nature heaven . '' 
think require 
orthodox doctrine . 
divine logo eternal .
