effort make remove sticker . 
come piece , leave 
firmly attach window . 
dark , around 
10:00 pm . 
sticker mangled ineffective attempt 
tear warn car would tow remove . 

`` reasonable person '' would arguably drive car . 

accident occur , think friend 's attorney would much 
trouble fix blame apartment mangement . 
practical matter , even without conviction , cost 
inconvenience defend suit would considerable . 
moral matter , pretty fucking stupid thing 
paltry violation parking without authorization sticker btw , 
`` somebody '' spot , , unassigned , 
parking .
