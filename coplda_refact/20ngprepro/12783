see coursework , cpus never actually 
`` idle '' . 
continue service interrupt , etc. , 
etc. . 
clock always run n mhz matter 
. 
suppose depend instruction , cpu may use 
circuitry transistor 
instruction , consider additional heat 
generate handful additional , tiny resistor 
spread heat dissipation cpu 's 
packaging , change temperature immediate 
environment ie . 
surface package 
negligible . 
cheers , ben
