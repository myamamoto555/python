darn . 
think understand something someone know

glomerular disease , 'll really get depress . 
seriously though , wonder someone cph would end get 
biopsy first place ? 
understanding feel free correct 
enzyme worst mildly elevated , overall normal 
hepatic function . 
would think clue might history 
prior infection positive . 
indeed 
continuum cah , distinction merely one pathology 
prognosis , otherwise identical clinical feature ?
