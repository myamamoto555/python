seem likely large subset encrypted communication 
would archive tape could read sometime future 
probable cause arise warrant obtain . 
even imagine

valid warrant issue key obtain . 
imagine archive conversation , someone turn

archive call suspect mafia member , potential terrorist , 
radical , etc. . 
imagine convenience police able 
get warrant listen call world trade center
