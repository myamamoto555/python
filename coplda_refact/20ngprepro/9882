notice say book . 
call `` easy reading . '' 
reason 
drop philosphy major run many 
simon 's . 
know many walk encyclopedia 's run across 
philosphy class . 
problem know sooooo much 
average lay person , problem come become puff . 
schaeffer fine average lay person . 

. 
suppose would criticise john gospel 
simple . 
talk schaeffer one one . 
lecture 
man drill philosphy student prof 's secular 
well christian university . 
nd alone would fill catagory 
answer enough prof 's often take back 
cause re-think question . 
see time time 
different open forum . 
yes , book large , well , 
simplistic . 
certainly grad level reading . 
must get 
high horse come recommend reading . 
seriously think 
people would get first chapter wittgenstein ? 
may 
say secular scientist another time . 
also , one must finally get beyond doubt cause insistent 
inquisitiveness . 
one live life constantly doubt 
base . 
look , christian wholeheartedly support genuine rationality . 
must 
add qualification give balance . 
christianity second none 
keep reason place . 
never know value thing know 
limit . 
put unlimited value something end exhaust 
value ! 
thoroughly rational least bit rationalistic . 
also explain curious fact rationalism , christian 
faith , lead irrationality . 
forget limit thing , 
fly face reality learn simple ironic 
lesson life : 
`` without limit less ; less limit . '' 
often state , freedom without form soon become form 
freedom . 
let 's put another way . 
rationality faith implacably oppose 
absurdity quarrel mystery . 
think . 
tell 
difference two let . 
christianity 's contention 
rationalism much reason , 
little else . 
christian come faith understanding trust 
go hand hand , continue faith trust may sometimes call 
go without understanding . 
principle suspend judgment apply . 
time 
christian faith let god god , must suspend judgment 
say , `` father understand trust . '' 
read 
objection statement . 
say understand 
, trust anyway . '' 
mean `` understand 
situation understand trust anyway '' therefore 
trust understand even though . 
former mystery 
unrelieved rationality indistinguishable absurdity . 
latter 
statement rationality faith walk hand hand mystery 
faith . 
... principle suspend judgment irrational . 

leap faith walk faith . 
believer always know 
, know trust god know make 
difference . 
, one obvious snag part 
company philosophy - eminently reasonable theory rather bit 
difficult practice . 
practice pressure mystery act faith 
like insistent `` '' 3 year old . 
would like 
know know feel must know 
know . 
one produce frustration curiosity deny ; 
lead genuine anguish . 
specifically poorer understanding 
come faith necessary understand everything 
come faith . 
know trust god , always need 
know exactly god order trust . 
fail grasp 
, may able trust , anything understand may 
count able trust . 
, hand , know trust god , able trust 
situation understand . 
many xian 
leader teach christian window back head 
allow understand every foot fall god may 
ambiguous , inherently contradictory ! 
may mystery 
, mystery inscrutable ; would insufferable absurdity . 
friend , conclusion theory 
practice .
