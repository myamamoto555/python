alone . 
old 83 accord hand sibling much 
better engagement clutch . 
even old 84 civic keep beater 
feel better aspect . 
note car 250,000 km 
140,000 km respectively . 
90 prelude blow away every 
respect except smooth clutch engagement . 
course kawasaki best 
bunch need 2 wheel time . 
prelude dud clutch day 1 , three year 67,000 
km better . 
best luck feel free add collection .
