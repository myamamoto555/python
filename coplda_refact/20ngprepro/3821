point . 
depend ambitious 
concerned compliance general 
interface item like traversal . 
one widget list lot people 
already write , sure , would therefore probably 
subclass list rather something simple like xt class . 
difficult principle , line code ? 
sure ask . 
could create something 
much like true list place 
several list within geometry manager , put 
manager within automatic scroll window . 
would 
good large list , might consider 
alternative . 
alternatively , anyone list widget 
could sell , might save write one !

yet spec ?

widget set , one might list
