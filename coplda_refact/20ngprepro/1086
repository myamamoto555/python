bill , kid . 
firstly , motorcycle steer 
- rider . 
secondly , adhesion 
tyre road , suspension geometry ground clearance 
motorcycle dictate quickly swerve avoid obstacle , 
knowledge physics rider 's ear . 
seriously 
suggest knowledge enable corner faster 
competently could manage otherwise ??

formal training country far aware include 
theory . 
find six year ago , 
physics lecturer also motorcyclist . 
believe 
first say steer bike right make turn left , 
go analyze closely , realize 
right ! 
interesting bit knowledge , lot fun since 
tell , first sceptical . 

- interesting bit knowledge , claim 
essential biker know , corner faster 
better result , absurd . 
formal training view absolutely essential go 
able ride bike properly safely . 
include countersteering 
theory newbie course confusing people unnecessarily , right 
time far important matter learn . 
original point .
