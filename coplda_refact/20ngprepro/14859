remove , unless register ? 
get ta joking , right ? 
happen get program , install , 
decide like . 
register able get rid 
? 
hell , , last thing would think ! 
mean , would better make pretty sure , 
statement effect print loud clear package ! 
better way implement mention scheme allow 
anyone install program , register , get 
additional feature enable . 
could mean one new . 
exe file need 
copy , get program . 
course anyone _ free _ _ delete _ _ remove _ program whatever 
time like . 
still , face trouble ` move ' new . 
exe file around . 

could solve user register self , get back 
specially mark new . 
exe file . 
sort limitation , suggestion : 
limit size datum program work , 
disable save datum , 
print defect output sure mark 

let pop-up screen appear ca. 10 sec . 
program start 
exit 
etc. ... 
_ must _ register able remove .
