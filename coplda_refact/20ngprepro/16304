, think couple group may well .

carefully enforce 
another issue . 
doubt homosexual 
pastor every denomination , open . 
argument biblical issue , 
attempt summarize issue : 
commonly cite reference favor acceptance 
homosexuality previous discussion john boswell : 
`` christianity , social tolerance , homosexuality '' , u chicago press , 
1980 . 
argument pretty clear . 
several explicit law 
ot , e.g. leviticus 20:13 , rom 1 paul seem pretty negative 
homosexuality . 
beyond reference , debate . 

passage often cite subject probably relevant . 
e.g. 
sin inhabitant sodom propose carry 
homosexual rape , homosexual activity consent adult . 
even question whether homosexual , since 
entity involve angel . 
particularly horrifying 
involve guest , responsibility towards guest 
culture strong . 
probably reason lot 
offer daughter -- better give daughter 
allow guest attack . 
look concordance 
reference sodom elsewhere bible , 'll see 
seem imply homosexuality sin . 
jewish 
interpretive tradition major sin abuse guest . 

rate , debate homosexual rape wrong . 
discuss leviticus law part set 
law christian consider binding . 
unless nt 
justification find , lev . 
alone would settle issue . 
nt reference paul 's letter . 
number 
reference paul list sin word fairly 
vague . 
boswell argue word occur list 
mean homosexual . 
say : two greek word appear 
list i.e. cor 6:9 tim 1:10 
. 
unfortunately entirely clear word 
actually mean . 
, basic meaning soft , variety 
metaphorical meaning ethical writing . 
boswell suggest 
`` wanton '' likely equivalent . 
also report unanimous 
interpretation church , include greek-speaking christian , 
passage refer masturbation , meaning 
vanish 20th , practice come less 
. 
cite reference late 1967 edition 
catholic encyclopedia identify masturbation . 

translate male prostitute , give evidence none 
church father understand term refer 
homosexuality general . 
technical meaning , suggest 
early latin translation , would `` active mode homosexual male 
prostitute '' , view paul intend technically . 
conservative view , consult gordon fee 's commentary 
cor . 
cite evidence often mean effeminate . 
however boswell warn greek culture effeminate 
necessarily synonymous homosexual , though may associate 
kind homosexual behavior . 
give boswell fee 
say take together , suspect term simply 
definite , apply homosexual case , 
general term homosexuality . 
fee argue 
boswell well , end suggest 
translation seem essentially . 
big problem 
word almost never use . 
paul 's writing first 
occurence . 
fact word clearly compose `` male '' 
`` f k '' unfortunately quite tell meaning , since 
tell whether male subject object 
action . 
example compound word form either way give . 
theory could refer rapist , etc. . 
dangerous base 
mean purely etymology , 'll conclude `` goodbye '' 
religious expression base `` god ye '' . 
however 
since boswell , fee , niv seem agree `` homosexual male 
prostitute '' , seem good guess . 
note 
translation miss strong vulgarity term however something 
fee boswell agree , attempt reproduce 
translation . 
opinion , strongest nt reference homosexuality romans 
1 . 
boswell point rom 1 speak homosexuality something 
happen people naturally heterosexual , result 
corruption due worship false god . 
one could argue 
simply example : homosexual worshipped false 
god , would also fall degradation perhaps become 
heterosexual . 
however find argument somewhat force , 
fact homosexual reader seriously propose 
paul mean . 
however convince rom 1 sufficient create law 
homosexuality christian . 
paul describe rom 
1 homosexuality among christian -- homosexuality 
appear among one part whole package wickedness . 
despite impression leave impassioned rhetoric , sure paul 
believe pagan completely abandon heterosexual sex . 
give description situation , rather assume 
heterosexual sex would also debase shameless . 
yes , 
believe passage indicate negative view homosexuality . 
fairness , `` shameless '' nature act 
reflection general spiritual state people , 
specific feature homosexuality . 
overall view situation following : think 
enough evidence confident paul disapprove 
homosexuality . 
rom 1 seem clear . 
cor 6:9 tim 1:10 
unambiguous general condemnation homosexuality , 
seem like wording would come someone approve 
homosexuality even consider acceptable case . 

hand , none passage contain explicit teaching 
subject . 
rom 1 really idolatry . 
refer homosexuality 
pass . 
result situation people interpret passage 
light general approach scripture . 
look 
scripture law issue , surprising 
would consider passage nt endorsement ot 
prohibition . 
whose approach bible liberal , 
surprising regard paul 's negative view 
homosexuality something take jewish upbringing 
without serious reexamination light gospel . 

reader group know , assumption behind 
approach radically different people tend foam 
mouth see oppose view describe . 
lot 
moderator situation . 
number discussion past centered around sort 
detailed exegesis text describe . 
however fact 
convince defender homosexuality actually base 
belief analysis . 
real issue seem rest 
question whether paul 's judgement apply modern 
homosexuality . 
one commonly make claim paul simply never face kind 
question try deal . 
encounter homosexuality 
context people would probably agree 
wrong . 
never face experience christian try act 
`` straight '' fail , never face christian try 
define christian homosexuality , fit general christian 
ideal fidelity see sexuality mirror 
relationship god man . 
unfair take paul 's 
judgement homosexuality among use make 
judgement question . 
another following : paul 's time homosexuality associate 
number thing christian would find acceptable . 

part temple prostitution . 
among private citizen , often 
occur adult child free people slave . 

position say always , 
reason think . 
ancient distinguish active 
passive partner . 
consider disgraceful free adult 
act passive partner . 
reason active 
mode homosexual prostitute would consider disgraceful . 

customer would people enjoy passive role . 

support idea would tend engage two 
free adult male , least without degree scandal . 
clearly christian homosexual would condone sex child , 
slave , position fully responsible 
partner . 
however fee 's commentary cor cite example 
ancient literature homosexual relationship seem involve 
free adult reasonably symmetrical way . 
thus consideration 
paragraph push far . 
homosexuality may 
discredit jew association , 
surely must case prostitute 
involve slave child . 
people argue aid judgement 
homosexuality . 
would like point aid transmit 
promiscuous sex , homosexual heterosexual . 
someone 
homosexual relationship meet christian criterion marriage 
risk aid . 
note good reason paul 's general approach doubt 
would concede homosexuality fully equal alternative , 
apart specific statement homosexuality . 
believe 
use genesis story would lead regard heterosexual 
marriage god ordain . 
however way paul deal pastoral question provide warning 
quick deal issue legally . 
claim question counsel homosexual christian 
entirely theological issue , also pastoral one . 
paul 's 
tendency , see issue eat meat celebrate 
holiday , principle pastoral issue 
look carefully good people involve , 
avoid insist perfection would personally damaging . 
example , paul clearly believe acceptable eat 
meat , want avoid push people action 
personal qualm . 
another example , paul obviously 
would prefer see people least circumstance 
remain unmarried . 
yet unable , certainly 
would rather see married state might 
tempt fornication . 
believe one could take view like even accept 
view paul express rom 1 . 
one may believe homosexuality 
god intend , occur result sin , still 
conclude time live . 
note 
creation story work enter human life result sin . 

mean christian stop work save . 

question whether believe homosexuality sinful 
whether believe misfortune broad sense 
due human sinfulness . 
willing consider latter 
approach , become pastoral judgement whether 
damage cause find way live try cure . 
danger try cure attempt often 
fail , , end damage range 
psychological damage suicide , well broken marriage 
attempt live heterosexual fail . 
go depend upon one 's assessment inherent nature 
homosexuality . 
believe serious wrong , 
may willing run high risk serious damage get rid . 
clearly generally suggest people live tendency 
steal drug addiction , even though attempt cure 
condition also difficult . 
however condition 
intrinsically damage way obvious 
homosexuality . 
many problem associate homosexuality 
actually problem promiscuity , homosexuality . 
include 
aids . 
take grant sort homosexual 
relationship christian would consider allow would equivalent 
christian heterosexual relationship . 
course discuss last decade , ` ve 
hear lot personal testimony fellow christian 
situation . 
also see summary various research 
result various effort `` conversion '' . 
aside 
presbyterian report mention , faq summarize 
reader ' report question . 
evidence 
long-term success change orientation rare enough 
par healing miracle . 
danger advise christian 
depend upon change clear : `` conversion '' happen , 
almost always , people often leave despair , feeling 
exclude church nothing say requirement 
life-long celibacy . 
paul recognize though different 
context demand practical people , 
think history clerical celibacy strongly reinforce 
judgement . 
practical result homosexual end gay 
sex club rest sordid side homosexuality . 
maybe 
homosexuality god 's original ideal , well imagine paul 
prefer see people long-term , committed christian 
relationship promiscuity . 
work -- genesis 
suggest part god 's original ideal either -- think 
relationship still vehicle people share god 's love 
. 
issue biblical interpretation underlie 
discussion . 
issue `` cultural relativism '' . 
, 
paul say something wrong , take 
eternal statement , thing wrong specific situation 
culture time ? 
conservative christian generally insist 
take prohibition absolute , since otherwise bible become 
subjective -- stop consider everything 
relative ? 
look issue , worth note one completely 
reject concept cultural relativism . 
number 
judgement new testament even conservative christian 
consider relative . 
follow judgement least 
clear bible anything say homosexuality : 
- prohibition charge interest occur 18 time 
ot -- nt , mention 
relatively recently church consider bind 
christian 
- prohibition swearing oath 
- endorsement slavery institution 
- judgement tax collector sinner 
regard item binding . 
case , believe 
argument essentially one cultural relativism . 
briefly : 
- prohibition interest appropriate specific 
agrarian society bible try build , 
market economy . 
- people believe american judicial oath 
characteristic kind oath jesus 
concerned 
- people believe paul simply tell people 
live within slavery , endorse 
institution 
- people believe irs morally equivalent 
roman tax farming 
point try make apply biblical 
prohibition 20th , need look whether 20th 
cent . 
action . 
christian homosexual say 
relationship different greek homosexuality paul 
would familiar , exactly kind 
argument make judicial oath tax collector . 
fairly recently christian prohibit take interest , 
many christian regard slavery divinely endorse . 
indeed , 
slavery one common metaphor relationship 
god human -- christian often call servant 
slave god . 
try say everything bible culturally 
relative . 
rather , try say thing , 
therefore enough say something appear 
bible , end discussion . 
need look whether 
action talk moral implication 
one bible talk . 
christian want argue 
reason think prohibition 
homosexuality still bind , willing listen . 

claim question need look kid 
unless part small minority really obey 
rule list . 
one thing worry great emotion issue 
create . 
consider weakness biblical evidence -- 
law leviticus , passage rom whose subject matter 
really idolatry rather homosexuality , couple list whose 
word ambiguous -- amount concern raise among 
christian seem rather proportion . 
suggest 
people reason simply biblical involve . 
true side -- clearly homosexual christian 
strongly motivate find way discrediting biblical argument 
conservative christian find biblical argument . 

help feeling bible use side way 
justify attitude come source . 

dangerous situation christian . 
side issue , would like note problem 
position commonly present . 
one common argument homosexuality biologically 
determine . 
i.e. `` god make homosexual '' , choice . 

think `` god make homosexual '' fine view people already 
believe grounds homosexuality acceptable . 

see argument acceptability . 
many people think largely biological , drug 
addiction may turn well . 
mean ok . 
particular thing tend wrong . 
people 
get angry easily . 
tend arrogant . 
tend 
woman marry someone else . 
homosexuality 
view wrong would different 
thing . 
go follow god , end one time 
another work overcome bad habit particular 
temptation cause problem . 
none sit back say 
god make way relax . 
jesus 
say , take cross daily . 
concept die 
self also appear throughout paul 's letter seem 
suggest go thing 
call accept . 
paul 's letter experience 
christian throughout history show sin ingrain , 
battle lifelong difficult . 
fact 
homosexuality difficult fight necessarily say ok . 
maybe place die self . 
would like 
make sure think fight battle 
somewhere else , reject concept christian 
fight deeply engrained habit sin .
