labor 's enclave policy occupied territory 
israel shahak 
publ . 
middle east international , london , 
difficult discover israel 's policy towards 
palestinians give time . 
easily infer 
fact ground information 
provide hebrew press . 
one condition , 
though . 
torrent claptrap `` peace 
process '' must totally ignore , must israel 's official 
pronouncement , whole sole purpose distort reality . 
concentrate fact , early apparent 
labor 's policy different 
shamir greater reliance deceit 
effective implementation . 
likud 's policy accurately describe ariel 
sharon article , accompany map , yediot 
aharonot last august . 
sharon plan envisage 
division west bank seven , gaza strip 
four , `` autonomous '' palestinian enclave , 
israeli supervision . 
total area 
enclave amount 15 per cent 
territory . 
rest control israeli 
settlement highway build around enclave . 
entire area around jerusalem , outskirts 
ramallah boundary bethlehem , already 
turn `` greater jerusalem '' arab - 
inhabit locality amount small enclave surround 
area occupy israeli settlement reserve 
. 
judge labor 's settlement policy , may 
assume may content lesser number 
arab enclave rather larger size sharon 
plan . 
principle surround enclave 
settlement strategically disperse along highway 
remain unchanged . 
labor plan four enclave 
west bank : two `` samaria '' two `` judea '' i.e. 
north south jerusalem respectively , 
two gaza strip . 
regard `` greater 
jerusalem '' , labor 's policy hardly deviate 
sharon 's . 
saner version likud policy 
israeli correspondent realize , labor 
policy saner version sharon 's 
extravaganza . 
last july , gideon write yediot 
aharonot , `` barely month ago '' labor 
support demand freeze construction beyond 
green line , `` specific decision freeze 
construction territory take '' . 
uzi 
benziman write ha'aretz `` far judge 
basis internal political discussion 
jerusalem , rabin intend stick likud 's way '' . 
two biggest enclave envisage labor 
located `` samaria '' . 
therefore belt settlement 
around `` highway '' , design 
separate enclave , paramount 
importance . 
accord latest datum , percentage 
israeli settler entire west bank population 
apart east jerusalem mere 5.5 per cent . 

area around `` highway '' , 
corresponding figure almost 20 per cent , 
increase steadily . 
situation settlement 
`` efrat block '' south jerusalem , design sever 
enclave around bethlehem one around 
hebron , pretty much . 
`` efrat block '' 
connect west jerusalem highway . 
project costly extreme , highway 
design bypass bethlehem sequence long 
tunnel . 
final decision build highway 
suspend rabin 's return us visit 
march . 
subsequent decision renew construction 
see us approval enclave plan 
whole . 
process impoverishment 
enclave plan imply deliberate steady 
impoverishment palestinians . 
well know 
israel ignore abroad 
concerned , include plo . 
regard gaza strip , 
whole process best describe ze'ev shiff 
ha'aretz march . 
mention see `` pamphlet 
issue six year ago civil administration 
forecast condition gaza strip israeli 
rule 2000 '' . 
analysis deserve quote 
extensively : 
`` continue steal strip 's water , even though 
quality deteriorate year year . 
continue 
steal strip 's tiny land resource , order find 
settlement , deliberately 
want make inhabitant despair , 
despair think nothing lose . 

strip 's worker must 
spend travel workplace almost much time 
spend work . 
military point view , 
keep control half strip 's 
area increasingly exorbitant price manpower 
resource . 
year moshe arens leave 
defense ministry , hear say 
withdraw strip come may . 
argument 
israel sink strip ever deeper 
deeper . 
tell propose yitzhak 
shamir reject . '' 
yitzhak rabin reject . 
enormous state support qatif block settler 
also cite proof enclave plan 
implement . 
qatif block settlement , found 
first rabin government 1974-77 , intend 
divide gaza strip two separate enclave . 
efraim 
davidi davar datum show vital israeli 
enterprise . 
`` qatif block produce 40 
per cent israeli tomato destine export , 
substantial proportion cut flower . '' 
also deal 
subsidy settler receive , considerably 
augment present government . 
owe , 
housing unit cheap . 
present government 
spare effort recruit new settler block . 
`` prospective settler get 95 per cent mortgage 
house top grant 18,000 shekel 
$ 6,500 . '' 
datum show israel 's plan apply whether 
palestinians gaza strip allow forbid 
work israel . 
economic motivation explain 
danny rubinstein ha'aretz march : 
`` economic viewpoint gaza could already 
seal hermetically strip 's worker could 
bar enter israel ... even though accurate 
datum hard come , indisputable 
last two year gazan worker arrive 
daily work israel markedly decrease , 
80,000 mid '80 40,000 today . 
decrease 
due restriction impose enter israel 
gaza . 
also due drastic curtailment 
demand gazan labor israel . 
unemployment 
israel soar construction apartment 
block virtually halt , worker gaza 
longer really need ... '' 
gaza 's total dependence 
entire economy gaza strip totally dependent 
israel . 
recent year gaza strip 
increase sub-contracted work israeli 
factory , mostly footware textile . 
thousand 
small workshop , employ average four worker , 
get raw material unfinished product , together 
detailed work instruction , israeli factory . 
rubinstein attribute development fact 
`` average wage gaza strip merely 40 per cent 
west bank , turn stand half 
average wage israel ; besides gazan employer 
pay social security employee . '' 

average wage gaza strip fifth 
israel , profit israeli factory even 
palestinian sub-contractor must vast . 
higher still `` gazan sub-contractor 
provide labor perform home , 
family 's help . 
livelihood ten thousand 
gazan depend sub-contracted work . '' 
many 
woman child , pay ten shekel 
$ 3.50 day last 12 hour . 

doubt profit exploit cheap gazan 
labor one reason stubborn opposition 
rabin israeli minister withdrawal 
strip . 
economic condition gaza strip differ little 
create straight israel 's conquest 
1967 . 
respect , one delude 
talk , nowadays fashionable , israeli gesture 
intend `` encourage economic development 
territory '' , israeli journalist point , permit 
open new business depend prior approval 
shin bet . 
`` behind profess goodwill 
desire solve problem , attitude good 
colonialist , willing something benefit 
native , condition behave nicely , 
become rebellious , never anything 
interest metropolis , economic interest 
include , '' write michal sela davar february . 

development sub-contracted work gaza strip 
accord perfectly sela 's diagnosis . 
sela also show exactly economic control work . 
`` branch economy , lobby set 
motion purpose free israeli production 
threat palestinian competition . 
method 
simplicity . 
soon israeli producer succeed 
persuade government , even trade 
industry minister alone , military order issue 
prohibit export give produce israel . 

suffice , palestinian factory may deny 
licence operate bureaucratic obstacle may paralyse 
production . '' 
among active lobby 
agricultural one . 
succeed limit export 
gazan vegetable except grow settler 
israel also europe , 
otherwise might compete israeli export . 
apartheid 
labor 's goal perpetuate apartheid regime 
territory . 
goal share us , 
otherwise could support labor government 
firmly . 
view one reason us feel 
happier support labor likud 
greater efficiency pursue settlement drive . 

point bring home ofer shelah ma'ariv , 
deplore settler ' failure attribute 
likud 's inefficiency . 
show peak yearly 
settlement growth `` occur term office 
national unity government i.e. 1984-90 
rabin serve throughout defense minister '' . 
likud 's reputation settle territory better 
labor false , attributable many tiny settlement 
without strategic value found shamir 
symbolic reason . 
sum : labor 's policy , unconditionally support 
us differ likud primarily 
efficiency implement . 
accord 
policy territory divide two 
part . 
major part rule israel directly , 
minor part indirectly . 
view , racist 
scheme doom ultimately fail , horrifying 
price human suffering . 
sooner true nature 
recognize , less suffering may cause .
