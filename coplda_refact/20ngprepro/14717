'll either stay trade montreal quebec . 
dunno hat . 
friend genie say 
ottawa 's go soft daigle think hard pronger . 
daigle 
show attitude latter part season many folk ' like , 
come back second suspension 
stupid , really tank performance . 
stock drop like 
rock . 
also remember lot teh `` draft 1st '' stuff come assumption 
'll trade quebec lot prospects . 
clear 
quebec would really willing pay lot give current 
status . 
still first round , consider first pick lock 
means point . 
also possible senator posture try bring 
sign price , since daigle take lindros lesson tho 
suspension .

. 
kariya go first three , simple reason : 
leave college , believe expansion team go 
use first someone around another year two , 
equally good almost good stuff available make 
immediate impact . 
san jose seem lean heavily towards 
niedermayer reason . 
kariya could go 6th 7th , unless team 
convince leave school early doubt . 
cut thing stand today :
