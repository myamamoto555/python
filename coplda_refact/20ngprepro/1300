two shot : 1 check tire - see wear bar , 
problem area tire pass penny test 
bar - guide . 
problem wet call hydroplaning . 
may enough tread leave channel water 
tire - go fishy lift road . 
2 tire age . 
particular , soft tire compound get harder put 
thru heat cycle . 
harder compound grip well 
soft one . 
effect noticable tire get hot 
often , competition , hit tire .
