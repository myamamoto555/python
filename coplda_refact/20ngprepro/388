projectile travel near typical bullet speed potentially 
lethal . 
even blank projectile cause death 
muzzle close proximity victim . 
hear rubber 
plastic bullet use effectively riot situation 
intent crowd control , rather close range self defense ; also 
see report death cause british northern ireland . 
use firearm self defense appropriate lawful 
gravest situation ; point , consider deadly lethal force 
proper reaction law . 
furthermore , use less effective still potentially lethal force 
set problem . 
may well take application 
less effective force stop incident ; place party 
risk ; victim attack stop , 
since aggregate damage multiple application may well 
deadly .
