curiosity speak el pad . 

mostly use backlight lcd 's , point , come 
several different color . 
many emit color `` true '' 
white , one personally encounter 
often . 
vary input requirement , however , tend operate 
100 , much higher 60 hz . 
400 hz 1 khz , 
recall correctly . 
get work 120 , 60 hz i.e. , 
line glow brightly , degrade much faster . 
oh yes , almost forget , el 's tendency wear time ...
