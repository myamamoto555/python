2 simple reason : 
1 batting williams ahead bond create leave clark , 
right williams , leave bond situation middle 
batting order . 
make tougher oppose manager 
change pitcher . 
2 bond batting behind williams mean matt get 
good pitch hit . 
important since struggle 
much break ball . 
opposing pitcher want 
walk williams get bond .
