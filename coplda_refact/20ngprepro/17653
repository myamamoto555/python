feeling baptism : parent baptize baby 
baby sanctify grace baptism thus removal original 
sin soul event unexpected death . 
, parent speak behalf child young 
speak . 
surprise anyone : parent 
always believe best baby ?

apply baby 's physical need spiritual 
need god 's grace ? 
purpose confirmation baby young adult 
decide promise 
parent make baptism . 
accept jesus 
heart come . 
baptism , parent ask jesus come 
baby 's heart ; confirmation child repeat request 
independently . 
way , personal feeling , though believe 
pretty close doctrinal position catholic church 
issue .
