obvious mr. cramer ` ability ' take ` leap faith ' . 
listen several man involve study , even 
claim man involve ` tell whole truth ' . 
put little value extrapolate type ` study ' ` survey ' , 
limit subset individual , alot skewing due 
improper selection method , bias people involve 
study side - subject researcher . 
would admit part group well like ? 
would 
admit sex people consider abnormal 
rate apply heterosexual man . 
fact , one gay man one 
straight man put , `` man lie number partner , 
thing '' - culture male almost require type 
response . 
may seem harmless silly , carry large emotional 
mental price tag . 
hear college male student everyday talk ` suppose ' 
conquest . 
look good one another , least 
eye . 
also know alot go , many college 
male hetero lot sex different partner .
