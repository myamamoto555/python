+ - useful statistic . 
player ice team score 
lot goal allow goal , must something right . 
especially useful compare teammate - play 
team roughly similar + - rating equally 
good player . 
adjust - vary degree success compare 
player different team . 
agree would nice nhl keep statistics - useful 
one suggest ?? 
total ice time would useful - 
miss stat jagr vs francis argument . 
somehow measure 
quality ice time suggest would useless . 
would 
better stat evaluate coaching - ie player give quality ice 
time actually talented one ? 
good player could give low 
amount quality ice time team depth stupid coach 
recognize talent bad player could give lot 
quality ice time lack team depth stupid coach 
think effective player . 
stat would much flawed 
+ - almost conclusion could draw regard player talent . 
+ - useful stat . 
quite useful evaluate player talent . 
one display ignorance unwillingness see 
ice goal score allow 
positive thing - evaluate .
