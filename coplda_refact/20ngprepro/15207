hard brake swerve tend mutually exclusive

apparently instinct brake face danger strong 
instinct freeze nothing face danger . 
hurt 
find surprising number motorcyclist 
use brake prior impact . 
think way 'll ever use reliably correctly 
crisis make conscious method directional control 
ever use , practice constantly , even need 
turn . 
follow long straight , seem 
wiggle back forth randomly suddenly without obvious need , 
practice countersteering avoid imaginary obstacle directly 
path . 
practice may indeed futile , even 
millisecond react , familiar tactic available hopefully 
automatic . 
logic apply brake 
front brake , course .
