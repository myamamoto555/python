two issue : copyright patent . 
magazine article 's contents copyright , may reproduce , 
translate , etc. , without copyright holder 's permission . 
however , 
cover idea express , form expression . 
copying 
circuit diagram pattern copyright infringement . 

unlikely could stretch copyright far enough claim 
circuit design copyright . 
long draw 
diagram lay board , copyright issue . 
patents different . 
author give warning 
design cover patent although would sensible 
. 
fact , possible infringe someone 
else 's patent without realize . 
ignorance patented status 
defense infringement , although might reduce damages 
court would award . 
however ... unless something seriously novel circuit , 
almost certainly `` obvious one skilled art '' therefore 
. 
routine engineering patentable ; patent theory 
cover invention , idea genuinely new . 
caution : lawyer . 
consulting professional would wise 
significant amount money stake .

work one man 's work .
