strongly disagree absolute truth would require interpretation .

like 
many thing , truth always subject misinterpretation . 
strongly suspect reach impasse , 
deign comment much .

hold . 
never say christian arrogant . 
indeed , 
many christian src stress , trap 
christian must always wary .

believe absolute establish bible , necessarily 
arrogant .

say accord stance , reliably 
determine true . 
say . 
say fallible 
human , discern truth 100 % certainty . 

distinction subtle yet important . 
scientist perform experiment , claim result 
reliable , without claim absolutely mistake whatsoever could 
make . 
word , admit could mistaken , 
without sacrifice conviction . 
nobody establish absolute truth 100 % certainty . 
throughout century , philosopher argue know 
complete certainty . 
descartes make step 
right direction utter , `` cogito , ergo sum , '' yet advance 
much beyond . 
believe people aside exist ? 
believe 
computer terminal use exist ? 
, absolutely 
certain ? 
sure grand illusion ? 
course , 
assurance . 
mean , however , 
practical purpose , certain exist . 

christianity . 
mature christian know deep conviction 
absolute morality , yet acknowledge non-zero probability 
wrong . 
, however , mean 
abandon absolute .
