miller convict sawed-off shotgun pay 
nfa '34 tax . 
snatch court 's decision : 
second amendment intend `` assure continuation render 
possible effectiveness force militia ... must 
interpret apply end view . '' 
militia include `` male physically capable act concert 
common defense . '' 
however , regard sawed-off shotgun , `` certainly within 
judicial notice weapon part ordinary military 
equipment use could contribute common defense . '' 
`` judicial notice '' term art -- mean 
evidence formally present . 
different claim 
rule .

gun fall outside scope second . 
useful argument 
unless believe significant gun class gun belong 
class .

maybe 
also agree weapon random state government 
ban try ban `` sport purpose '' 
`` citizen would ever need gun '' fall 
protection second . 
, give damn near gun practical utility 
time use military , even marksmanship 
training purpose , need understand intent press 
point , argue something protect second .
