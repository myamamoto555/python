candidate clinton promise tax rich , folk think 
pretty nifty idea . 
president clinton say want family 
make $ 100,000 bear 70 % new tax burden , many 
quick complain six-figure income make one 
well-to-do . 
particularly ironic 
traditionally liberal enclave bay area academia 
wealthy struggle fit mantle `` 
regular working-class folk '' . 
nobody ever admit rich ; everybody 's middle class .

oh ? 
12-year veteran silicon valley , see precious 
employment ad call phd . 
$ hardly chump change ; 
well median household income state . 
bay area average household income mid - $ 40,000 range . 
national 
average $ . 
bay area nearly twice national average 
six-figure income household 9.1 % vs 4.8 % . 
cost-of-living 
may high , think twice national average ... 
> los angeles , modest home price $ 500,000 . 
tract house bay area working-class neighborhood 
go $ 250,000 . 
doubt los angeles market 
different . 
would appear definition `` modest '' perhaps 
bit immoderate ... 
? 
cheaper gainfully employ . 

> california , $ 65,000 upper-middle-class . 

depend upon definition ; clearly average . 
two-third california household make . 
seem 
belong upper one-third unreasonable 
definition `` upper-middle-class '' . 
note professor 's 
spouse earn $ 35,000 become one clinton 's `` rich '' family . 
breakdown national , california , bay area household income : 
< $ 30k $ $ $ 100k + 

us 49 % 24 % 23 % 4 % census bureau weird 
ca 41 % 26 % 26 % 7 % round ... like 5 % 
ba 34 % 25 % 31 % 9 % 
add little : 
minimum wage earner work 40 make $ 8,840 year . 
poverty 
line family four $ . 
make twice , 
government consider `` work poor '' . 
say decide call 
`` lower-middle-class '' . 
` bout : 
$ annual income `` middle-class '' . 
$ `` upper-middle-class '' . 
$ 100k + `` rich '' . 
$ 1,000 k + `` '' . 
$ 10,000 + `` bill gates '' . 
make sense ?
