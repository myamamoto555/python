oft-quoted line say people guarantee life , liberty 
pursuit happiness inalienable rights , complete lie 
deception , author line process 
prove . 
liberty never free , always purchase cost , 
almost always cost another . 
liberty inalienable ? 
similarly right life . 
one person must die save 
another , even group , life inalienable ? 
lead classic question value death penalty , 
especially serial killer . 
life liberty valuable , 
serial killer , victim ? 
accord beautiful line , 
two rights completely inviolate , , noone 
able remove . 
_ include _ government . 
admittedly serial 
killer restrict people 's life liberty , 
inviolate also ? 
accord declaration independence , 
.

oooh , like . 
mean kill infant murder 
. 
reason , infant . 
similarly people brain dead easier see , coma , etc. . 
also , current law , accidental killing still murder .

think first claim . 

kind `` objective '' morality , example 
murder wrong . 
want claim , 
fine . 
real golden rule life , gold , make 
rule . 
i.e. might make right .

?

think

mean golden rule state , yes , almost every system 
implement use reality . 
sorry , deal much 
fiction , reality . 
way , seem understand difference 
`` arbitrary '' `` objective '' . 
keith schneider `` define '' murder 
, arbitrary . 
jon livesey may 
still say `` well , accord personal system morality , 
killing human murder , wrong , 
legal definition murder may usa , , saudi 
arabia , prc may matter whit '' . 
welcome 
: 
arbitrary ? 
find part society , societal 
rule , moral , etc. arbitrary , please tell . 
think 
.
