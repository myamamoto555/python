regard consequence original sin : 
catholics believe adam primarily lose sin , 
human race , sanctify grace . 
basically 
share divine life . 
take rock make able talk : 
god human sanctify grace similar . 
make one able live plane power 
possible creature . 
`` everlasting life '' new 
testament speak . 
christ come restore life sanctify 
grace human race . 
institute sacraments means 
life give people , increase foster . 
absence sanctify grace death mean automatic exclusion 
heaven . 
nature heaven impossible 
human part without gift sanctify 
grace . 
use example , would like take rock 
attempt hold conversation : rock talk . 
neither 
human live heaven without sanctify grace . 
obviously apply equally well infant adult , since 
soul . 
infant must baptize , therefore , 
enter heaven . 
need form life , 
enter heaven . 
turn around , infant baptism good support evidence 
catholic belief sanctify grace . 
unless baptism cause 
change infant 's soul , particular reason insist 
practice . 
yet infant baptism probably practice 
apostle , certainly part church shortly 
thereafter . 
evidence infant baptism new testament : 1 
cor 1:16 , act 16:15 , 16:33 , , also act 11:14 . 
know 
sure least one disciple apostle john baptize 
infant : st. polycarp remark make act 
martyrdom . 
st. justin martyr mention man woman baptize 
infant . 
direct evidence st. irenaeus 's `` 
heresy '' , tertullian 's `` baptism '' . 
far 
mention first 170 year lord 's death . 

, start ton evidence practice .
