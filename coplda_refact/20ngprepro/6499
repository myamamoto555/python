intelligent people find evidence convincing . 

seem point .

believe christianity true also believe thing contradict 
false . 
suggest model spiritual thing rather different 
christian one . 
sound like existentialist view , 
people choose value follow , actual independent 
spiritual reality , way say specific choice 
unique sense right . 
sort model -- modification 
one sort another -- may appropriate religion . 

christianity `` historical '' religion .

see evidence history . 
`` mundane '' world ,
