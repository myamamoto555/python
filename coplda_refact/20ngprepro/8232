latest israeli `` proposal '' , first propose february 1992 , contain 
follow assumption concern nature `` interim status '' 
refer wb gaza , palestinians , implement negotiation . 
state : 
> israel remain exist source authority `` final status '' 
agree upon ; 
> israel delegation power organ 
interim self-government arrangement isga ; 
> isga apply `` palestinian inhabitant territory '' 
israeli military administration . 
arrangement 
territorial application , apply israeli population 
territory palestinian inhabitant jerusalem ; 
> residual power delegate isga reserve israel ; 
> israelis continue live settle ; 
> israel alone responsibility security aspect - 
external , internal - maintenance public order ; 
> organ isga nature ; 
> exercise power isga subject cooperation 
coordination israel . 
> israel negotiate delegation power responsibility 
area administration , justice , personnel , agriculture , education , 
business , tourism , labor social welfare , local police , 
local transportation communication , municipal affair religious 
affair . 
several question come mind concern `` success '' hope 
ongoing negotiation process . 
arrangement certainly seem 
essentially rejection palestinian `` interim '' self-control . 
without expose unwarranted risk create 
vulnerability , israel reasonably put forward later point 
negotiate process `` relax '' proposal `` interim '' period ? 
proposal either side alter temper 
`` maximalist '' approach state ? 
israeli worry , 
desire `` interim control '' , address provide 
real interim palestinian self-governing entity ?
