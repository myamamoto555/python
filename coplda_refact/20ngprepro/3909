okay , get great response last question thanks , everyone , 
let try : 
tell read-only ? 
want use read-only cell already 
start run cell , use arbitrary 
nearest color match scheme get cell come closest 
request color . 
determine cell read-only , assume request 
exact color specification 
flag ` use ' application later get 
free someone else allocate read-write another 
application . 
far , way figure write 
error handler go ahead request cell color , 
full . 
error cell . 
life would much easier could detect 
stuff directly ... 
idea ?
