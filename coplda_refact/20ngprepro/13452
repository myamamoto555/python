hate belabor obvious , orbiter 
emergency early stage original hst deployment mission , 
would land hst bay . 
indeed worry . 
one concern possibility 
would lose motor something way , make orbit one 
low give hst useful lifetime atmospheric drag . 
believe decision deploy hst even project lifetime 
short six month . 
fact get excellent orbit , upper 
envelope shuttle . 
never hear serious consideration hst might bring 
refurbishment . 
would horrendous cost transporting , 
cleaning , , hardware ground , 
addition lose observe time cost second deployment 
mission risk might get good orbit second 
time . 
, would probably still need third service mission 
year gyro component wear . 
better two 
service mission space could well happen bring hst 
take .
