want achieve overall throughput rate around 5 megabyte sec 
large datum transfer . 
around 5 mb . 
quadra 950 . 
nubus network card pump datum mac memory 8.5 . 
use transfer 
high-speed disk array asynchronous pb call 
achieve 6.8 . 
let 's say transfer go disk buffer network card . 
enough first transfer datum disk buffer , 
transfer datum buffer card . 
6.8 8.5 
result overall 3.8 . 
slow ! 
try follow scheme : transfer , 
step 1 : load 1st mb disk buffer . 
step 2 : send 1st mb card , load 2nd mb disk buffer . 
step 3 : send 2nd mb card , load 3rd mb disk buffer . 
... 
step n : send n-1 mb card , load nth mb disk buffer . 
step n +1 : send nth mb card . 
even though code apparently execute card transfer asynchronously , 
card use mac cpu , use buffer , tho ' 
step 2 n take long two transfer 
execute one another . 
improvement rate . 
? 
mac ram ? 
nubus card disk driver 
access datum time . 
problem two device , card disk driver , use 
bus mac ram ? 
anything ?
