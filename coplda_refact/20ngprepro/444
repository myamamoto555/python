go shoot revolver semi-auto like 
colt .45 . 
one fire faster ? 
nope . 
aside 
faster rate fire usually desirable . 
sure make 
guy duck cover , try hit anything thompson 
. 
military limit m-16 
. 
simple semi-auto would better , troops 
like able rock roll even wasteful ammo something 
often short supply enemy plentiful . 
revolver equally capable semi-auto caliber . 
- revolver also advantage misfire pull 
trigger . 
- double-action revolver almost first , 
fire merely pull trigger . 
- misfire revolver merely mean must pull trigger 
rotate next round . 
- revolver carry 6th chamber empty 
hammer maximum safety , still draw fire 
easy motion , even one handed . 
- revolver allow reload almost fast magazine 
semi-auto . 
faster depend user . 
- misfire semi-auto require clear jam shell 
first , time spend fatal . 
vital second often 
lose realize `` hey , jam ! '' 
start anything 
clear . 
- semi-auto must slide work chamber first round 
cock hammer . 
police carry semi-auto 
chamber loaded hammer cock , safety engage . 
consider 
safe however . 
must trade-off safety get speed 
employment revolver . 
- double-action semi-auto , complexity 
operation many require training . 
police department switch glocks , start quietly 
switch many officer back old revolver . 
many 
accident , partly due poor training receive . 
glocks 
require rocket scientist , cop baffle something complex 
timer vcr . 
anyone go anyone say criminal obviously outgun 
police know nothing firearm . 
turn cop hunter 
pay attention . 
seek say `` semi-auto junk '' 
merely assume better job stupid . 
cop 
revolver hip shotgun rack 
equip anything short riot . 
gun control hit aim . 
whip 
fire real fast may find hit anything . 
good controlled fire revolver likely get hit . 
9mm beretta consider inferior carry weapon 
something like ruger security six revolver . 
hit 
aim first 5 shot , something quite seriously 
wrong somewhere . 
might like backup capacity 
extra shot certain case , overwhelmingly # shot fire 
criminal encounter less 5 . 
crook overwhelmingly use crime ? 
nice simple 
.38 revolver police often use . 
well actually police 
prefer much heftier .357 magnum , anyway ... 
: flame , prefer semi-auto thing . 

introduce unneccessary complication something nerve-wracking 
abrupt encounter lone criminal .
