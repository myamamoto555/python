thanks good idea look use 
couple idea . 
recieve mail today spec sheet mil . 
spec version 's chip . 
stable -50 c 
suck little power . 
show application time 
delay several year depend rc time constant . 

application , two cascade together . 
reset trigger 
pin chip tie together second chip 
disabled . 
configuration , output high system reset . 
trigger , output go low stay way total 65,536 x 
timing cycle first chip . 
total timing cycle two chip 
program 256 x r x c 65,536 x r x c 256 step select 
combination counter output timer output . 
beauty 
, chip would timing cap 
resistor 39.1 seconds per timing cycle . 
get maximum 
seconds timing cycle 39.1 x 65,536 29 day ! 
course , much need 14 day . 
counter allow 
256 binary step select output ` pellet ' . 
first 14 day trip , would reset self next 14 
day timing cycle forth . 
power still problem though . 
idea suggest bury 
electronics hole dig snow insulator put pellet 
tower estimate snow fall solar panel 
keep charge lithium battery pack . 
like idea thing 
work least six week three sample gas valve 12 volt 
spit pellet onto snow . 
anyway , order 's see 
. 
interesting long one 
go digging pellet middle antartica freezing bun

thanks everyone ...
