might interesting folk know church scotland 
also presbyterian church manage `` agree disagree '' 
woman 's ordination 25 year . 
reasoning congregation 
free call whoever wish , ministers sessions 
choose elder . 
congregation wish woman , 
oblige , session wish , could 
force . 
note issue freedom call part 
congregation important - year 150th 
disruption , church split 
issue , get back together almost 80 year . 
couple year ago 25 anniversary allow women 
ordination position change - , theory , 
minister elder must recognize woman ordain . 

theory , minister refuse ordain woman session , 
refuse work woman minister presbytery , could 
discipline . 
practice happen , believe 
unlikely happen . 
personal view new legislation 
mistake , permissive prescriptive legislation 
work well . 
go start go round homosexual debate next year 
assembly . 
year , motion put ban blessing 
same-sex couple edinburgh minister . 
panel 
doctrine currently look marriage , report next year - 
matter consider debate . 
hope interesting
