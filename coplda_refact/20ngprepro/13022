norman green claim lose money last three year 
team . 
buy team , seem kind 
obvious go deal year red , 
team start make profit . 
give impression 
willing . 
claim two year ago team 
need average 8000 + fan per game order pull profit , 
season team average 12000 + fan , despite ticket 
price . 
think team 's attendence play clearly upward 
trend , leave dumbfounded could ignore 
decide move . 
even offer many concession rudely 
demand , guarantee season ticket sale , cheap rent 
two arena town , etc. . 
oh well , guess bottom line $ $ $ . 
green want immediate huge 
return dallas , willing wait another year mn . 
dallas give green pretty stellar deal play although feel 
minnesota 's quite reasonable , also crony 
well . 
mean , minnesota without nhl team 
year two . 
bad nhl .
