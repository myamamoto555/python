home : ~ pioneering study residential gunshot death king 
county , washington , find gun home 43 time 
likely use kill owner , spouse , friend child 
kill intruder . 
~ ~ 43 time ~ stat everywhere day ; 
grow media lore like proverbial urban myth : inflate 
one pugilistic talk-show pundit ~ 93 . 
~ give shock value 
finding , conclusion 1986 new england journal medicine 
nejm study remarkably understate : ~ advisability keep 
firearm home protection must question . 
~ 
responsible people indeed question risk benefit 
bring firearm home . 
need know : 
exactly risk benefit ? 
nejm testimony neither 
whole truth benefit nothing truth 
risk . 
, motor vehicle , want know : control 
risk benefit ? 
, risk 
cancer heart disease auto accident : minimize 
risk ? 
like raw highway death toll , nejm stat helpful 
. 
nejm finding purport inform , frame warn 
. 
widely promulgate media ~ scare stat , ~ 
misleading whose formulation calculate prejudice 
terrify . 
frightful statistic scream : risk far 
outweigh benefit , yes ? 
fool would run risk ? 

car 43 time likely kill , loved one , dear friend 
innocent child get destination , 
take bus ? 
uncritical citation put good name statistics bad company 
lie damned lie . 
surely , better life 
stake . 
let ~ take closer look risky business : 
~ 43 time ~ stat nejm study product divide 
number home justifiably kill self-defense 
divisor number family member acquaintance kill 
gun home dividend . 
divisor risk equation 
9 : study ~ five-year sample 2 intruder 7 
case self-defense . 
dividend 387 : study 12 
accidental death , 42 criminal homicide , 333 suicide . 
387 divide 
9 yield 43 . 
total 743 death king 
county 1978 1983 , study leave 347 death outside 
home unaccounted . 
nejm ~ notorious ~ 43 time ~ statistic seriously misleading 
six count : 
1 . 
dividend misleadingly characterize media : ~ 
acquaintance ~ study include friendly drug dealer 
neighborhood gang member equate ~ friend . 
~ implication 
offend gun target kill beloved family member , 
dear friend , innocent child . 
death may equally tragic , 
character circumstance victim killer 
relevant risk . 
crucial risk factor mask 
calculate impression death toll generate witless 
walton shoot dear friend friendly neighbor . 

criminological hogwash . 
2 . 
study distinguish household environs 
populate people violent , criminal , history 
-- risk death high -- versus household inhabit 
civil folk example , people avoid high-risk activity 
like drug dealing , gang banging wife beating -- risk 
low indeed . 
actuality , negligent adult allow fatal 
avoidable accident ; homicide perpetrate mostly people 
history violence abuse , people identifiably 
certifiably ~ high risk ~ misadventure . 
ignore obvious 
risk factor firearm accident homicide mislead 
ignore role alcohol vehicular death : tautology , neither 
gun death vehicular death would occur without firearm 
vehicle ; person circumstance gun owner driver 
crucially affect risk . 
3 . 
one misleading implication way nejm stat frame 
mere presence gun home much likely kill 
protect , obscure -- indeed , disregard -- role 
personal responsibility . 
typical quotation study unlike 
larson ~ attribute fatal agency gun : ~ gun home 43 
time likely kill ... ~ center prevent handgun 
violence , major nejm statistic , use 
particular formulation . 
dispense silly debate 
whether ~ people gun accomplish killing : , 
tautology , gun death would occur without gun . 
question 
beg many death would occur anyway , without gun . 

case , people agent , gun lethal 
instrument . 
moral core personal risk factor gun death 
personal responsibility choice . 
due care responsibility 
obviate gun accident ; human choice mediate homicide suicide 
gun otherwise . 
choice gun need condemn person 
nejm ~ high-risk pool . 
gun create risk . 
people lot say risk run gun 
home . 
example , graduate paxton quigley ~ personal protection 
course run tout ~ 43 time ~ risk skilled 
sober driver run risk cause suffer vehicular death 
reckless drunk driver . 
undiscriminating actuarial disregard 
obscure role personal responsibility choice , 
disregard obscure role socio-economic , criminological 
factor death . 

resent insurance premium actuarial risk pool whose 
norm disregard individuality . 
fortunately , nothing consign 
nejm risk pool lack choice responsibility 
matter . 
4 . 
suicide account 84 % death gun home 
nejm study . 
total death gun king county , 
include outside home , in-house suicide 44 % total 
death toll , closer roughly 50 % proportion find 
study . 
suicide social problem different order 
homicide accident . 
implication nejm study 
suicide might occur without readily available gun . 
true 
attempt suicide gun likely succeed . 
obviously 
true absence gun would prevent 
suicide . 
widely assume allege , preponderance 
research gun suicide actually show otherwise , 
wishful thinking truly impulsive case . 
see : bruce 
l. danto et al. , human side homicide , columbia university press , 
1982 ; charles rich et al. , ~ gun suicide , ~ american journal 
psychiatry , march 1990 . 
suicide remove dividend 
nejm study ~ risk equation , ~ 43 time ~ stat would deflate 
~ six . 
~ inclusion suicide nejm risk equation -- like 
cause , durability , interdiction suicidal intent -- 
profoundly debatable matter . 
quotation nejm study totally 
disregard issue . 
5 . 
citation nejm study also mislead regard estimable 
rate justifiable excusable homicide . 
measure , like 
nejm homicide rate , base immediate disposition case . 
many homicide initially rule criminal appeal later rule 
self-defense . 
literature battered woman , immediate case 
disposition notorious rate 
justifiable excusable homicide . 
time ~ january 18 , 1993 , cover story 
woman ~ fighting back ~ report one study ~ find 40 % woman 
appeal murder conviction throw . 
time ~ july 17 , 
1989 , cover story week gun death report 51 % domestic 
case shooting abuse victim ; 3 % homicide 
report self-defense . 
may 14 , 1990 , update , time report 
12 % homicide eventually rule self-defense . 

time ~ sample , originally report rate self-defense error 
factor four . 
possibility error acknowledge 
nejm statistic . 
6 . 
dividend product nejm risk equation 
arguably inflate , divisor unconscionably misleading . 

divisor equation count aggressor kill , 
aggressor successfully thwart without kill even 
shot . 
utility armed self-defense side 
coin harm gun home . 
kind moral idiocy 
measure utility term killing ? 
measure 
utility police solely term felon kill -- 
oppose many many otherwise foiled , apprehend , 
deter ? 
celebrate let alone count case 
human life lose successful armed ? 
question pose 
media cite nejm scare stat : neglect 
compendious research successful armed defense , notably 
criminologist gary kleck point blank : gun violence america , 
aldine de gruyter , 1992 ? 
kleck ~ estimation rate risk defensive firearm use 
base victimization survey well study : rate 
high one million year risk good gun defender fare 
better anyone , either resort form resistance 
resist . 
divide one million gun year 
30,000 annual gun death self-defense , homicide , suicide , 
accident yield 33 . 
thus , construct much favorable 
statistic nejm scare stat : 
gun 33 time likely use defend assault 
crime kill anybody . 
course , kleck ~ critic belittle dividend calculation ; 
good news gun defender bad news gun control . 

indeed question basis method kleck ~ high estimation 
defensive firearm use , question nejm statistic . 
clearly , issue manage mortal risk settle 
uncritical citation statistics . 
one thing trouble still : 
hardly escape unquestioned nejm scare stat media , 
hardly ever find kleck ~ good work mention , even critically .
