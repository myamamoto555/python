anatole france say ; `` law impartial majesty forbid 
rich well poor sleep bridge . '' 
equality law construe number way . 
example 
fact property theft , regardless value , 
punish equally inequality protect 
lot money steal . 
could easily define 
equality regard property term significance 
owner . 
would form equality would skewed 
toward poorer people . 
fact , anti-gay bash law construct offer equal 
protection . 
make offense damage people base 
motivation hatred sexual orientation . 
thus law 
impartial majesty protect het well gay bash . 
sure great relief douglas meier .
