seem one suppose reading . 
think 
major difference opinion legitimacy sevres . 
first , sign ottoman empire therefore legally bind 
republic turkey . 
new independence movement way , young turks naturally reject hand . 
say 
accept germans absurd . 
see harsh treaty hitler . 
second , sevres treaty even 
worse versailles . 
divide ottoman empire several influence 
zone , capital occupy , economy allied control , army di 
minish nothing police force , short country name . 
would 
wonder would like live condition . 
record , feel sorry soldier kill izmir harbor . 
evacuate 
city , greek force burn , serve right . 
fool allied promise , fault . 
come anatolia enforce sevres take part plunder well .
