actually , think large-scale sample size part problem . 
seem plot player baseball 
regard ba vs. clutch ba deviation would get kind 
bell curve . 
x-axis + - deviation clutch hit 
vs. ; y-axis number player . 
certainly 
would player extreme end bell . 

supposition find player consistently 
year year one end bell , might 
able make reasonable conclusion player 
oppose baseball player .

hear kind accusation . 
interesting 
select maldonado , someone also 
look . 
inconsistent hitter term ba , 
hit 1989 - 92 .217 , .273 , .250 , .272 admittedly , 
trade league well club . 
clutch hit 
record equally inconsistent . 
, purpose 1993 would 
draw conclusion ability hit clutch base 
prior performance . 
know would feel 1988 , 
may indeed right . 
look sabo find consistent record hit , 
consistent pattern clutch hit proportionately 
ba . 
ditto joe carter . 
probably bring heart disagreement 
topic . 
must conclusion base statistical 
history able apply broadly throughout datum base 
validity ? 
impossible irrational apply 
statistical analysis select component datum base ?

completely accept reasoning . 
, find 
individual end spectrum consistent 
basis ?

correct say predict
