well , would say mostly right , different reason . 
btw , 
couple year ago , steal bike orange county sf 750 
gsx 's ninjas . 
probably biggest reason bmw rip 
people buy bmw deal actual bmw dealer , mail - 
order type . 
inventory check fairly easily 
law-enforcement type , mark-up usually sufficient keep 
honest acquire part . 
harley , get 2 different situation . 

huge aftermarket harley part , bike part fairly easily . 
ditto non-sport japanese bike , price part 
high , comparatively . 
` rocket ' , anytime bike go , 
plastic usually crack , expensive replace . 
fairly easy , 
, disreputable shop take fairing steal bike , slap 
bike repair , repaint , make tidy profit . 
part , 
traceable , use , discard traceable .
