jim , 
couple thing post thread 
little confusing . 
atheist one thing 
understand process nature - exclusively . 
need 
recourse describe explain anything . 

purpose direction event beyond require 
physics , chemistry , biology , etc. ; everything random , nothing 
. 
would also include human intelligence course 
product . 
nothing require life evolve 
acquire intelligence , happy accident . 
atheist , 
event prefer another say less 
value another naturalistic sense , thought - - 
event value . 
product intelligence acquire environment , 
teaching , training , observation experience 
significant individual mind wherein reside . 
mental 
process image produce electrical 
activity nothing ; content consequence . 
human 
mind much response natural force water run 
hill . 
atheist judge value ? 
basis criticize 
value bible purpose imputed god ? 

grounds behavior condemn ? 

seem , judge value motivate action , 
standard conduct measure , 
nature serve purpose ? 
law nature invoke 
establish value . 
since every event entirely exclusively physical event , 
difference could possibly make - anyone - , religious 
otherwise , - meaning - gradation value . 

way atheist object - - behavior admit 
objection entirely subjective like 
- . 
value judgement must preface disclaimer 
nothing matter personal opinion carry 
weight `` absolute '' sense . 
like god tell people say nothing god 
god 's command , say electrical event 
nervous system create emotional state mind couple 
pre-existing form reaction . 

objection - seem - well found due way 
condition ; `` truth '' content . 
whole 
intellectual landscape illusion , virtual reality . 
make rule , inherent naturalistic atheism 
consistent , accept human 
thought , even . 
, exclude 
discussion value , right , wrong , , evil , 
etc. participate . 
opinion bible 
weight whatsoever .
