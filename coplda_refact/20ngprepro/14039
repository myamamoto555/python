subject : painting increase resolution 
lines : 40 
people work cube come need , 
seem someone might already , 
point tool would help . 
would like : 
give window take long time draw either 
datum arrive slow link , $ display across slow 
link , would like first paint low-resolution version 
picture , repaint higher resolution . 
thus , picture 
might first generate resolution , 4x4 square 
pixel fill single color . 
next , 4x4 square 
would replace 4 2x2 square ; finally 1x1 version would 
paint . 
since one scenario window side 
slow link , version obviously would transmit 
bitmap ; would help . 
instead , would 
process far end receive picture 
small bitmap , blow pixel square sorta like 
magnifier program . 
bring question whether x 
server help . 
, window open , way 
ask `` filter '' program run process pixel ? 

way use something like rsh start remote process 
`` permission deny '' , open local window ? 
seem likely scenario library routine start 
program remotely , accept bitmap , compress 
one amount , send remote program expand . 
something x help , nice 
hear . 
look several fm , , 
obviously know keyword . 
someone nifty tool 
available package , might want get copy . 
oh , yes ; run suns . 
part idea build 
demo show thing `` run across , say , 
link , fast picture would appear . '' 

customer would get feel speed need pay . 
-- 
auto industry like computer industry , car would 
cost $ 5 , would get 5000 mile gallon , random time would 
explode , kill passenger .
