glad see idea come something similar mind . 
authorization key compute name address 
datum . 
user register , even need send executable code , 
compute key send instruction enter 
appropriate place following : 
name joe doe 
address 123 main street 
city anytown , ca 
key 
every user need unique key . 
executable propagate much 
like , author respond registration e-mail , post card , 
whatever . 
unauthorized user would put someone else 's name 
show maybe main menu screen well startup message . 
authorize user make many copy like , upgrade 
machine , whatever . 
main motivation guilt irritation 
see someone `` registered owner '' .
