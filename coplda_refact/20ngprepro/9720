joe torre , 
go talk bucky game one . 

get lankford third todd zeile believe - hot hitter - 
come - reason risk give lankford go sign 
situation unless sure ball go stand . 
job watch play develop - know larkin 
back bad throw . 
seem inexcusable book . 
btw , see dent thing last year zeile round third 
go sure home critical situation . 

replay , dent wave around . 
look like might 
serious problem . 
card 's good base runner last year 
wonder much fault lie base coaching .
