_ _ know ibm system , , particular , 
absolutely problem -- never `` random '' crash 
run program . 
fact , remember 
_ ever _ crash . 
course , really run program , bunch 
dos windows stuff always run . 
system running 
, one crash , consistent . 
ftp 
tendency crash whenever would get large file > 1mb 
particularly fast client dtr 's sec , figure 
problem 's write buffer -- turn write 
buffer , everything would work fine . 
ftp never lock , though . 
even format floppy

yeah , guess willing admit somewhat sensitive 
specific hardware . 
dos work perfectly fine ...

well , save personal file floppy , 
windows , floppy save large file hang system . 
also find quite bothersome continually tweak 
task option whenever want fractal 
computation background . 
able address memory better dos , 
> sure mean . 
idea 's dos session see memory windows 
dos session . 
let xpl shareware calculus program see around 
free _ conventional _ memory , let bigger symbolic 
manipulation possible straight would see 
around conventional ram . 
. 
also find really handy 
_ _ dos-based program , , without re-writing , could 
handle larger datum set , simulate iteration , etc. . 
course , 
point moot , since program write simply 
_ never _ run memory limitation . 
never program windows , 
much comparison , though ...
