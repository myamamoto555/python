sirtf still much business 
mark whalen 
time nasa budget , 
survival number mission uncertain . 
thanks 
major design refinement implement recent month , jpl 's 
space infrared telescope facility sirtf -- major project 
consider trouble couple year ago -- `` alive 
well , '' accord project scientist michael werner . 
lighter spacecraft , revise orbit shorter mission 
add less expensive project `` tremendous scientific 
power '' bright future , say werner . 
design follow-up highly successful infrared 
astronomical satellite iras cosmic background explorer 
cobe mission , sirtf -- cryogenically cool observatory 
astronomy space -- schedule launch 2000 
2001 plan proceed schedule . 
ira ' pioneering work space-based infrared astronomy 10 
year ago allow astronomer view milky way never 
reveal , among thing , 60,000 galaxy 25 
comet . 
provide sky survey 1,000 time sensitive 
previously available ground-based observation . 
cobe 
measure infrared microwave background radiation large 
angular scale , reveal new fact early universe . 
illuminate sirtf 's potential , jim evans , jpl 's 
manager astrophysics fundamental physics , 
recently say project `` 1,000 1 million time 
capable ira , '' base technological advance 
detector array . 
however , despite enormous stride 
exploration sirtf promise , fact cite 
highest priority new initiative astronomy 1990 
national academy sciences , take `` diet die '' 
directive nasa headquarters last year keep project 
go , accord werner . 
project know atlas sirtf , base key 
factor new design : satellite orbit sun 
instead earth , permit use atlas rocket 
launch instead formerly propose heavier titan . 
`` 
main advantage solar orbit use 
launch capability boost payload -- 
carry second rocket orbit , '' werner say . 
advantage solar orbit , say , `` 
better thermal environment , away heat earth . '' 
additional major change sirtf 's redesign include 
shorten mission five three year build 
spacecraft less half heavy original 
plan -- atlas sirtf weigh 2,470 kilogram 5,400 pound 
compare titan sirtf 's 5,500 kilogram 12,100 pound . 
add `` less stressful launch 
environment , '' werner say , cost savings $ 200 
million launch , addition increase savings 
design smaller , less massive spacecraft . 
werner say sirtf 's redesign come result congress ' 
tell nasa `` try many thing . 
want 
support sirtf , good project , develop plan see 
fit nasa 's overall strategy . '' 
shortly thereafter , sirtf name nasa 's highest 
priority `` flagship '' scientific mission interdisciplinary 
space sciences advisory committee , addition blessing 
national academy sciences . 
spacecraft instrument require 
keep project alive , sirtf 's major scientific contribution 
always promise come advanced infrared detector 
array , allow image develop `` ten 
thousand time faster '' , accord evans . 
`` couple year ago , '' werner say , `` 
astronomy single detector -- small array 
individually assemble detector . 
since , department 
defense develop program produce array ten 
hundred thousand detector , rather , 
well suit use sirtf . '' 
werner note addition deal budget 
pressure , congress currently watch nasa project 
eye `` technological spinoff . '' 
`` question , think thing say , '' 
say , `` detector use straight various 
military development . 
also , sirtf build u.s. 
aerospace industry , real technological engineering 
challenge addition tremendous scientific project . 
`` sirtf use entire astronomical community , '' 
werner add , revise three-year mission `` put premium 
observe time . 
educate user community 
develop program involve early survey quick 
turnaround datum . '' 
werner say downsizing project require 
reduction scope complexity sirtf 's three instrument -- 
infrared spectrograph , infrared array camera multiband 
imaging photometer . 
however , reduction result 
loss efficiency rather capability , say . 
project hope start `` phase b '' activity 1995 , 
provide detailed concept development design . 
build hardware would begin two year later . 
project cost estimate , evans say , $ 850 million - $ 950 
million . 
`` optimistic sirtf , '' say . 
`` 
provide tremendous return investment . '' 
werner add additional benefit project 
`` enrichment intellectual cultural 
environment . 
people street interested 
astronomy ... black hole , possibility life 
planet , origin universe ... kind 
question sirtf help answer . ''
