board intelligent ? 
i.e. , run microcontrollers ? 

easiest thing would another line say one 
board talk pc . 
line true , board 
could hold send datum . 
perfect solution , 
though , since worry little make sure two board 
decide talk _ exact time _ . 
, think need hook board `` something '' 
speak rs-232 . 
actually hard expensive ! 

use , though . 
assume board talk relatively slowly 9600 bp 
slower , pic coordinate thing multiplex 
datum . 
really add suggestion first 
paragraph system . 
assume board talk 
time , long , since pic go 
able buffer , maybe 20-some byte ! 
might want check price card pc , 
though . 
recently buy boca research 2x4 card 2 parallel port , 4 
rs-232 port reasonable $ 85 .
