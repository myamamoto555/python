strike fable lucifer 's 
fall - , way , seem recall speculation 
base biblical text , ex may show -

free `` choose '' evil . 
choice come 
? 
know genesis eve offer opportunity sin 
tempter many assume satan , lucifer discover , 
invent , create , call action , something god 
give origin ? 
also , bible mention lucifer 's free ? 
make big fuss mankind free , strike 
after-the-fact rationalisation , fact , like 
salvation , one christian believe identically .
