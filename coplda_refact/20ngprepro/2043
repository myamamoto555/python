thanks . 
yes . 
use purpose rest assure 
work fine . 
one case route bit serial digital audio use 
difficult see signal degradation surprise give 
pretty fast edge . 
spec would something like -3 db @ 
50 ohm . 
complex type generally little slower 
resistive . 
plain 4000 series good handle 5v logic . 
remember output load see input device .
