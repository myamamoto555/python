dislike phrase `` hate sin , love sinner '' . 
maybe 
definite article also part problem , since seem give 
license fixate brother 's peculiar 
manage escape common grace heredity , economic situation , 
culture . 
outrage evil often cheap shot . 
say , think scott adequately explore flip side 
coin , namely love righteousness . 
beatitudes , 
jesus bless hunger thirst righteousness . 

new testament , never enough behave well , one 
always actively desire work cause good . 
sense , 
impossible remain dispassionate evil 
victim , even accomplice well . 
maybe `` mourn sin , love sinner '' catch idea slightly better 
`` hate '' , slightly , since grief usually imply passive 
powerless position . 
balanced christian response need grief , love , 
carefully measure , constructive anger . 
jesus three . 

european pietist wwii whose response nazi atrocity 
devoid anger fare well role model , however much love 
grief exemplify .

aids , impoverish medical bill , estrange family , 
abandon survive friend .

grief 
jack 's death , sister find quite target anger : callous 
bureaucracy , rigid moralism jack 's family , 
inertia christian ' response aids , , yes , even jack 's 
lapse morality eventually cost life . 
jack

innate sexual orientation , n.b. 
maybe hardest job make anger constructive .
