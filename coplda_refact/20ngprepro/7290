construct logical argument 
although much argument usenet , general quality argument 
find poor . 
article attempt provide gentle introduction 
logic , hope improve general level debate . 
logic science reasoning , proof , think , inference concise 
oed . 
logic allow analyze piece reasoning determine whether 
correct valid invalid . 
course , one need 
study logic order reason correctly ; nevertheless , little basic 
knowledge logic often helpful construct analyze 
argument . 
note claim make whether logic universally 
applicable . 
matter much open debate . 
document merely 
explain use logic , give already decide logic 
right tool job . 
proposition statement building block logical argument . 

proposition statement either true false ; example , `` 
rain '' `` today tuesday '' . 
proposition may either assert say 
true deny say false . 
note technical meaning 
`` deny '' , everyday meaning . 
proposition meaning statement , particular 
arrangement word use express . 
`` god exist '' `` exist 
god '' express proposition . 
argument , quote monty python sketch , `` connected series 
statement establish definite proposition '' . 
argument consist 
three stage . 
first , proposition necessary argument 
continue state . 
call premise argument . 

evidence reason accept argument conclusion . 
premise assertion often indicate phrase `` '' , 
`` since '' , `` obviously '' . 
phrase `` obviously '' often view 
suspicion , use intimidate accept suspicious 
premise . 
something seem obvious , afraid 
question . 
always say `` oh , yes , right , obvious '' 
hear explanation . 
next , premise use derive proposition process know 
inference . 
inference , one proposition arrive basis 
one proposition already accept . 
various form 
valid inference . 
proposition arrive inference may use 
inference . 
inference often denote phrase `` imply '' 
`` therefore '' . 
finally , arrive conclusion argument -- proposition 
affirm basis premise inference . 
conclusion often 
indicate phrase `` therefore '' , `` follow '' , `` conclude '' 
. 
conclusion often state final stage inference . 
example : 
every event cause premise 
universe beginning premise 
beginning involve event premise 
imply beginning universe involve event inference 
therefore universe cause inference conclusion 
note conclusion one argument might premise another 
argument . 
proposition call premise conclusion 
respect particular argument ; term make sense isolation . 
sometimes argument follow order give ; example , 
conclusion might state first premise state 
afterwards support conclusion . 
perfectly valid , 
sometimes little confusing . 
recognize argument much harder recognize premise 
conclusion . 
many people shower writing assertion without ever 
produce anything one might reasonably describe argument . 

statement look like argument , . 
example : 
`` bible accurate , jesus must either insane , evil liar , 
son god . '' 
argument , conditional statement . 
assert 
premise necessary support appear 
conclusion . 
also suffer number logical flaw , ` ll 
come later . 
another example : 
`` god create ; therefore duty god . '' 
phrase `` duty god '' proposition , since neither 
true false . 
therefore conclusion , sentence 
argument . 
finally , causality important . 
consider statement form `` 
b '' . 
interested establish b offer evidence , 
statement argument . 
try establish truth b , 
argument , explanation . 
example : 
`` must something wrong engine car , 
start . '' 
-- argument . 
`` car start something wrong engine . '' 
-- explanation . 
two traditional type argument , deductive inductive . 

deductive argument one provide conclusive proof conclusion 
-- , argument premise true , conclusion must 
also true . 
deductive argument either valid invalid . 
valid 
argument define one premise true , 
conclusion true . 
inductive argument one premise provide evidence 
truth conclusion . 
inductive argument valid invalid ; 
however , talk whether better worse 
argument , probable premise . 
form argument ordinary language neither deductive 
inductive . 
however , concentrate moment deductive 
argument , often view rigorous convincing . 
important note fact deductive argument valid 
imply conclusion hold . 
slightly 
counter-intuitive nature implication , must consider 
carefully . 
obviously valid argument consist true proposition . 
however , 
argument may entirely valid even contain false proposition . 
example : 
insect wing premise 
woodlice insect premise 
therefore woodlouse wing conclusion 
, conclusion true argument 's premise false . 
argument 's premise true , however , conclusion would true . 
argument thus entirely valid . 
subtly , reach true conclusion one false premise , 
: 
fish live sea premise 
dolphins fish premise 
therefore dolphin live sea conclusion 
however , one thing reach false conclusion valid 
inference true premise . 
therefore draw `` truth table '' 
implication . 
symbol '' > '' denote implication ; `` '' premise , `` b '' conclusion . 
`` '' `` f '' represent true false respectively . 
premise conclusion inference 
b > b 
---------------------------- 
f f premise false inference 
f valid , conclusion true false . 
f f premise true conclusion 
false , inference must invalid . 
premise true inference valid , 
conclusion must true . 
sound argument valid argument whose premise true . 
sound 
argument therefore arrive true conclusion . 
careful confuse 
valid argument sound argument . 
delve structure logical argument would require 
lengthy discussion linguistics philosophy . 
simpler probably 
useful summarize major pitfall avoid construct 
argument . 
pitfall know fallacy . 
everyday english term `` fallacy '' use refer mistaken belief 
well faulty reasoning lead belief . 
fair 
enough , logic term generally use refer form 
technically incorrect argument , especially argument appear valid 
convincing . 
purpose discussion , define fallacy logical 
argument appear correct , see incorrect 
examine closely . 
study fallacy aim avoid 
mislead . 
follow list fallacy intend 
exhaustive . 
argumentum ad baculum appeal force 
appeal force commit resort force 
threat force order try push acceptance conclusion .

force threaten need direct threat . 
example : 
'' ... thus ample proof truth bible . 

refuse accept truth burn hell . '' 
argumentum ad hominem 
argumentum ad hominem literally `` argument direct man '' .

practice communists murderer . '' 
sometimes court law doubt cast upon testimony witness 
show , example , known perjurer . 
valid way 
reduce credibility testimony give witness , 
argumentum ad hominem ; however , demonstrate witness 's 
testimony false . 
conclude otherwise fall victim 
argumentum ad see elsewhere list . 
circumstantial form argumentum ad hominem commit person 
argue opponent ought accept truth assertion 
opponent 's particular circumstance . 
example : 
`` perfectly acceptable kill animal food .

example : 
`` course bible true . 
nobody prove otherwise . '' 
`` course telepathy psychic phenomenon exist . 
nobody 
show proof real . '' 
note fallacy apply court law , one 
generally assume innocent proven guilty . 
also , scientific investigation know event would produce 
certain evidence occur , absence evidence 
validly use infer event occur . 
example : 
`` flood describe bible would require enormous volume water 
present earth . 
earth tenth much water , 
even count freeze ice pole . 
therefore 
flood occur . '' 
science , validly assume lack evidence something 
occur . 
conclude certainty occur , 
however . 
argumentum ad 
appeal pity , also know special pleading . 
fallacy 
commit appeal pity sake get 
conclusion accept . 
example : 
`` murder mother father axe . 
please find 
guilty ; suffer enough orphan . '' 
argumentum ad populum

`` bible must true . 
million people know . 
try 
tell mistaken fool ? '' 
argumentum ad 
fallacy closely related argumentum ad populum . 
consist 
assert people support believe proposition , 
likely proposition correct . 
argumentum ad 
appeal authority use admiration famous try win 
support assertion . 
example : 
`` isaac newton genius believe god . '' 
line argument always completely bogus ; example , reference 
admit authority particular field may relevant 
discussion subject . 
example , distinguish quite clearly 
: 
`` stephen hawking conclude black hole give radiation '' 

`` john searle conclude impossible build intelligent 
computer '' 
hawk physicist , reasonably expect opinion black 
hole radiation inform . 
searle linguist , questionable 
whether well-qualified speak subject machine intelligence . 
fallacy accident 
fallacy accident commit general rule apply 
particular case whose `` accidental '' circumstance mean rule 
inapplicable .

example : 
`` christian generally dislike atheist . 
christian , must 
dislike atheist . '' 
fallacy often commit moralist legalist try decide 
every moral legal question mechanically apply general rule .

`` soviet union collapse take atheism . 
therefore must avoid 
atheism reason . '' 
cum hoc ergo propter hoc 
fallacy similar post hoc ergo propter hoc . 
assert 
two event occur together , must causally related , leave 
room factor may cause event . 

fallacy occur premise least questionable 
conclusion reach . 

fallacy occur one assume premise conclusion one 
wish reach . 
often , proposition rephrase 
fallacy appear valid argument . 
example : 
`` homosexual must allow hold government office . 
hence 
government official reveal homosexual lose job . 
therefore homosexual anything hide secret , open 
blackmail . 
therefore homosexual allow hold government

argument like actually cite reason 
british secret services ' official ban homosexual employee . 
another example classic :

fallacy composition conclude property number 
individual item share collection item . 
example : 
`` car use less petrol cause less pollution bus . 
therefore car

true '' . 
understand fallacy , examine truth table 
implication give earlier . 
denial antecedent 
fallacy argument form `` imply b , false , therefore b 
false '' . 
, truth table implication make clear 
fallacy . 
note fallacy different non causa pro causa ; latter 
form `` imply b , false , therefore b false '' , 
fact imply b . 
, problem implication 
invalid ; rather falseness allow deduce 
anything b. 
convert conditional 
fallacy argument form `` b , therefore b '' . 
argumentum ad 
fallacy assert something right good simply

alternative exist exist . 
many questions 
fallacy occur questioner demand simple answer complex 
question . 
non sequitur 
non-sequitur argument conclusion draw premise 
logically connect . 
red herring 
fallacy commit irrelevant material introduce issue 
discuss , everyone 's attention divert away 
point make , towards different conclusion . 
reification
