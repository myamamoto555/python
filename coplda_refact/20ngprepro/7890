would tend call offensive contribution even , alomar win hand 
defensive capability . 
talk number 
error ; nobody include lind ! 
range athleticism second base . 
recall recent past anyone turn double play better 
alomar . 
> well , look stats ? 
baerga may best defensive 
> second baseman league , damn good . 
check stats dp 
> last year see . 
accord defensive average stats post sherri , baerga 
highest percentage dp turn league , alomar worst . 
however , alomar higher defensive average . 
would better ? 
use alomar 's opportunity 469 groundball , 73 possible double play 
alomar 332 groundout turn 18 dp . 
baerga would da & dp % 328 groundout 35 dp . 
use baerga 's 545 groundball , 99 possible double play . 
alomar would da & dp % 386 groundout 25 dp . 
baerga 381 groundout 47 dp . 
baerga look better , though possible dp % would lower 
different ss . 
baerga consistently turn twice many double play , however ? 
alomar 
establish high level defense , baerga . 
would bet 
alomar better next year , last year baerga good overall .
