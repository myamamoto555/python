fortunately , better wiring technique 
high frequency ; cray computer , least 
backplane . 
get trouble 
much higher frequency ttl handle . 
` increase ' 
wiring capacitance really relevant use 
transmission line technique , capacitance problem .

good ac power one ,

low-cost one work well . 
hand-powered terrible choice unless 
field maintenance person maybe dozen connection 
time . 
hand cramp . 
battery-powered gun 
available $ 150 range , little 
manual type $ 15 . 
modest project , 
couple hundred connection , would prefer borrow professional 
ac unit ... pneumatic one .
