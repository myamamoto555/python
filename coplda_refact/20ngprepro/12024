paul mention `` thorn '' , actually sharp stake 2 
corinthians -9 
+ keep elated abundance 
+ revelation , thorn give flesh , messenger 
+ satan , harass , keep elated . 
three 
+ time beseech lord , leave ; 
+ say , `` grace sufficient , 
+ power make weakness . '' 
explain , need moral 
problem . 
one guess paul disorder eye . 

ordinarily dictate letter , add personal note 
signature . 
end letter galatians , say , 
`` see , write large letter hand , '' else , `` see 
long letter write hand . '' 
former 
translation adopt , seem paul could write 
small script practice writer , need make letter 
larger , suggest eye problem . 
, say 
galatian 4:13 -15 , 
+ know bodily ailment preach 
+ gospel first ; although condition trial 
+ , scorn despise , receive 
+ angel god ... bear witness , possible , 
+ would pluck eye give . 
perhaps last line mean simply , `` would anything 
, withhold precious possession eye . '' 
case , would expect wording like , `` 
need . '' 
`` possible '' sound though bodily 
ailment connect eye . 
william barclay , volume act , make specific 
suggestion . 
paul preach highland galatia , 
preach coastal area asia minor . 

malarial attack , doctor would advise 
leave low country head hill . 
malaria might well 
give severe headache blur vision .
