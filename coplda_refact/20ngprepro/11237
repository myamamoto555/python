people risk die hostage situation might 
consider acceptable scenario storm compound . 
everyone die save nine people , include twenty child , 
outcome must consider failure . 
failure due circumstance , incompetence ,

come fbi reno find `` honest mistake '' hard swallow 
let 's hope get story straight second round question .
