need give info want get answer ! 
: p 
want texture map , cause would ask . 

simple fast routine fill polygon . 
processor , would 
minimum 286 ... maybe 386 find good one 286 . 
ideally , want function clip user-defined viewport , 
write arbitrary location memory . 
course chance 
find something like pretty remote , guess would need source 
. 
oh , guess would need asm otherwise would 
slow . 
see polygon routine c , 
slow . 
3d vector graphic program . 
hunting high low 
function asm , find one anywhere use . 
find one two function , asm pretty bad , 
even try rewrite .
