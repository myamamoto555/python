threaten one . 
neighbor think little 
strange kind people would want live 
next door . 
one version batf serve search warrant jump 
horse trailer gun toss concussion grenade . 

true order event ` cult ' could know 
search warrant serve since proof 
guy police , ` cult ' every right defend 
. 
: torch show tactic , convince 
: realy belong society ... 
watch actual footage fire start finish 
clear fire start tank . 

people survive claim fire start 
tank knock kerosene lantern . 
fbi 
claim ` cult ' start fire . 
` realy belong society ' catchy phrase 
personally wait see texas rangers say 
pass judgment . 
. 
interesting fact waco incident : 
1 original assault conduct batf officer wear 
assorted type camouflage . 
see , cnn , least 
three different type . 
would hard press identify 
bunch guy ` ' battle fatigue 
uniformed officer law even claim 
police . 
2 batf lie beginning : 
+ `` handgun '' - original footage show 4 batf 
officer roof top get shot , one 
assault sub-machine gun . 
+ `` gun '' - sub-machine gun shotgun 
best quarter weapon , gun 
best gun available job . 
+ `` know gun would shoot door ! '' 
- 
one best , gun shoot 
household door , house wall 
matter . 
since officer bureau alcohol , tobacco , 
firearms know , either lie incredibly 
incompetent . 
mention criminally negligent 
shoot bullet think stop encounter 
plywood . 
+ `` search warrant . 
actually , arrest warrant . 
, wait , . 
yeah , ticket . 
oh , child molester . 
make drug . 
mention think rocket launcher . '' 
- story batf fbi spokespeople change daily 
claim get increasingly outrageous . 
3 throughout siege fbi batf claim one 
biggest concern koresh follower would 
mass suicide . 
claim 
surprise . 
huh ? 
think anything fbi batf say 
take grain two salt . 
rob .
