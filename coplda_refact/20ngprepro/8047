alcohol ban today , would much 
difficult manage large-scale smuggling operation . 
cop rank narrow notch military 
communication , intelligence gathering firepower . 
similar vein , amount marijuana smuggle 
country greatly decrease . 

low compare cocaine 
heroin . 
simply worth risk , uneconomical . 
, reefer domestic . 
less pressure 
domestic producer showy raid notwithstanding 
thus economical . 
note though ... domestic reefer 
strong , small volume go long way . 
make alcohol stronger 200 proof - 
good deal . 
firearm tend fall low area . 
would economic smuggle . 
production 
would local . 
many people 
skill motivation assemble worthwhile 
firearm scratch . 
high-ranking crime figure could 
obtain import uzis , average person , 
average thug , would lucky get - would 
pay nose .
