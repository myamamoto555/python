study 1986 1992 videotape jose canseco prove 
interesting . 
enlighten . 
's analysis jose canseco , circa sep ' 92 , jose canseco , 
circa june 1986 . 
1 . 
bulk much . 
period . 
need lose 20 pound , 
gain bulk . 
2 . 
bat speed absolutely vanish . 
conservatively , would say 
lose 4 % -7 % bat speed , huge amount speed . 
3 . 
open stance kill . 
note act sort like 
brian downing - way open start , close ball 
release . 
downing could without significant head movement - 
canseco . 
also , note canseco always close 
stance way - sometimes , hip open , sometimes , 
fully close . 
without good start point , hard 
make adjustment swing . 
would , jose ? 
aside salt away large sum cash could never touch , 
would never work , would restructure entire swing . 
first , minimize movement swing . 
close widen stance , 
severely cut stride take swing . 
hopefully , 
cut time need swing , allow move 
freely . 
second , drop 20 pound . 
cut weight work . 
third , relax wrist . 
cost power , find 
1988 stroke , concentrate keep back shoulder , roll 
wrist strike zone , hit line drive . 
strength 
enough line drive get 
park . 
canseco 's open stance result bad habit result back 
problem , 'll baseball three year . 
, could 
still hit 600 + hr .
