good point , brett . 
might merely proof basic health care 
market operate differently , certain nonmarket phenomenom 
private sector handle well like army vs. warlord . 

respect , effect american society vs. 
society might also different . 
, example , relevance blue cross 
massachusetts employ people , employ 
canada 's health program , insure 10 time many 
people ''

good point . 
blue cross u.s. quite convoluted compare 
canadian german insurance fund , minimal 
organization coordinate . 
anything , bureaucracy need 
build canada combat fraud , americans cross 
border individually use insurance card borrow friend 
relative use phony domestic address , fraud ring steal 
block . 
private practice record insurance 
account number , public insurance private insurance , 
never bother assumption honor 
system .
