? 
fast , wide spec much bandwidth stupid 
ide crap ... 
stop thread , clutter bandwidth . 
want 
read vs ide pay visit local usenet archive . 
best fast , wide , etc clearly faster best ide drive . 
response give base upon personal experience 1 2 
drive . 
judge completely different interface . 
ide low cost + descent performance . 
scsi ability super high capacity speed . 
neither one better case . 
belive say pick 
back issue test , eisa isa 
card . 
send flame ...
