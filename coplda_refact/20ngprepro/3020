evidence indicate gamma ray burster far away ? 
distribution isotropic intensity distribution , 
crudely speak , indicate see edge distribution . 
give enormous power , wonder , 
quantum black hole something like fairly close ? 
would galactic range ? 
, good old day gro datum , think 
gamma burster neutron star galaxy , expect 
gro would confirm either show local population 
within hundred light year galactic 
halo . 
mechanism know several plausible one exist 
also fair note _ brightest _ burster 
probably lmc , suggest theorist might wrong back ... 
sun center galaxy halo 
population show anisotropy local disk population 
rule completely stage - avoid anisotropy 
push halo , energy get large , mechanism 
get n far become questionable , start 
see example andromeda 's burster . 
datum consistent either oort cloud distribution 
- one think plausible source 
right spectrum . 
, cosmological distance hence 
isotropy edge `` edge universe '' ; - 
cosmological distance need high energy detect 
compact source spectrum , ergo neutron star 
collide another neutron star black hole . 
even get 
spectrum hard , conceivable . 
know anything physics level , 
burster due quantum black hole cosmic 
string , wrong spectrum one thing . 
situation complicate recent claim 
two class source collide n 
would actually probably fit relatively easily 
collision scenario respectively 
pet theory flying saucer enter 
hyperspace : - 
reason ask everyone assume 
collide star spin black hole , wonder 
mechanism could exist place closer . 
think one , remember invite stockholm ...
