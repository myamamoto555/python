second source algorithm 
chip also escrow key ? 
`` reputable firm '' produce 
chip escrow key replacement clipper 
chip phone , use algorithm widely know evaluate 
`` trust , '' problem ? 
clipper go reverse engineer anyway organization 
sufficient resource say `` billion cocaine dollar ? '' 

drug dealer worried slip 
crack . 
law-abiding citizen , naturally , 
recourse . 
claim algorithm 
release prevent people use chip plain 
deceitful ... analysis chip output provide information 
necessary header whatnot , `` bad guy '' could build chip 
use different algorithm still escrow key . 
, could buy bunch cheap phone k-mart every week , 
play cellular phone every day .
