run emu 25 mhz 68020 box . 
make 
difference performance whether cursor set blinking 
think bit , cycle 400 m hell lot 
time even slowest pc . 
since would course enable 
blinking text cursor input focus , 
application active anyway . 
repeat , blinking text cursor 
cost almost nothing performance , need think 
design software .
