's fallacy , first time point . 
fallacy - note . 
supermajority disinterested people 
agree value ethic yet benedikt , 
difference people agree trivial 
observation ? 
one , never give set moral people agree upon . 
unlike 
#a football . 
, conveniently ignore 
would agree morality something . 
analogy 
hold . 
, however , give example value people agree , explain 
. 
people agree freedom valuable . 
also 
state value necessary condition objective 
ethic - assertion . 
talk , 
point talk ethic agree . 
expect sufficiently many people agree football , 
give evidence vanish number disagree 
set moral give . 
moral ethic get past value . 
say , 
cogent objection ` freedom ' example maybe people 
talk thing answer valuable . 
maybe , want think , especially implication 
true . 
, evidence , proof . 
proof would evolve testing 
theory absolute moral compete theory . 
garbage . 
proof either . 
#the one argument reiterate never answer 
#the objection . 
evidence preacher . 
name fallacy .
