say rely feeling experience since 
source information leave . 
convince somebody `` feeling experience '' 
correct one show somebody visible 
measurable effect ? 
experience say `` exist god '' 
say , leave ? 
since 
go experience , correct within personal 
reality . 
furthermore , trouble `` feeling experience '' 
lead astray , tragic outcome waco illustrate . 

sure many koresh 's follower really believe 
think agree mislead . 
finally , earth come conclusion physical 
sphere self-explanatory rely five sens ?

must use definition `` evidence '' familiar . 
, evidence something show - unambiguously - 
say true . 
however , agree belief matter faith . 
something share around - must experience 
. 
unfortunately , explain , put 
belief matter experience . 
impression christian 
monopoly reason , evidence faith far 
thing go . 
> previous article , say : 
> 
right science reason prove anything . 
however , 
use believe faith alone . 
since 
use faith , one picture `` god '' e.g. hinduism less 
valid another e.g. christianity ?

risk repeat argument : explain previously , 
trouble moslems , buddhists , jews , etc say 
claim , good reason , valid system , possess best 
evidence , explain god revelation man buddhists 
read `` explain non-existence god '' . 

must `` prove '' case , `` disprove '' . 
good place see people strong belief 
faith ... good reason 
> doubt christian use reason , read newsgroup 
> see rational debate aplenty . 
know people use reason ... never claim . 
wish make sure argument well-founded . 
go 
without say make blunder expect people correct 
. 
go process remove 
non-essential contradictory bit , hopefully make 
progress towards truth .
