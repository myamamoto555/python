well , first work much cold gas need , make 
tank big enough . 
sound rocket payload , telemetry , guidance , etc. etc. 
telescope cluster , weigh around 1100 pound . 
use freon jet 
steering controller alignment ie 
eight minute space , jet pretty much 
continuously firing ~ 10 % duty cycle ... . 
jet also 
need kill residual angular momentum spin stabilization , 
flip payload around look sun . 
two freon tank , hold ~ 5 liter freon speak 
memory last flight . 
ground crew wsmr choose 
much freon use base algorithm . 

extra tank module bolt payload stack . 
give idea order magnitude cold gas 
quantity . 
really need know , send email 'll try get 
touch ground crew people . 
cheers ,
