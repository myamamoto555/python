note , distinction _ motivation _ 
_ method _ . 
experimental result accept unless 
describe sufficient detail replicate , replication 
indeed reproduce result . 
theoretical argument 
accept unless present sufficient detail follow , 
reasonable , , people agree force logic . 
people try experiment , pursue argument , sort crazy 
reason . 
irrational motivation curiousity ; 
large part history science . 
couple negative point make : 
1 theory could , conceivably , become accept without direct 
verification existence . 
example , quark accept 
part standard model physics , direct verification . 

would need would theory , base , predict medical 
reality better alternative . 
central theoretical claim could 
lie forever beyond experiment , long sufficient body 
experimental datum theory predict better . 
would hold breath wait triumph , though . 
think even coherent theory base , much less 
theory explain anything better modern biology . 

hard imagine theory would predict way rather 
directly verify existence . 
2 science historically progress sort rational 
sequence . 
experiment carry , 
interpret , pre-existing theoretical framework . 
theoretical 
controversy day determine experiment get . 
overall , 
huge messy affair personal jealousy , crazy motivation , 
petty hatred , like determine experiment , 
computation , get . 
keep go forward critical 
function science : result count unless replicate . 
whole system sort mechanism . 
generate 
part totally irrational , long test part work properly . 
pasteur could believe whatever like chemical activity crystal ; 
even mitscherlich agree racemic acid crystal hand ; 
separate handedness , get two chemical rotate 
polarize light opposite direction ; version 
indistinguishable tartaric acid . 
pasteur 's irrational motivation 
lead replicable , important , result . 
lysenko , creationist , etc. fail . 
usually 
even produce coherent theory predict much anything . 

theory predict , contradict experiment , 
concede point modify theory ; rather try suppress 
result lysenko try divert attention evidence 
think support position creationist .
