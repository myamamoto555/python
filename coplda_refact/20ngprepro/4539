actually , research greek word `` , '' 
find denote success . 
scholar indeed excellent 
reason assume suicide successful . 
point , 
recently check several lexicon : 
`` greek english lexicon new testament , '' louw nida 
`` robinson 's greek english lexicon new testament '' 
`` greek english lexicon new testament , '' grimm 
`` word study concordance , '' 
`` greek english lexicon new testament 
early christian writings , '' 
`` new analytical greek lexicon , '' 
couple simply state `` hang oneself '' , couple explicit 
state `` '' mean specifically `` kill hang . '' 

couple also note meaning one root word `` '' 
`` strangle , throttle choke '' pretty much invalidate guy 
suggest david joslin judas hung upside . 
one best 
reference though , `` robinson 's greek english lexicon new 
testament , '' state translation , give root word , 
literal translation , related greek word use root , also 
present specific example word greek literature give 
context . 
word `` '' two root word : `` '' `` strangle '' root , 
root word `` apo '' mean literally `` away . '' 
root word include 
word denote transition . 
mean transition place eg : 
greek word `` '' mean send message . 
`` apo '' also denote 
change state specifically change life death . 
robinson 
specifically make comparison word `` , '' mean `` kill . '' 
literal mean word `` '' mean `` throttle , strangle put 
way , '' implicitly denote change life state ie : away 
life , death . 
word `` '' mean `` hang , '' 
specifically denote death well . 
thus robinson quite specific 
state mean `` hang oneself , end one 's life hang . '' 

note use `` '' homers denote context . 

present example `` '' use explicitly mean `` suicide 
hang . '' 
since perfectly good word strangle , without 
add denotation `` death , '' insist bible write 
god , every word correct , stick complete 
meaning `` '' ie : since word `` '' use , death 
denote result . 
way , note mr also present example `` '' : 
> septuagint greek translation ot use time jesus , 
> use 2 samuel 17:23 : `` see advice 
> follow , saddle donkey , arise go home house , 
> city . 
put household order , hang , 
> die ; bury father 's tomb . ''

note mr , say , septuagint translation hebrew 
greek , show original meaning hebrew ie '' 
hebrew say `` die '' , thus whether simply echo greek . 
also point , regardless add `` die '' , 
correct translation would still `` , '' man indeed die 
strangulation redundant , correct . 
, evidence 
septuagint repeatedly rewrite include version 
contradict , editing even necessarily 
execute greeks . 
thus sure use septuagint 
stand , paragon ancient greek . 
, really need prove 
point mr , example , ancient greek , someone commit 
`` '' survive . 
otherwise would see simply make worthless 
assertion without corresponding evidence . 
would note mr , everytime go way research 
one apparently contrived , pretty much find false . 
thus , 
think go add text , something 
source clearly say , better explicit greek 
historical source justify . 
way , mr rose 's statement tree around potter 's field : 
> still tree around ledge rocky pavement bottom . 
unless mr rose show tree two thousand year old , 
2000 year old stump , 2 thousand year old description 
area mention tree , inappropriate 
assert present placement tree prove location tree two 
thousand year ago , thing change . 
argument , ie : money judas use 
30 silver : 
> second question mr , ask could sure 
> money juda purchase land , indeed betrayal , rather 
> source . 
would point act , specifically 
> mention `` reward iniquity '' act 1:18 , also specifically mention 
> act iniquity talk ie : act 1:16 '' ... concern 
> juda guide arrest jesus . '' 
. 
would point 
> bible describe act `` iniquity , '' immediately 
> discuss '' reward iniquity , '' would rather inane suggest 
> action iniquity one discuss . '' 
> 
> 
> notice verse 16 , word `` iniquity '' use . 
rather , state 
> judas `` become guide arrest jesus '' . 
> writer stop ... vs. 17 , `` number 
> obtain part ministry . '' 
part judas play ministry ? 
> ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
true , peter author act specifically call judas ' betrayal 
`` iniquity , '' matter , neither john specifically call juda ' 
action `` iniquity '' either . 
john 13:29 say judas take 
money box , rather say : 
`` think , judas money box , jesus tell 
`` buy need feast '' ; give something 
poor , receive morsel immediately go , 
night . '' 
note say judas leave , say take money 
box . 
thus see explanation still seem would choose 
unproven iniquity , mention another author , different 
book , write different time , iniquity explicitly mention 
author act . 
find force contrived . 
course particular argument become moot , since see 
evidence `` '' mean suicide . 
see , since judas ' hanging 
successful , could spend money mention john 13:29 , 
matthew mark explicitly say betrayal high holy day ie : 
passover , thus could spend money kill 
next day . 
thus money buy `` field blood '' would 
30 piece silver course get 30 piece silver 
night well , thus could spend either . 
oh dear , 
believe house card com . 
maybe point , discuss whether jesus crucify 
friday saturday part argument judas . 
way , prophesy potter 's field come ie : 
mention matthew , say : 
> please , study death , remind discuss 
> . 
remind discuss . 
part verse 
discuss , wish would quit procrastinating sidestep 
issue . 
later , 
dave butler 
wise man proportion belief evidence . 
david hume , philosopher 
inquiry concern human understand 
ps . 
would note , state bible 
possibly inerrant ; state inerrant . 
since , admission , present merely `` possible '' 
reconciliation course rate highly , 
best say bible `` possibly '' inerrant , 
inerrant .
