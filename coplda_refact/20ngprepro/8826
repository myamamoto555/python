anyway , think `` revenge '' `` fairness '' people 
favor punishment . 
murderer go punish , people 
think `` get deserve . '' 
people would 
think would fair murderer live , victim die .

require compassion , forgiveness , sympathy ? 

someone wrong , take great length make sure advantage 
remove , similar situation force upon . 
someone kill 
another , apply golden rule kill person turn . 
entire moral system base concept ? 
, state human life sacred , somehow , 
never violate ? 
would sound like sort religious view . 
mean , reasonable imprisonment , really , think ? 
sure , person could release find innocent , still 
undo serve . 
perhaps 
people could watch closely instead . 
cost would 
probably similar , especially implant sort 
electronic device . 
> would rather alive prison dead chair ? 
criminal commit murder , desire irrelevant . 
, still answer question . 
concern 
death penalty due possibility execution innocent , 
concern share imprisonment . 
, 
logic , administer minimum punishment possible , avoid 
violate liberty happiness innocent person ?
