tend disagree - think anecdotal evidence , provide lot , 
fairly consistent , important . 
first , point 
necessity study , second , least say effect 
psychological possibly allergy case . 
point 
, pyschological effect less real effect . 
one 
person 's `` make-believe '' easily another person 's reality . 
use 
drug bizarre twisted example , hallucination one 
person experience acid trip guarantee another person 
acid trip - clinical evidence effect always go 
happen . 
anyhow , pretty lame example , hopefully make 
point - matter perception , long someone ingest msg 
perceive cause bad effect , definitely experience 
affect . 
hand , could allergy food , something . 
still , anecdotal evidence worthless - stuff 
lead study .
