suggestion ? 
glad hear bozo manage stop . 
ride 
two year , rule traffic light survival : 
- try never stop hill behind car . 

stop location , pull almost completely next 
car front . 
one ie car front , 
turn bike somewhat sideways across lane , increase 
visibility oncoming vehicle . 
make sure keep 
taillight visible traffic , though . 
note : bike bright 
white ; turn sideways black bike might beneficial . 
- flat road , stop bit room ahead usually 
two three bike length . 
hopefully give 
room pull forward side car approach . 
- last line vehicle , watch mirror 
constantly ! 
see vehicle approach , see 
evidence indicate slow , get 
way ! 

- flicker brake light . 
last vehicle line , 
pull release brake car approach 
behind notice car watch mirror , course . 
vary speed flicker , hope make cager notice 
something lane ahead . 
, say , situation first line 
feel defenseless . 
first line , forward escape 
route seriously limited - move forward extent 
enter intersection . 
leave room behind stop line 
although around , # @ $ ! 
light activator always right 
next stop line ! 
, watch mirror . 
think decide 
hop bike might best way situation . 
idea first line traffic directly behind 
?
