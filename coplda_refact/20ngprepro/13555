firstly , aside : 
agree weakness exist , lot trouble 
believe represent difficulty real life . 
give : 
1 . 
purpose one-time pad give unbreakable security , 
expense key distribution etc. , imply client 
really want level security 
2 . 
people want keep p secret 
find hard believe eve might happen copy p 
lie around . 
aware argument apply eve know even small 
part message , eve must know exactly byte 
c known start , result garble . 
find 
least surprising . 
back question : 
resource use transmission , 
would also append message authentication code message , use 
next bit key perhaps . 
original 
question basically ask whether way authenticate 
message degree security pad provide , 
know answer . 
however , would propose follow 
discussion . 
alice bob arbitrary number secret , random bit 
share , eve know . 
find effectively 
know p corresponding c. fact 
correspond cause problem . 
message authentication code 
create use operation eve could 
know part mac affect part input , 
would unable forge mac correspond . 
require non-linear combiner part message . 
non-linear simply subtract whatever 
exactly effect . 
, end encrypted message c , alice append mac 
compute follow s2 mean next full chunk one time pad : 
1 . 
compute c2 p xor s2 , pad boundary 
2 . 
break c2 chunk 
3 . 
set mac 0 vector 
4 . 
chunk sequentially 
set mac mac c2 
end process mac message authentication code . 
bob verify mac obvious manner ; recover 
plaintext p , use pad reproduce mac 
manner . 
non-linear operator , rub . 
simplest 
non-linear operator think s-box ; , fix 
even publish permutation integer , table 
call , use : 
x y x xor y . 
practically speak , think solve problem , eve never 
see intermediate output c2 , hence deduce s2 perform valid 
substitution . 
also practically speak , want mac fairly large , say 32 
bit , might want 4 gigabyte say s-box , might 
work 4 s-box , think irrelevant detail 
discussion hand . 
first point error , give pointer 
literature ?
