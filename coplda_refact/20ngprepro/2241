, would obvious choice : armed self-defence clearly 
strongly protect colorado constitution law 
state . 
clear-cut situation hypothetical , 
would anything fear police unless 
publicly carry weapon conceal , something 
habit ... even , worst would deal 
class 2 misdemeanor . 
even situation 
clear , might worry arrest manslaughter 
homicide , would still safer wait police . 

leave try avoid police involvement , would commit 
several felony ruin chance claim self-defence 
court `` really self-defence , '' prosecuter would 
ask , `` run away hide police ? '' 
state , however , decision might clear-cut : 
someone , say , washington d.c. use gun self-defence 
would _ automatically _ guilty several felony violation 
city 's gun control law . 
person 's choice would 
certain conviction couple felony versus possible 
conviction half dozen .
