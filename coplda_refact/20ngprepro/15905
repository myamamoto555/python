since candida 
colonize primarily area , gi symptom common

always use conventional wisdom . 
good example 
kidney stone . 
conventional wisdom clinical trail 
come effective prevention , 
intake calcium oxalate best way prevent kidney stone 
form . 
clinical trial focus drug ultrasonic blast 
breakdown stone form . 
recent new england j 
medicine article , know conventional wisdom wrong , 
increase calcium intake better prevent stone formation 
restricting calcium intake .

candida . 
gordon , think best clinical 
trial candida bloom would involve give woman chronic vaginal 
candida bloom l. acidophilus orally see decrease 
frequency extent candida bloom vagina since 
candida seem migrate anal region l. acidophilus 
able keep candida check make 
intestinal tract colonize anus access 
oxygen like vagina . 
much stuff 
lay press l. acidophilus vaginal yeast infection , really 
amaze someone clinical trial yet check . 
calcium kidney stone story good reason throw 
conventional wisdom window . 
would medicine 
conventional wisdom use develop many standard 
medical practice could confirm clinical trial ? 
clinical trial new arrival medical scene 
important one . 
lack proof good bacterium 
antibiotic use important health patient reason 
dismiss , especially 
safely like animal husbandry .
