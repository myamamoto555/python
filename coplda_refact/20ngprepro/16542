actually , record allies activity , face 
incontrovertible evidence nazis may rot hell 
, clearly point conclusion would 
nothing . 
railway camp bomb , despite ease 
. 
us , `` place refuge '' allow bare pittance 
jews europe , primarily public relation , 
government could say `` something '' . 
many ship 
refugee turn away us shore ; find refuge cuba 
south america , many sink return europe 
predictable consequence . 
hope today 
collectively learn lesson , less complacent ignore 
country ' `` internal affair '' . 
sad reality 
seem case .
