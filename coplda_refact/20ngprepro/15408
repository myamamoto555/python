officer yell `` police '' repeatedly . 
use every day bust drug 
house . 
idea awe suspect submission surprise 
display order avoid gun fight . 
knock , 
sad necessity many case since suspect attempt escape even 
fight . 
usually strategy work ; , would use 
commonly , would ? 
whether appropriate use strategy bd 
point , since think enough information make clear 
judgement issue . 
merely point valid strategy use every day . 
furthermore , know substitute strategy capable apprehend 
potentially dangerous armed suspect . 
suggest police 
always knock gun holster never arrest suspect 
allow inspect officer 's badge ?

fake `` competition '' ? 
even get deadly enemy may pretend cop , 
excuse murder police .
