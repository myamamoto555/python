civic still come 4 door model . 
wife look 
quite seriously 626 , prizm corolla , civic , well 
car . 
impression : three seem well build 
feature want - similar feature want 
except cruise control , want manual transmission 
consider anti-lock brake . 
also hate automatic seatbelt 
think airbag plus . 
general , comfort 
performance significant . 
specific + 's - 's list . 
mazda 626 
+ comfortable roomy 
+ theoretically get ab dx model , though practice 
hard find 
+ base price base model include numerous little thing like : 
tach , variable speed wiper , rear defroster , split folding rear seat 
- expensive many car list 
honda civic 
+ dx get significantly better mileage car list 
+ comfortable front seat 
+ adjustable seat belt mount 
- ab without ex model include $ 1000 's thing like sunroof 
geo corolla 
- seat comfortable mileage may vary 
+ adjustable seat belt mount 
+ get ab without lot extra 
saturn 
+ sl2 quite comfortable , though sl1 less 
- motorized attack belt 
dodge spirit 
real outstanding + 's , seem generally ok 
- rear seat fold 
chevy corsica 
+ come ab standard 
- lower `` would buy car '' safety rating 
consumer report first 3 car 
- suspension feel stiff would + 

honda accord toyota camry expensive 
626 , mind , significantly better . 
probably give disproportionately low consideration `` big 3 '' , 
due wife 's family 's general dislike chrysler product , 
b unimpressive gm product parent housemate 
mine c taurus come automatic transmission , find 
seat tempo uncomfortable , escort attack belt 
air bag . 
'll probably end 626 - see 626 dx 
cassette advertise $ washington post , april 14 , 
think , local dealer say match price . 

probably get 626 maybe tomorrow . 
main question mind 
whether `` factory order '' `` preference 
order '' get one ab , whether dealership 
run price lot .
