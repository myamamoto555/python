may root confusion ... 
please consider follow hypothetical open mind . 
note 
yet say anything 
question hand . 
suppose simplify lotto game . 
pick number 1-10 
win number draw . 
suppose large population 
people play game every week . 
first year game , approximately population 
win 7 time . 
second year game , 7-time winner 
7-time winner . 
third year game , win 7 time 
first two year win 7 . 
suppose start 1024 people population . 
three 
year , 32 people consistently , last 
three year , win 140 % number time expect . 
expect big winner fourth year game ? 
. 
know skill involve . 
nothing 
`` consistent winner '' influence chance win . 

suppose know whether chance skill 
might involve . 
perhaps people population 
psychic , something . 
would test hypothesis ? 
look correlation population . 

population show zero correlation . 
psychic show 
high positive correlation even good psychic , 
still manage win 7 time year . 
net 
result ? 
small positive correlation entire population .

well , zero correlation zero correlation . 
mention sabo 
hit poorly clutch last 3 ? 
year . 
look 
past , find clutch pattern likely reverse 
remain consistent . 
length streak 
seem make difference probability player 
clutch choke next year . 
reason expect 
streak different past streak ? 
true `` 75 % three-year streak remain true 
form '' , might something useful . 
would 
zero correlation . 
instead `` 50 % three-year streak 
remain true form , 50 % three-year streak reverse '' . 

look number say `` three year choke streak imply 
likely choke year '' . 
would equally valid look 
number say `` three year choke streak imply likely 
clutch year '' , since probability split 50-50 
way .

would something useful . 
would also 
positive correlation . 
every individual exhibit 
pattern hold true , another exhibit pattern 
reverse .
