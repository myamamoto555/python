see point , strongly disagree . 
repent means turn around . 
, nation , behave incredibly 
arrogantly toward god condone , encourage , even force folk 
participate activity directly oppose write word god . 

arrogantly set nation far god create allow 
luxury living land . 
set bad example 
nation . 
slaughter unborn child million . 

stricken name god classroom . 
cheat god 
honor due every turn , owe god apology every bit public 
sin . 
jesus say `` judge ye judge '' , address 
like john baptist repent call 
repent . 
address remain sin heap 
condemnation sin . 
message remove 
log eye remove speck brother 's . 

also say rebuke reprove . 
forget command 
. 
problem today tend judge condemn though 
rebuke tend neglect bring folk back lord 
excuse want judge anyone . 
truth , need judge less call repent 
able distinguish two motive . 
call sin 
openly . 
let charge fall correctly . 
instead run someone hell , pull 
path onto heavenward path .

`` deplore horrible crime child murder ... 
want prevention , merely punishment . 
must reach root evil ... 
practice whose inmost soul revolt 
dreadful deed ... 
mater motive , love ease , 
desire save suffer unborn innocent , 
woman awfully guilty commit deed ... 
oh ! 
thrice guilty drive 
desperation impel crime . ''
