spacecraft shut fund cut . 

example , could magellan tell go `` safe '' 
mode stay bob venus mode 
maybe year funding get restore economy 
get better hopefully , could turn .

> , problem political one , technical one . 
also remember every dollar spend keep one spacecraft safe mode 
probably spin-stabilized orientation dollar 
spend mission analysis newer spacecraft . 
order turn 
spacecraft back , either need insure op guy 
available , need retrain new team . 
say , spacecraft propose . 
many operational satellite goddard fly like tiros noaa 
series require one satellite orbit operational set . 
extra get replace on-orbit power `` standby '' mode 
use emergency . 
case , however , op team still 
require fly operational bird ; standby maintenance 
relatively cheap . 
finally , pat 's explanation spacecraft require continuous maintenance 
stay control also right mark . 
suggest spin - 
stabilize control mode would require little power 
maintenance , still might require momentum dump time 
time . 
end , political decision since difference money , 
technical rationale behind decision .
