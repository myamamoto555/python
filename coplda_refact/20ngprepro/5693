name rather descriptive . 
command spacecraft tell 
`` hear earth 264 hour , assume something wrong 
spacecraft attitude , go preprogrammed search mode 
attempt reacquire signal earth . '' 
spacecraft earth constant communication . 
earth monitor telemetry spacecraft , everything fine , 
reason send new information . 
spacecraft 's 
point view , information earth could mean either everything 
fine , spacecraft lose signal acquisition . 
long 
spacecraft wait decide something wrong 
begin take corrective action ? 
`` long '' command loss timer . 
relatively inactive cruise phase , command loss timer set 
rather long value . 
case , earth tell galileo `` expect 
hear back sometime within next 264 hour '' .
