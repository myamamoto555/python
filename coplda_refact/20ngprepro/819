one say ? 
stupid leave helmet seat 
fall go boom ! 
kind fall helmet design protect . 
fall helmet hit spot helmet land 
drop , helmet may protect head well 
intend . 
conservative ` ers recommend replace 
helmet . 
want sure protect adequately , 
. 
helmets go ground , table , chair , shelf , 
surface large enough support 
easily knock . 
. 
new shoei would $ 340 replace . 
think go 
leave chance ? 
cripe . 
later ,
