turn one problem set class 
little problem . 
calculator , problem set 
long ago , 'll use , hope want . 
highly simplify problem , simple burst . 
burst 
usually complex example use . 
burst peak flux erg cm ^ -2 sec ^ -1 duration 
8.95 seconds . 
second burst , last 4 seconds , 
flux half peak flux . 
flux peak flux rest 
time . 
assume background flux erg cm ^ -2 sec ^ -1 . 
find integrate luminosity burst , several 
different sphere : r .25 pc oort cloud radius , r 22.5 pc edge 
galaxy , r 183.5 pc edge galactic corona , lastly 
r . 
integrate flux time find fluence , use 
old standby : 
luminosity 4 pi r ^ 2 
radius .25 pc , find l around 10 ^ 32 . 
pretty 
energetic close . 
coronal model , find around 10 ^ 43 . 
lastly , cosmological model l 10 ^ 53 . 
would call 
moderately energetic , would say . 
suggestion could put 
much energy one second ?
