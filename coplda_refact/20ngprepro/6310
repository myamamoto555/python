also much would one cost ? 
board year , work , 
, due licensing problem stac technologies , 
owner board 's compression technology . 
write 
memory ; lose reference . 
please correct wrong . 
use board , problem file icon lose , 
hard say whether board 's fault something else ; however , 
decompress troubled file without board , 
icon usually reappear . 
mention licensing 
problem , freeware expansion utility dd expand decompress 
file unless board install . 
since stac product , seem unlikely hole 
related board fix . 
sad , make reluctant buy stac 's product since 
stinky . 
hey , competition .
