wrong . 
admit handle greek grammar , thus 
confuse `` '' , second last word act 1:17 plot 
land discuss . 
actuality `` chorion '' , last word act 
1:18 . 
unfortunately greek dictionary discuss `` chorion '' 
report nuance word . 
know someone else would catch , though sure 
someone would able , aversion disseminate 
mistake , especially someone else might use mistake prove point ''

question : find criterion important ? 
, plan start

reason simple ... passage . 
claim 
passage contradict one another ; see passage contradict one 
another . 
1 may well complimentary , many scholarly source mention ; 
2 matthew may present judas ' death , claim . 
'll look 
defense later . 
also , `` reward iniquity '' act passage may 30 piece 
silver matthew 's passage . 
although valiant attempt later 
state believe . 
begin stage debate , lay scriptural 
groundwork , expand upon deeper exegesis .

`` course reason see drastically reinterpret passage 
juda ' death , make agree another passage 
could consider correct . '' 
reply ... 
one reason give different exegetical view passage 
seem think majority scholarship wrong conclude 
passage complimentary . 
however , see problem tony rose 's 
explanation judas ' death ... 

would explain inaccuracy judas hanging 
matthew `` fall headlong burst open '' 

question manner judas die one 
constantly confront travels . 
many people point apparent 
discrepancy two account obvious , irreconcilable error . 
go far say idea inerrant bible 
destroy contradictory account . 
however , case 
. 
matthew relate judas hang , peter tell fall 
crush impact . 
two statement indeed different , 
necessarily contradict ? 
matthew say judas fall ; neither peter say 
judas hang . 
matter one person call 
something black person call white . 
account 
true supplementary . 
possible reconstruction would : judas hang tree 
edge precipice overlook valley hinnom . 
hang 
time , limb tree snap rope give way juda 
fall ledge , mangle body process . 
fall could death either would fit 
explanation . 
possibility entirely natural terrain 
valley hinnom examine . 
bottom valley , see 
rocky terrace 25 40 foot height almost perpendicular . 
still tree around ledge rocky pavement bottom . 
therefore , easy conclude judas strike one jagged rock 
way , tear body open . 
important remember 
tell long judas remain hang tree advanced 
decomposition body fall . 
louis relate story man determine kill . 
individual place sill high window point 
pistol head . 
pull trigger leap window 
time . 
hand , person could say man take life shooting 
, another could rightly contend commit suicide jump 
form tall building . 
case , true , true 
case matthew 's peter 's account death judas . 
merely 
situation different perspective event . 

reason reject , believe , attempt discredit 
inerrancy .

even . 
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
say earlier post ... 

although still agree tony 's exegesis probable 
explanation regard judas ' death take account several criterion , 
recently notice new thing matthew . 
mat -8 throw piece silver temple depart , 
go hang . 
chief priest take silver piece 
say , `` lawful put treasury , 
price blood . '' 
consult together buy potter 's 
field , bury stranger . 
therefore field call field 
blood day . 
first , notice text say judas die result 
hang . 
say `` go hang . '' 
luke however , 
act , tell `` fall headlong , burst open middle 
entrails gush . '' 
pretty clear indication along 
detail give act - peter 's speech , need pick new apostle , 
etc. least judas ' fall , dead . 
whole concept 
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
matthew luke recount juda ' death highly probable , clear 
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

joh say , care poor ,

joh 13:29 thought , judas money box , jesus 
say , `` buy thing need feast , '' give

right peter state judas play part ministry treasurer ,
