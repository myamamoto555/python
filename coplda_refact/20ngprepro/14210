common misconception . 
patent law mention valid 
purpose infringe patent . 
although clear order 
create new invention either base prior patent avoid infringe 
prior patent , one must perform research exist patent . 

say infringe patent assume talk rsa 
patent research purpose wink wink , nudge nudge never 
develop related invention ie . 
use , would clear 
infringement .
