know . 
anyone nasa land know much fuel 
budget altitude change ? 
henry , figure mass full edo pallet plus 
dry weight ? 
dry mass ? 

check last . 
also , need . 
1 current orbital parameter hst 
2 project orbital parameter . 
3 discovery 's dry weight 
4 hst 's dry weight . 
somehow think could train new eva 8 month .

like general rule . 
> 
long need train ? 
year ? 
2 year ? 
somehow 
think 2-3 moth adequate .

hst design on-orbit servicing . 
lot easier .

come time every project , kill management . 
neccessary , hst mission . 
december 
drop dead date , unlike say retrieval mission .

suspect , , may enough basic thrust hst 
. 
mayu need bigger tank , bigger thruster . 
understanding second hst servicing mission 
contingency . 
understanding mission need 
new foc work electrical system , plus 
another .

somehow , think cost expendable smt less 
$ 500 million . 
extra stuff real cheap . 
nasa lot suit , mmu 's , 
edo pallet re-usable . 
oh , one double magnum champagne , 
couple hundred buck .

door cycle , x time already . 
massive g loading . 
somehow think work ou ; reliability method ensure 
door work . 
also , please tell sort sublimate material like 
co2 , h2o would manage contaminate mirror , anything 
go vapor state , adhere mirror . 
somehow , door , problem work . 
maybe put one 
time spring . 
, door hang . 
door part 
mechanism . 
hang tomorrow , ` ll 
8 month someone get witha crowbar fix .
