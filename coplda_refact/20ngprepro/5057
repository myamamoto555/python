subject : need postscript info 
summary : seek algorithm endpoint `` snap '' 
keyword : postscript emulation adjust stroke 
organization : sq software via world public access unix , brookline , ma 
lines : 31 
need information display postscript feature . 
feature adjust endpoint line display line 
look better low resolution device . 
postscript literature explain process extent . 

also give example `` emulate '' postscript 
environment absent . 
suggest emulation modify coordinate endpoint 
line use follow coordinate : 
round - 0.25 + 0.25 
end coordinate end '' .25 '' . 

read think might actually : 
2 2 + 0.25 
result coordinate end either `` 0.25 '' `` 0.75 '' 
whichever closer . 
actual comparison display postscript , find 
neither dps really use . 
since like dp 
result look better stuff look , would like know 
anyone know dps tell . 
thanks ,
