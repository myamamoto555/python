hmmm ... sound vaguely similar problem long time ago 
try use kermit . 
build serial connection duo 210 
next . 
think problem handshaking . 
basically , need 
make sure handshaking protocol side . 
safe 
place start select handshaking either end . 
one problem 
zilog serial chip seem get permanently wedge talk 
wrong , reset clear . 
know specifics . 

could nonlinearity screw attempt debug system . 
could well thing right -- eventually -- one 
wrong move like try bad handshaking protocol screw 
correct action , next machine reset . 
wedge mac also 
next way . 
send file back forth duo next without 
problem , pretty high speed . 
know kind chip pc use , think zilog 
pretty standard . 
hope help ,
