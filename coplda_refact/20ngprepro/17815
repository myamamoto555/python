| 256k cache , isa , vlb , ram 
| ati graphics ultra pro , 2 meg ram , local bus 
| 15 '' monitor , nus 
| 3com iii 
| maxtor ide hard drive 
| however , part fit ! 
local retailer apparently put one 
| together , discover ati card would run - surprise 
| surprise . 
actually , read group , surprised even

better , keep mind

mind size image , opinion go vlb . 
_ much _ eisa , fact utilize 
card . 
make measure , someone else may 
share experience . 
also , faster operation , run internal

advice . 
| quite happy ati card - fast , datum get !! 
| ~ slow ~ repaint image move screen , 
| uncover ! 
| seem enough raw cpu run ! 
sluggish 
| run local window manager . 
also , many function take

| enough memory system - 1 meg 
| leave much room app . 
page disk 
| medium size image . 
try run without cache ? 
need 
paging cache . 
well , might argue , paging 
cache . 
belief measurement app leave 
memory manage better sy .

| machine sustain ethernet sparc sustain 
| network . 
go 16 bit version smc card increase 
| transfer rate - still slow especially move large 
| image . 
thing ethernet card come ?? 

| make difference ? 
hope , lean towards choice

bandwidth theoretical isa , far 
0.15 . 
try isa ide hard drive maxtor get 
result - 0.65 - regardless isa bus speed 
.25 mhz . 
guess , combination 
lousy .

rumor likely chip come
