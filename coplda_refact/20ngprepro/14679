work , yes , _ visible light _ telescope ! 
hear anything adaptive optics ? 
lot research 
`` star wars '' funding , share 
astronomer . 
show great promise . 
soon , probably within

theoretical limit _ despite _ distortion atmosphere . 
say `` visible light astronomy already die field '' 
pure hokum . 
use `` logic '' thing already bad , 
matter get worse absurd . 
maybe common sense logic 
die field .
