yes govt handle rambo hollywood type style 
machismo . 
perhaps way handle 
. 
completely different thing start assert many 
government primarily blame . 
comparison 
nazi particular purely gratuitous . 
since provide constructive opinion issue 
post take seriously . 
peter nelson also make 
good point low key approach might 
effective . 
point though learn mistake . 
govt 
play wrong card lose . 
thats big deal . 

four guy murder begining 
prepare situation . 
could ? 
thing happen might perhaps 
able castigate govt use tactic fail 
way . 
say would make 
mistake . 
would rule go 
confrontational situation avoid . 
would 
press difficult try 
macho stuff . 
fbi information within compound access 
. 
may calculate follower resolve 
crack base listen device within compound . 

know koresh chicken one suicide attempt . 

may reason consider fear might 
weapon break resolve . 
panama use 
heavy rock music great effect bush 's invasion . 
funny 
koresh supporter complain much 
death several thousand civilian us govt attempt 
arrest former ally .

koresh 's civil rights exist whether

koresh negate civil rights minute follower fire 
police helicopter . 
matter whether warrant 
technically valid guy carry 
think . 
thus assault completely 
inexcusable matter rationalisation people might wish 
employ . 
course consider gun issue . 
whole 
core question . 
everything else diversion .
