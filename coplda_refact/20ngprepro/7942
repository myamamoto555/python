number point . 
make assumption manner 
card use . 
true , law , resident , citizen , 
tourist must carry form identification . 

citizen , standard id id card . 
purpose serve 
daily basis , wherein present public place , 
purpose identify bearer . 
take place 
bank cash check , post office registered mail , etc. . 
. 
quite frankly , rare ever present id card 
activity per week . 
law 
requirement force people wave id card public . 
furthermore , none service outline discriminate 
bearer manner access information . 
case think field might 
take account interaction police , 
base upon scenario . 
general though , arab citizen 
clearly recognizable , non-arab . 
argument therefore 
become moot unless provide example field 
use discriminate officially .

take issue assertion . 
think arab country 
know nothing fear `` israeli expansionism '' . 
militarily , israel capable hold onto large tract 
land occupation hostile , arm , insurgent population 
sustained period time . 
, intifada heavily tax 
israeli economy . 
proof see israeli 
withdrawal lebanon . 
israeli troops pull back 
awali , later litani , order control minimal 
strip need keep town range katyusha missile fire . 
public opinion israel turn towards settle intifada 
via territorial concession . 
israel public 
battle fatigue sort gov ' aware . 
regard border , let state follow . 
may agree 
manner negotiation hold , however crux 
matter everyone either make refrain state 
start position . 
arab party call total withdrawal 
return border . 
israel state large border , 
negotiation might never get way . 
israel state 
smaller border , arab country might try force even smaller 
border negotiation . 
think leave matter 
settle negotiation peace treaty infinitely realistic 
sensible .

would appreciate honesty . 
statement typical simple mind naivety `` center 
policy research '' . 
whether vanunu 's revelation true 
bear fact . 
disclose `` state secret '' 
sign contract form understanding 
say secret make public , one punish . 
, moral obligation 
disclose - quite reverse fact . 
take court , try , find guilty . 
may take issue 
number thing clearly understanding 
concept `` secret state '' , something every democratic govt 
.

think ? 
notice document fact prisoner could exist 
document fact exist . 
clu note , 
evidently pay attention , know 
report case . 
sorry tell country 4 mill , 
tightly knit israel , even matter arrest 
make public , within relatively short time frame , people would know 
. 
feeling matter arrest 
make public unless court order issue allow delay x hour . 
would grant judge could convince 
announcement would cause irreparable harm ongoing investigation .

sign weakness , strength . 
well , sorry say question slant . 

question often term `` tabloid journalism '' 
disturbing avoid attempt objectivity . 
question often use mccarthy era 
basis witch-hunt take place . 
use 
example , question might lift 
format use stalinist prosecutor look 
small bit evidence could distort portray 
larger dirtier picture . 
answer `` hysterical '' question 
. 
problem q 's provocative , 
selective fact seek . 

fall category seek `` yes '' `` '' answer 
real answer `` sort '' . 
suspect long answer question 
unequivocal , would remain choose 
see fit . 
sign strength ability look 
remind mistaken environmentalist advocate 
cull wolf cruelty deer , find 
break food chain wreak havoc upon environment 
seek protect . 
color blindness exhibit true 
sign weakness .
