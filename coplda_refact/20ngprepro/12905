`` artist rendering '' see hst reboost still 
array fully extend , cradle hold hst ~ 30 degree 
angle shuttle . 
think render conceive 
array approve , sure current reboost 
occur array deploy . 
however , 
appear array retraction necessary reboost .

thanks input gro 's design constraint . 
would 
explain similar design uar .

heck , mms project use design _ mission _ servicing mind . 
spacecraft originally design on-orbit replacement 
instrument module . 
way , get two instrument 
price one spacecraft bus explorer platform . 

second on-orbit replacement also consider , fuse telescope .
