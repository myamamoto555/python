story : buy car state , try get 
safety inspection pennsylvania . 
problem car

waiver state police . 
go state police - 
officer tell aftermarket tint illegal , get 
waiver car medical reason . 
ask 
show section vehicle code say illegal . 

show say tint , 
see inside car tint . 
tell 
fact see inside well , shut book 
say `` illegal , fact someone give 
ticket right . '' 
well , argue ... 
since vehicle code say ok long see 
tint , would like keep 'll re-read vehicle code 
library . 
would also like get sort paper police 
say ok , get inspection , 
get trouble tint later . 
also would mind register
