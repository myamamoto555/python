see , 10 % less

sound like `` die '' 
fc > ... 
seem like fair comparison . 
infrared astronomy 
really get start something like 25 yr . 
ago ; 
explode iras 1983 . 
gamma-ray think 
x-ray observation really get start '70 . 
believe true ultraviolet observation 
general , know extreme uv short 1000 angstrom 
observation , launch last year almost 
history except observation skylab '70 . 
twenty-five year ago , vast majority astronomer 
access optical radio instrument . 
, far 
instrument available , growth new field 
result optical work represent smaller fraction 
total astronomical work .

hmm , folk department planning use 
adaptive optics 5 m palomar near-infrared 
observation 1 2 micron might surprise hear . 
ntt already push toward 0.1 arcsecond resolution , 
ground-based site remember 0.1 arcsecond one 
sell point hst .
