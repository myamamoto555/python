earlier claim one innocent death 
override benefit .

win war , 
> hurrah hurrah ! 
number civilian iraqi death way 
exploit anti-war emotionalism liberal news media . 

fact less iraqis die gulf war civilian 
war comparable size century ! 
due mostly 
short duration couple precise surgical bombing technique 
technically possible recently . 
idea `` hundred thousand '' iraqi citizen die 
ludicrous . 
even `` hundred thousand '' iraqi soldier die , 
one target ! 
think us 
ally specifically kill maim iraqi civilian ? 
either smart bomb hit target know , 
target civilian target ! 
hardly 
destroy iraq 's military potential . 
military mission planner 
fool , know hit military target win war . 
hit civilian target nothing unite people , 
laudable goal one want people rise 
.

innocent people die ww2 ? 
hear bemoan ! 
war never exact science , 
smart bomb , become exact smaller percentage 
civilian casualty . 
sometimes mistake make ; target 
misidentify ; innocent die . 
war way really . 
alternative , allow tyrannical dictator treat earth 
like one big rummage sale , grab everything get 
worse . 
like patrick henry say 217 year ago , `` know 
course may take -- , give liberty , give 
death ! '' 
war always price one must willing pay one 
wish stay free .

death penalty conceive deterrent crime , legal 
shenanigan add automatic appeal , lengthy court 
battle , etc. relegate purpose small part 
. 
hence question , instate death penalty 
mean , see deter crime , get rid 
entirely ?

mathew , sarcasm note completely off-base . 
come sound like complete idiot , although 
feel sure intent . 
iraqi war wrong , eh ? 
sure appeasement would 
work better war , like ww2 , eh ? 
guess 
fight ww2 either -- think innocent 
german civilian kill dresden hamburg . 
poor 
french die crossfire invade continent ? 

let hitler take europe , would speak 
german instead english right . 
tyrant like hussein stop . 
kind understand 
diplomacy ; understand point gun . 
regret 
bush wimp military roll baghdad , 
hussein still power iraqi people 's sacrifice 
mention 357 americans die naught . 
liberating kuwait 
good thing , wipe hussein map would better ! 
poor , poor rodney king ! 
ever stop think 
jury first trial bring back verdict `` guilty '' ? 
foam mouth blood 
policeman certainly look video tape . 
jury look evidence , evidence 
see . 
one make judgment without benefit 
trial evidence present side , one simply 
lower level vigilante justice , 
sarcasm seemingly speak , instead tend 
support case policeman . 
law country intend protect rights accuse , 
whether criminal cop . 
one find guilty 
reasonable doubt one 's guilt , jury position 
assess evidence render verdict . 
anyone else simply 
succumb verbal vigilantism .
