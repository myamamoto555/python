john e. king post whopping one liner : 
`` modern theory evolution inadequate deserve 
treat matter faith . '' 
-- francis hitching 
point make post . 
1 . 
science base consist `` quote '' either 
real alleged expert . 
critical reasoning , evidence possible 
experimentation necessary . 
creationist frequently display massive 
confusion merely quote non-expert expert alike 
latter quote fact false steadfastly refuse 
follow kind rigorous scientific procedure . 
strongly suggest 
a. claim completely lack scientific merit b. 
aware fatal deficiency . 
course , may actually 
creationist may real intent . 
2 . 
fail identify hitching surround context 
statement . 
? 
hitching scientific illiterate 
quote would merely display profound ignorance evolutionary biology . 
creationist frequently know quote real scientist context 
fabricate statement subsequently attribute legitimate 
scientist . 
course , may actually creationist may 
real intent . 
3 . 
evidence support alleged inadequacy `` modern theory 
evolution '' would much powerful argument one 
line quote unidentified nobody . 
also important note 
disprove biological evolution automatically prove alternate 
claim disprove earth shape like hockey puck 
prove hyperbolic paraboloid . 
creationists seem rather fond 
diving head first logical fallacy . 
course , may 
actually creationist may real intent . 
4 . 
since evolution central virtually modern science , attack 
evolution either fact theory really represent attack 
science . 
theory unquestionably continue evolve b ^ 
fact evolution ever go away . 
creationists lose battle long 
ago 100 year fact simply willfully ignorant 
irrational acknowledge fact . 
course , may actually 
creationist may really ignorant . 
warren kurt ask : 
neither , webster 's ever hear francis hitchings . 
? 

, like hitchings , find webster 's b ^ . 
francis hitchings 
scientifically illiterate creationist perhaps play 
part one write quite ignorant book attack evolution `` neck 
giraffe '' . 
publication quote creationist jean sloat morton 
use standard invalid creationist probability argument protein could 
form chance . 
thus confusing abiogenesis evolution 
two quite independent also conclude `` non sequitur '' i.e. 
conclusion `` follow '' .

lewontin effort support creationism . 
pp 84

`` go darwin like mark 
antony brutus . 
flip scientific reasoning mysticism 
pseudo-science sinuosity salesman . '' 
`` suggest 
mystical ` organize principle ' life , use similarity organ 
different creature evidence sic . '' 
note last statement actually evidence evolution
