subject : voltage multiplier problem . 
organization : computer science , liverpool university 
lines : 53 
: 
hus , 
build valve preamp use 
voltage multiplier step supply voltage approx 
. 
load resistance increase , rc constant decrease 
hence output voltage drop . 
need high output 
voltage possible . 
. 
circuit consist seven voltage multiplier stage 
ie 14 diode 14 capacitor capacitor develop 
across , take output across seven capacitor . 
capacitor . 
increase capacitor rating , 
increase rc constant , hence alleviate problem . 
capacitor go little expensive need 14 
, : 
1 . 
would happen connect capacitor parallel 
output hence parallel seven capacitor ? 
, assume , increase c circuit hence increase 
rc time constant ? 
, output voltage become 
stable , kill two bird one stone ... 
experience ripple hence amp hum , new 
capacitor ` smooth ' . 

2 . 
anyone suitable value inductor choke 
place output line power supply filter 
main hum . 
lowest resistance possible ! 
get preamp moment much 
distraction ... university get get 
dissertation finish two week 
hence mail 
play iron 'll cheaper long 
run ... especially 14 new large capacitor work plan ! 
email please ... always read net ... 
thanks advance .
