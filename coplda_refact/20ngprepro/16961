course discuss sabbath folk , 
come across something completely new , 
think would offer comment . 
keep brief possible , let state 
observation declarative statement , whoever 
want comment . 
basically , think 
observe phrase `` ten commandment '' , 
use moses , reference ex . 
20:1 -17 , 
rather reference ten distinct discourse ex . 
20:1 ex . 
. 
, phrase `` ten 
commandment '' accurately translate `` 
ten discourse '' , passage call `` ten 
commandment '' really first . 
completely convince true , 
purpose discussion , let argue though 
sure . 
argument support idea : 
1 really ten commandment ex . 
20:1 -17 . 
order get 10 commandment , get two 
verse 3-6 , verse 
support division 
worship god . 
, verse 3 command 
god , verse 5 command worship 
idol mention verse 4 . 
violate 
verse 5-6 without violate verse 3 , indicate 
whole passage one command , leave 
nine `` commandment '' . 
could go length 
, 'll stop summary . 
2 ten speech ex 20:1 beginning 
traditional `` ten commandment '' ex 
god actually give moses two tablet 
ten write . 
break 
ten follow : 20:1 -17 ; -26 ; 21:1 ; 
25:1 ; -16 ; -21 ; -33 ; -38 ; 
-11 ; -18 . 
case , 
passage begin variation phrase , `` 
lord speak moses , say ... '' exception 
ex . 
21:1 , begin `` ordinance 
set ... '' 
3 word translate `` commandment '' phrase 
`` ten commandment '' really word 
`` commandment '' , word speech , 
utterance . 
word often use longer discourse 
rather individual statement ; instance , 
combine word ` yom ' day , word 
translate `` chronicle '' phrase `` rest 
act so-and-so , write 
chronicle x ? 
... '' word `` commandment '' 
freely use throughout book moses , perhaps 
significant moses speak ten x 's , 
appear avoid word commandment 
choose instead word associate discourse longer 
single command . 
4 god tell mose go give 
stone tablet `` law commandment '' ex 
, yet give moses tablet 
finish ten discourse mount sinai . 

ten commandment ex . 
20:1 -17 , 
immediately clear god would wait several day 
nine discourse give tablet 
mose . 
hand , ten discourse 
write tablet , make perfect sense 
god would give moses tablet 
finish deliver ten discourse . 
5 moses get tablet , find 
tablet write side ex . 
. 

ten `` commandment '' first 17 verse 
ex . 
20 , god would write large 
letter ! 
could , course , 
seem likely reference 
two tablet contain ten discourse write normal - 
size letter . 
6 ii cor . 
3 , paul seem specifically single 
`` commandment write stone '' 
`` ministry death '' , `` fading away , '' 
`` ministry condemnation . '' 
possible 
exception commandment sabbath , 
difficult see paul would refer command 
ex . 
20:1 -17 temporary , `` fading away '' - type 
commandment . 
less problem stone 
tablet happen include 
commandment ex 20 ex 31 . 
argument idea : 
main argument idea , aside fact 
contradict long-standing tradition , 
dt 5:22 , moses say , quote command 
ex . 
20:1 -17 , `` word lord speak ... add 
. 
write two tablet stone 
give . '' 
appear identify word 
quote contents two stone 
tablet . 
first impression , anyway . 
however , 
thought , note great deal hinge 
understand phrase `` word . '' 
moses mean 
`` word relate 
speak god '' etc. , would mean 
traditional `` ten commandment '' stone 
tablet . 
, however , moses make parenthetical 
comment -- `` word tell 
speak god '' etc. -- quite different . 
note dt 5 account , moses tell 
give stone tablet tell 
people ask moses represent god , 
whereas exodus account , people ask 
mose first second discourse , several 
day god give moses stone tablet . 

reinforce idea moses ' remark dt 5:22 ff 
intend parenthetical remark , rather 
strictly chronological account god write , 
point stop add 
tablet . 
summary : thing consider , find somewhat 
likely nine command ex 20 really 
first moses regard ten discourse 
god . 
know anybody ever espouse 
idea ; brand-new . 
, lean 
towards accept , would interested 
hear comment criticism anyone may care 
offer .
