... performance centris 610 price . 
reason 
get really need full-size nubus slot . 
keep 
mind 610 support apple monitor optional ethernet . 
lessen eliminate need nubus card . 
unless 
run software , 610 blow door 
. 
, hand , sufficient 
people great price . 
guess , find halve bus clock vs. 
bus throughly bad thing hope apple never .
