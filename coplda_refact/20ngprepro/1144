high-speed silicon adc 100mhz currently 
fabricate . 
phd research project test 
chip speed pcb . 
expect roughly 100 
package circuit dc , low-speed high-speed 
testing use 3 different set-up test chip . 
know sure dip work 
long lead line high inductance . 
get custom-made package expensive , 
try choose 
chip carrier . 
would hard 
test since solder test 
setup would spend load time soldering 
keep change test chip . 
chip 
carrier socket also long lead line may 
work high speed . 
anyone 
field ? 
would greatly appreciate help ! 
idea 
name company manufacture 
would help .
