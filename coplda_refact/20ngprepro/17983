tradition , common belief various christian group . 
hear various people outside news group 
describe idol power , money , material 
possession etc. . 
thing worship sense 
suppose , never really give idol much thought .

every time sin , might well stick sharp stick 
christ 's side take punishment sin , 
die cross .

wow ... hope spend 
summer convincing one way 
tongue read `` charismatic chaos '' . 
guess 'll study 
tongues parallel read news group . 
help 
give appreciate . 

think issue much people educate 
though may well , come 
different tradition . 
discussion catholics protestants . 
catholics 
generally believe mary sinless . 
protestants . 

issue come different source authority . 
protestants 
generally limit bible source doctrine . 
since bible except passage one would 
understand way already believe , protestants 
accept . 
catholics see continue revelation 
church , though believe result consistent bible . 
interpret post , call yet another argument 
whether catholic marian devotions idolatry argument 
prepare see , sign interested 
learn tradition . 
catholics 
course major one , mean one . 
generally 
consider major tradition catholic , orthodox , 
various subset protestantism . 
within protestantism , matter 
finely want cut thing . 
day think major 
division accept biblical inerrancy 
. 
also number major historical tradition , 
recent decade distinction tend blur . 
would 
identify major protestant tradition : 
lutheran , reformed , anglican sort halfway 
catholic protestant , wesleyan , baptist , holiness , pentecostal , 
church christ 
number . 
historical distinction tend 
important among liberal church anymore , think 
current trend society church also tend make 
conservative see ally general `` evangelical '' 
perspective . 
difference among various tradition still 
quite marked . 
think best introduction issue read good book 
church history . 
anyone want understand church really 
need understand get . 
church history 
normally show tradition come , 
give feeling nature . 
unfortunately away 
library moment , anything specific recommend .
