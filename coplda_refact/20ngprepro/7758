reference , etc. remember content means 
reader judge truth message , 
inaccuracy tend discredit entire message even

test system 
send anonymized mail . 
- aware policy anonymous site respect . 
prepare forfeit anonymity abuse privilege . 
- considerate respectful 's objection anonymity . 
- `` hit-and-run '' anonymity use utmost reservation . 
use service provide anonymous return address instead .

_____ 
< 8.4 > history behind anonymous post server ? 
originally anonymous post service introduce 
individual , particularly volatile newsgroup , anonymity 
almost preferred method communication , 
. 
one first one dave mack 
start ~ 1988 . 
another early one 
run stephanie enterprises 
disband due lack fund . 
system provide 
anonymous return address . 
. 
john take 
function server , include reinstate anonymous 
alias file . 
group `` chew 
server like tomorrow . '' 
spur disappearance ` ' interested 
research idea , karl 
< > develop system 
scratch six hour . 
time idea extend 
server new , ` mainstream ' group start emerge , 
explore possibility partly specific request 
multiple user anonymity group . 
`` intend 
advantage system specifically allow multiple group 
support , single anon identifier across . 

arguably single biggest deficiency previous anon system . '' 
k. post message ask user whether 
anonymous service would welcome , judge consensus 
. 
k. introduce call `` fire extinguisher '' 
` squelch ' ` plonk ' abusive user response complaint , 
use three case . 
nevertheless , month 
intense traffic eventually overwhelm abuse 
server . 
`` even restricted , system subject 
abuse point order dismantle 
facility staff . 
abuse start right 
create . '' 
~ nov 1992 , johan helsingius set 
controversial anonymous site date . 
base 
script c code write k. support 
mail , post , return address . 
initially want confine 
service scandinavian user expand worldwide 
response ` lot ' international request . 
j. helsingius policy allow anonymous post every usenet 
newsgroup meet strong serious ideological 
opposition e.g. news adminstrator . 
relative newness recent emergence medium , 
abuse anonymous poster tend higher visibility 
`` routine '' abuse . 
total commitment preservation 
anonymity also controversial . 
example , highly controversial publicized case ~ feb 
1993 , anonymous user post suppose transcript desperate 
crew dialogue challenger shuttle disaster via 
. 
despite transcript 
post place year earlier 
actually originate poster 
new york news tabloid , subsequent response consist largely 
vociferous outrage poster 's use anonymity , reverberate 
many newsgroup . 
original poster , use anonymous handle , later concede 
story `` seem likely fabricate , '' 
suggest plausible possibility original intent 
provoke outrage gauge reaction authenticity 
story albeit crudely , free personal risk perceive 
association item . 
ensue commotion generate query 
original article reader . 
anonymous 
user later post deliberately offensive comment 
detractor . 
despite piercingly irate outraged complaint , even vocal 
opposition verbal abuse k. eminent news 
operator , j. helsingius largely avoid use `` fire 
'' `` group bouncer '' mechanism limit 
scope service . 
~ march 1993 site 
best describe ` inundate ' : register 13,000 user 
initial three month operation , forwards ~ 3000 message 
day , approximately 5 % usenet posting 
site . 
immense popularity probably largely due 
capability ` global ' anonymity allow user 
find creative use diverse area previously envision . 
johan helsingius subject extraordinary pressure 
dismantle server ~ feb 1993 . 
one point k. 
threaten publicly organize sort vigilante group irate 
news operator send revocation command message 
originate site . 
j. helsingius also allude 
threat flood server . 
server crash several 
time , least due saturation ` ' 
anonymous user . 
mr. helsingius report spend 5 
hour per day answer email request alone associate 
service 's administration . 
response serious threat 
disabled global group access temporarily one week 
encourage user defend service publicly . 
base fast-moving dialogue creative suggestion 
`` cypherpunk , '' j. helsingius identify many security 
weakness valuable new feature service , 
currently process code development testing . 

plan upgrade ibm compatible 386 machine 486 soon 
handle voluminous load consider integrate new 
system sophisticated functionality , include multiple 
email alias , alia allocation control , public-key encryption , 
etc. . 
sophisticated anonymous post system set dec. . 
1992 d. clunie < > use cryptography 
direction server highest degree 
confidentiality see far . 
however , run public 
access account , shut several 
week , upon receive request condition apparently ultimately 
originate nsf representative . 
d. clunie release 
software public domain . 
recently idea newsgroup devote ` ' 
government abuse receive wide focused attention , 
group formation currently underway . 
basic scenario 
group would allow people post pseudonymously use remailer , 
even establish reputation base 
digital signature . 
traffic may eventually reach reporter 
mainstream news media . 
volunteer 
attack multiple aspect project , include distribute 
easy-to-read documentation post , , 
encryption .
