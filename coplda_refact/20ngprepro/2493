even independent proof luke 's account 
valid , find strange would take negation 
truth without direct historical evidence least ` ve 
mention back . 
assertion make , unequivocally 
christian ever faith believe 
resurrection . 
luke 's account suggest otherwise , 
absence direct eyewitness claim luke mistaken , 
suggest unequivocal assertion suspect .
