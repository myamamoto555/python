citizen , arm purpose go 
military exercise evolution , often might necessary 
acquire degree perfection would entitle 
character well-regulated militia , 
also talk `` well regulate militia '' nationally 
uniform structure . 
note quote end particular paragraph state :

year .

group poeple twice year . 
try get people 
every year , provide basic training new people 
integrate force , find suitable location , 
require continually stand committee organizer . 
since well regulate militia nationally uniform structure 
, meet twice year train , claim 
`` well regulate militia '' well organize . 

`` well organize militia '' necessarily `` well regulate militia . '' 
several people state `` well organize militia '' 
define 10 usc 311 , state 
militia united states consist able-bodied 
male least 17 year age , except provide

deo define militia , adjective `` well regulate . '' 
10 usc 311 define `` well militia '' way , shape , 
form .

federalist papers clearly define `` well militia '' 
proper subset militia .

country , amount , calculate upon 
present number people , would fall far short 
whole expense civil establishment 
states . 
attempt thing would abridge 
mass labor industry considerable extent , 
would unwise : experiment , make , could 
succeed , would long endure . 
another quote provide charles scripter : 
james madison , federalist paper 41 regard `` general welfare '' clause : 
`` nothing natural common first 
use general phrase , explain qualify 
recital particulars . '' 
phrase `` right people keep bear arm , shall 
infringe '' must either qualify explain phrase `` well 
regulate militia , necessary security free state . '' 
definition `` explain '' state `` american 
dictionary language '' new college edition , 1982 : 
1 make plain comprehensible ; remove ; 
elucidate : `` economist undertake explain 
puzzle '' 
2 define ; explicate ; expound : explain plan . 
3 offer reason cause ; answer ' justify : 
explain error 
second phrase clearly `` explain '' first , therefore 
second phrase must `` qualify '' first . 
definition give 
`` qualify '' : 
1 describe enumerate characteristic quality 
; characterize . 
2 make competent suitable office , position , 
task . 
3 give legal power ; make legally capable . 
4 modify , limit , restrict , give exception . 
5 make less harsh severe ; moderate 
6 grammar : modify meaning word phrase 
since `` right people keep bear arm , shall 
infringe '' describe , modify make less harsh anything 
nothing grammar sort position task . 
process elimination must fall definition # 3 . 
since 
# 3 deal legal power , thing constitution , 
must correct definition case . 
therefore , `` right 
people keep bear arm '' give legal power `` well 
militia '' legal power `` shall infringe '' . 
thank much mr scripter , provide 
evidence second amendment concern 
people 's right form well regulate militia , say little 
right untrained person `` keep bear '' .50 caliber 
machine gun . 
since , totally untrained use firearm 
something mean correct go nra gun 
safety course join gun club , legally buy machine 
gun , conclude court elect congress agree 
. 
- > know category mr. rutledge ; mean destroy 
- > liberties rights . 
mean `` liberties rights . '' 
participate 
discussion exactly `` rights '' ? 

force version `` liberties rights '' begining statement 
`` liberties rights '' `` second amendment

clearly mean intend force view ? 
think . 
effort force view `` liberties
