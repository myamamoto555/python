well , best thing read book `` parallel universe '' 
dr. fred wolf . 
essence , dr. wolf say one interpretation sub-atomic 
duality perceive wave actually 
number parallel universe overlaid , 
universe particle different location . 

something make particle `` appear , '' actually cause 
parallel universe collapse one . 
apparently 
one line think nature qm , go 
scientific community . 
dr. wolf many claim somehow collapse cause 
mental effort observe particle . 
imply 
mind merely biological phenomenon . 
extrapolate 
mind integral part universe , perhaps consciousness 
element give order form universe . 
get rather interesting , find 
would explain phenomenon `` magick '' practice 
religion . 
dr. wolf speculate order functionality mind 
could cause selection future infinite number 
possible future ; say might sort 
communication one current , possible future self . 
long speculate magick merely form self 
delusion perhaps could cause sort selection 
one many possible future . 
realize get pretty bizarre , never hurt keep 
open mind least file away another possibile 
world find . 
, 
learn universe live , learn 
truly strange place .
