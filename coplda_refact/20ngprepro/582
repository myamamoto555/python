interesting discussion . 
limit one ` standard serve ' alcohol 
go ride . 
mostly , unless alcohol something 
special fine ale , good wine , someone else 's vsop , usually 
drink . 
alcohol really important , mainly 
financial reason ... 
least one magazine claim follow 
aviation guideline `` alcohol whatsoever '' within 
24hr ride ` company ' bike . 
remember mag though , year ago .
