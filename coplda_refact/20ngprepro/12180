paul - 
wonderful job anything possible 
offend catholics ; hopefully careful wording 
. 
also want extend topic entire major issue 
debate anymore already , note two : 
1 . 
please talk jesus ' `` parent '' -- doctrinal position 
church unequivocally different regard mary 
joseph . 
personally never hear anything 
attribute st. joseph sainthood ; , 
reference ever sinless , assume heaven , 
immaculately conceive , etc. -- idea apply 
mary . 
2 . 
would agree little scriptural evidence 
doctrine mary . 
needless say , present 
significant problem accept bible 
source doctrine . 
, however , one turn sacred 
tradition undivided christian church , 
problem finding evidence basically 
unanimous belief among apostle early 
generation mary assume heaven , body soul , 
etc. etc. . 
reformation doctrine 
call question . 
far concerned , 
feeling choice apostle 
luther , 'll choose apostle every time , whether 
record within writings tradition man 
determine `` bible '' . 
like say , couple note . 
often say , believe 
must agree politely disagree . 
may god 's peace blessing always search 
discover absolute truth .
