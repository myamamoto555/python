two thing annoy pc magazine review : 
1 . 
benchmarking technique seriously flawed , clearly show 
graphite # 's `` cheating '' . 
admit 
benchmark easy optimize cheat ? 

much harder beat ... 
2 . 
big `` cheat '' use 
optimization , hercules send new driver 
-- produce almost identical score . 
yet , thing 
pc magazine say score `` legitimate '' -- could 
least make comment real-world performance ? 
much go performance , , rather , steve 
gibson 's result , real-world base like use micrografx 
draw benchmark . 
believe gibson , ... write : 
`` despite document cheat , say real-world 
application hercules graphite adapter actually draw faster 
display adapter industry . 
... even though 
modest isa bus card , outperform every local bus adapter 
, include stealth 24 vlb , fahrenheit , 
ati vlb even diamond viper vlb . '' 
kind praise enough interested , bogus
