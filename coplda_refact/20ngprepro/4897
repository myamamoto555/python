proton use 2 , 3 , 4 stage version . 
two stage version 
use first 3 launch , 3 4 stage version use 
today . 
four stage version use mostly escape geosynchronous ? 
orbit , 3 stage version use low earth orbit . 
since 
version launch mir salyut add-on module mir , 
long centaur smaller mir believe , fit 
shroud . 
vaguely recall russians develop upper stage 
proton .
