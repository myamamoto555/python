yea , thanks lot good information newsgroup , prepare 
lot detail even ship time ... get 5 week . 
guess biggest disappointment lack detail write 
spec documentation . 
case load spec example -- setup 
section say apple 14 '' 16 '' monitor go top , 21 '' 
big one . 
could publish maximum load ? 
figure hope use `` partition '' button 
hard disk setup utility dare try see happen ? 
, 
maybe divide wealth among family member bit 
. 
`` get information '' section manual suggest 
try avenue call apple , mention net .
