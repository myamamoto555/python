actually , accelerator daystar 33 mhz 68040 cheaper 
upgrade 25 mhz . 
accelerator cost $ 1400 whereas 
upgrade cost $ 2131 quote dealer . 
however 
upgrade give fast build video support monitor 21 '' 
8 bit depth 16 '' 24 bit depth additional vram . 

also scsi port capable much faster throughput ci , 
make big difference fast hard drive . 
improve video feature important , ` re 
better get upgrade , otherwise save money get 
accelerator .
