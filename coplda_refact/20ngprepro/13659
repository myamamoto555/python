sorry ian , toy several year . 
see 
inside quite year . 
see post lag 
quite day , think would toss $ 0.02 . 
assume 
functionally similar 6502 also make mo 
technologies ? 
. 
really verse 6502 base atari 
computer . 
2600 come later .

atari computer , `` cia '' chip refer sound awful 
lot like ctia color television interface adapter chip use 
early model . 
later atari upgrade graphic 
... . 
colorful literature state might stand 
`` george , '' developer chip .

funny , old new model . 
old one significantly heavier . 
additionally , think 2600 use 2k , 4k , 8k rom 
game .

2k 4k

idea much ram work , 
would hazard guess 2 4k ram . 
sorry , way line . 
first microcontroller build 
base chipset 128 byte onboard . 
easy 
work small 2k on-board eprom .

register also sit address space .
