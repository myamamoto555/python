defense driver , right lane . 
state , people simply expect drive overtake speed differential 50 + mph . 
think stupid course , exception , program limit . 
state look rear-view always calculate future position car base 50 + speed differential . 
dont get wrong , love drive left lane fast overtake 
car right , slow tad bit . 
rely judgement car , recognize speed differential , would stupid one . 
btw , one else around , go !
