although agree fatwa , apparently think 
rushdie kill book , yet think due 
sympathy threat . 
furthermore base 
reaction solely fact write particular 
well-known story -- true -- might reflect poorly 
absolute truth religion . 
yet , opinion form without 
recourse actually look see story use context , 
accept face value widespread propaganda 
book contain author 's motivation . 

come forward recommend another book touch presumably 
`` play '' material find 
overall presentation neutral !
