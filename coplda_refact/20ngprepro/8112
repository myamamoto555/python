objective : 
objective adj. 1 . 
material object 
distinguish mental concept . 
2 . 
actual existance . 
3 . 
a. emotion personal prejudice . 
b. base 
observable phenomenon . 
definition , science objective worth , since 
phrase `` objective worth '' oxymoron . 
however ask something 
little differently time , ask objective basis 
notion . 
fact use science intellectual tool 
responsible change world change material , 
thus `` objective '' would provide objective _ basis _ argument . 
however , conclusion arrive argument science 
`` good '' subjective . 
think problem one word usage . 
take little time 
read definition word : objective , subjective , worth , 
value , morality , good , evil . 
believe think 
meaning , conclude 
thing objective morality .
