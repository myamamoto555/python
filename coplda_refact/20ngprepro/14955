use windows nt tm since october release , 
say march release really big improvement . 
windows nt tm 
usable . 
thing consider make leap though . 
first least get full-speed box . 
mean , instance run falcon 3.0 
intensive program box . 
crawl . 
machine hd 16mb ram . 
anyone 
know get fast box full-screen matter , 
please let know . 
second thing still many driver around stuff . 
instance , demote run sound blaster 
natively support -- nice , 
produce driver yet . 
disk large enough keep partition , 
give rest windows nt tm . 
thing , whenever 
want run windows program , would reboot log 
windows nt tm , instead typing win . 
windows nt tm seem much stable normal windows 
though . 
would good choice resource . 

really least 8mb ram though . 
one last thing , modem work 
well enough , yet get fax card work , never 
hear anyone else either . 
better unix run killer software 
box , whereas unix . 
guess come -- windows nt tm yet faint 
heart , still beta . 
good beta .
