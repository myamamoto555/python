| talk isa bus , 1 dma channel 
| active one time , presumably transfer datum single device . 
| even though least 7 device scsi bus , explain 
| 7 device dma transfer single scsi card 
| bus time . 
one time mean single byte . 
four source 
dma request ready , dma would service one . 

bandwidth four together lower 
bandwidth , work . 
note bus master priority mechanism dma 
controller .
