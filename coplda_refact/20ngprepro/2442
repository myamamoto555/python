late physicist dewey b. larson 's comprehensive 
general unified theory physical universe , 
call `` reciprocal system '' , build two fundamental 
postulate physical mathematical nature 
space time : 
1 `` physical universe compose entirely one 
component , motion , exist three dimension , discrete 
unit , two reciprocal form , space time . '' 
2 `` physical universe conform relation 
ordinary commutative mathematics , magnitude 
absolute , geometry euclidean . '' 
two postulate , larson develop complete 
theoretical universe , use various combination 
translational , vibrational , rotational , vibrational - 
rotational motion , concept 
scalar motion , speed relation speed light 
larson call `` unit velocity '' `` natural 
datum '' . 
step development , larson able 
match object theoretical universe object 
real physical universe , photon , sub-atomic particle 
incomplete atom , charge , atom , molecule , globular star 
cluster , galaxy , binary star system , solar system , white 
dwarf star , pulsar , quasar , etc. , even object yet 
discover exploding galaxies , gamma-ray 
burst . 
apply theory new model atom , 
larson able precisely accurately calculate inter - 
atomic distance crystal molecule , compressibility 
thermal expansion solid , property 
matter .

physicist dewey b. larson 's background 
physicist dewey b. larson retired engineer 
chemical electrical . 
91 year old 
die may 1989 . 
bachelor science degree 
engineering science oregon state university . 

develop comprehensive general unified theory 
physical universe try develop way compute 
chemical property base element use . 
larson 's lack fancy `` ph.d. '' degree might one 
reason orthodox physicist ignore , 
valid reason . 
sometimes take relative outsider 
clearly see forest tree . 

time , clear book also know orthodox 
physics astronomy well physicist astronomer , 
well enough point contradiction , ad hoc 
assumption , principle impotence , , etc. . 
. 
larson fund , etc. experimentally 
test theory . 
necessary . 
simply compare various part theory 
researcher ' experimental observational datum . 

many case , explanation fit better . 
self-consistent theory much orthodox 
physicist astronomer ! 
claim look 
`` unified field theory '' work , 
ignore one 30 year ! 
`` modern physics '' explain physical universe 
well . 
part larson 's book full 
quotation lead orthodox physicist astronomer 
agree . 
remember `` epicycle '' , `` crystal sphere '' , 
`` '' , `` flat earth theory '' , etc. , also seem 
explain well , later prove conceptually wrong . 
prof. frank h. meyer , professor emeritus , 
strong proponent larson 's theory ,

`` super collider '' boondoggle ! 
contruction `` superconducting super 
collider '' , texas anywhere else . 
would gross 
waste money , contribute almost nothing `` scientific '' 
value . 
physicist realize , , accord 
comprehensive general unified theory late physicist 
dewey b. larson , describe book , strange goofy 
particle `` meson '' , `` '' , alleged `` quark '' , etc. . 
find existing collider fermi lab , 
cern , etc. really atom anti-matter , 
create high-energy collide beam , quickly 
disintegrate like cosmic ray incompatible 
environment . 
larger expensive collider create 
element anti-matter physicist 
see , physicist even 
confused ! 
type anti-matter atom worth $ 8.3 
billion cost 
much important use 
waste money ?! 
another thing consider primary propose 
location texas serious grow problem 
kind `` fire ant '' eat insulation underground 
cable . 
much poisoning ground ground water 
insecticide require keep ant 
`` supercollider '' ?! 
name `` super collider '' ronald reagon , 
propose , totally absurd ! 
build , 
name lead particle physicist . 
anti-matter 
larson 's comprehensive general unified theory 
physical universe , anti-matter simple case 
opposite charge type particle . 

rate vibration rotation 
photon make , relation 
vibrational rotational equivalent speed light , 
larson call `` unit velocity '' `` natural datum '' . 
larson 's theory , positron actually particle 
matter , anti-matter . 
positron electron meet , 
rotational vibration charge rotation 
respective photon make neutralize 
. 
larson 's theory , anti-matter half physical 
universe three dimension time , one dimension 
space , exist reciprocal relationship 
material half . 
relativity 
perihelion point orbit planet mercury 
observe precisely measure advance 
rate 574 seconds arc per century . 
531 seconds 
advance attribute via calculation gravitational 
perturbation planet venus , earth , jupiter , 
etc. . 
remain 43 seconds arc use 
help `` prove '' einstein 's `` general theory relativity '' . 
late physicist dewey b. larson achieve result 
closer 43 seconds `` general relativity '' , 
instead use `` special relativity '' . 
one 
book , apply lorentz transformation high 
orbital speed mercury . 
larson totally reject `` general relativity '' another 
mathematical fantasy . 
also reject `` special 
relativity '' , include part `` mass increase '' near 
speed light , use lorentz transform 
doppler shift , quasar greater 
1.000 really move faster speed light , 
although motion away time . 
. 
larson 's comprehensive general unified theory 
physical universe , three dimension time instead 
one . 
two dimension measure 
material half physical universe . 
one 
dimension measure clock time . 
low 
relative speed , value two dimension 
negligible ; high speed , become significant , 
lorentz transformation must use fudge factor . 
larson often use term `` coordinate time '' write 
. 
regard `` mass increase '' , prove 
atomic accelerator acceleration drop toward zero near 
speed light . 
acceleration 
acceleration force mass , . 
orthodox physicist 
ignore third factor : force . 
larson 's theory , 
mass stay constant force drop toward zero . 
force 
actually motion , combination motion , relation 
motion , include inward outward scalar motion . 
expansion universe , example , outward 
scalar motion inherent universe result 
so-called `` big bang '' yet another mathematical 
fantasy . 
universe motion 
wish recommend everyone book `` universe 
motion '' , dewey b. larson , 1984 , north pacific 
publishers , p.o. box , portland , oregon , 456 
page , index , hardcover . 
contain astrophysical portion general 
unified theory physical universe develop 
author , unrecognized genius , thirty year ago . 
contain final solution astrophysical 
mystery , include formation galaxy , binary 
multiple star system , solar system , true origin 
`` '' background radiation , cosmic ray , gamma - 
ray burst , true nature quasar , pulsar , white 
dwarf , explode galaxy , etc. . 
. 
contain astronomer astrophysicist 
look , ready seriously consider 
open mind ! 
following example theory 's success : 
first book 1959 , `` structure physical 
universe '' , larson predict existence explode 
galaxy , several year astronomer start find 
. 
necessary consequence larson 's 
comprehensive theory . 
quasar discover , 
immediate related explanation also . 
gamma-ray burst 
astronomer still scratch 
head mysterious gamma-ray burst . 

originally think originate `` neutron star '' 
disc galaxy . 
new gamma ray telescope 
earth orbit detect direction 
uniformly , source location space 
correspond known object , except case 
directional coincidence . 
gamma-ray burst necessary consequence 
general unified theory physical universe develop 
late physicist dewey b. larson . 
accord page 386 
book `` universe motion '' , publish 1984 , 
gamma-ray burst come supernova explosion 
anti-matter half physical universe , larson call 
`` cosmic sector '' . 
relationship 
anti-matter material half physical universe , 
way connect together , gamma-ray burst 
pop material half anywhere space , seemingly 
random . 
source location burst 
correspond known object , come 
direction uniformly . 
wonder close space source location 
would gamma-ray burst kill 
life earth ! 
would way predict one , 
stop ! 
perhaps mass extinction past , 
blame impact comet asteroid , 
actually cause nearby gamma-ray burst ! 
binary star formation 
half star galaxy 
vicinity sun binary double . 
orthodox 
astronomer astrophysicist still satisfactory 
theory form many . 
binary star system actually likely 
consequence comprehensive general unified theory

b. larson . 
try summarize larsons explanation , 
detail chapter 7 book `` universe motion '' 
book . 
first , accord larson , star generate 
energy `` fusion '' . 
small fraction come slow 
gravitational collapse . 
rest result complete 
annihilation heavy element heavier iron . 

element destructive temperature limit . 
heavier 
element , lower limit . 
star 's internal 
temperature increase grow mass via accretion 
absorption decay product cosmic ray , gradually 
reach destructive temperature limit lighter 
lighter element . 
internal temperature star reach 
destructive temperature limit iron , type 
supernova explosion ! 
much iron 
present ; related structure iron atom 
atom building process , larson explain 
book better . 
star explode , lighter material 
outer portion star blow outward space less 
speed light . 
heavier material center 
portion star already bounce around close 
speed light , high temperature . 

explosion push material speed light , 
expand outward time , equivalent inward 
space , often actually disappear . 
long period time , mass start fall 
back gravitationally . 
material blow 
outward space start form red giant star . 

material blow outward time start form 
white dwarf star . 
star start move back toward 
`` main sequence '' opposite direction 
diagram . 
chance two mass fall back 
exact location space , make single lone star 
, near zero . 
instead form binary 
system , orbit . 
accord larson , white dwarf star inverse 
density gradient densest surface , 
material center widely dispersed blow 
outward time . 
eliminate need resort 
mathematical fantasy `` degenerate matter '' , `` neutron 
star '' , `` black hole '' , etc. . 
. 
solar system formation 
mass heavy material center 
explode star relatively small , , instead single 
white dwarf star , several `` minus '' white dwarf 
star revolve around red giant star , probably 
still far away three-dimensional time affect 
heat , etc. . 
become planet ! 
chapter 7 universe motion , larson use 
information , principle comprehensive 
general unified theory physical universe , derive 
version bode 's law . 
`` black hole '' fantasy ! 
hear physicist stephen w. hawk recently 
complete theoretical mathematical analysis two `` black 
hole '' merge together single `` black hole '' , 
conclude new `` black hole '' would mass 
sum two original `` black hole '' . 
result recognize everyone red 
flag , cause widespread doubt whole idea `` black 
hole '' , etc. . 
! 
read physicist dewey b. larson 's book 
comprehensive general unified theory physical 
universe , especially book `` universe motion '' , 
clear `` black hole '' nothing 
mathematical fantasy ! 
strange object cygnus x-1 
unusually massive white dwarf star , `` black 
hole '' orthodox astronomer physicist badly want 
`` prove '' theory . 
way , understand much publicity 
give physicist stephen hawking . 
physicist 
astronomer seem act hawking 's severe physical 
problem somehow make `` wiser '' . 
! 
wish attention give physicist 
dewey b. larson still alive . 
widespread 
publicity attention give larson 's 
theory , book , organization international society 
unified science . 
electro-magnetic propulsion
