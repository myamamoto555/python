lead-acid secondary cell release energy electricity follow 
chemical reaction : 
pb + + -- > + 
lead lead iv oxide sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate water 
standard heat formation 25 c 77 f various compound : 
heat formation 
compound 25 c ,

h20 
heat reaction 25 c therefore kcal per mole produce . 
note lead sulfate soluble gram per 100 gram water 
25 c , thus precipitate solution reaction 
occur , cathode positive terminal battery . 
almost 
sure positive terminal precipitate form , may 
wrong . 
oh well , corroded battery , feel 
like think right . 
important notice reaction , know would , 
exothermic , energy discharging . 
moisture dissolve electrolyte 
acid rain condense battery , conductive path terminal 
may form . 
discharge battery chemical reaction proceeds . 
reaction reversible , electricity alternator battery 
charger put back battery . 
lead-acid battery must change chemical composition discharge . 

cell reactant necessary reaction . 
post 
terminal lead-acid battery remove add electric 
energy discharge charge . 
reaction exothermic , 
tendency happen , though quite slowly normal circumstance . 

keep battery dry good idea , total solution . 
understand lead-acid battery indeed discharge faster store 
concrete oppose wood earth dirt , one recall 's 
principle , paraphrase : anything subject stress 
act move comfortable position . 
thermal conductivity

note thermal conductivity `` dirt '' diatomaceous earth go 
temperature . 
also , 204 c 400 k , value earth powder 
order magnitude natural earth . 
thermal conductivity 
concrete around factor 10 greater dirt , 2-4 
time greater wood . 
difference thermal conductivity cause battery 
concrete discharge faster dirt wood . 
instant 
discharge reaction occur , energy release , either electricity 
heat . 
thermal conductivity air 0.015 btu . 
storage , except trickle pass condensate 
battery , energy mostly release heat . 
higher conductivity 
surface remove heat proportionately faster lower conductivity 
surface . 
thus , perfectly insulate dry battery bottom 
surface , give battery temperature storage surface temperature , 
battery concrete surface discharge 10 time faster 
dirt . 
's principle come play . 
remove energy 
exothermic reaction drive reaction completion . 

reaction normally occur room temperature , keep battery 
temperature require removal heat produce . 
concrete surface 
better heat sink dirt wood surface . 
store battery corner 
pour concrete basement , 3 surface remove energy , 
`` pull '' reaction along . 
also , water evaporate battery , elevate ratio sulfuric 
acid water . 
tend drive discharge reaction .
