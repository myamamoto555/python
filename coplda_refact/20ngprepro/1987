suppose soviets manage get moon rocket work 
make first . 
could beat either : 
rocket blow pad thus set back , 

saturn v go boom . 
beat , speculate us would go 
head landing , also would 
determine set base earth orbit 
moon . 
whether would mars would depend 
upon whether soviets try go . 
set lunar base 
would stretch budget nation think 
military value lunar base would outweigh value 
go mars least short run . 
thus would 
concentrate moon .
