first , think argue straw man , 
think anyone argue quackery , pseudo-science , 
homeopathy , , traditional chinese medicine 
accept science . 
, particular , think basic idea 
homeopathy seem extremely flaky . 
believe , however , thing 
include flaky idea deserving serious scientific 
attention . 
fact true , state , 
use currently fashionable methodology idea 
effective , science today would exist . 

current science base past work scientist whose 
methodology , current standard , seriously flaw . 
certainly true methodology improve , need re-examine 
result derive past use less perfect methodology . 

also true result obtain people today still rely 
early methodology need re-examine rigorous 
fashion qualify credibly . 
say nobody fail elaborate double-blind study 
capable know ass hole ground say 
idea come outside scientific establishment could possibly 
worthy serious investigation ... truly mark one 's attitude 
doctrinaire , cultist . 
attitude compatible belief 
reason . 
-- 
argument behaviorist , psychology seem 
less like science collection compete religious sect .
