law much worse worthless . 
give police power put 
innocent people jail police find something 
understand . 
police know return key , never mind 
difference core file classify military secret . 
plenty scenario user would idea something 
either . 
could uninitialized junk . 
burden proof 
user show something normal upstanding citizen . 

one ever put situation , especially america . 
disgust easily people go along , 
provide bargaining chip hypothetical allege child molester 
drug dealer , whatever bad thing style time . 
basically 
people clear distinction criminal suspect . 
analogy , like find loose screw house , 
insist build bomb machine gun . 
ask come 
like would know , ask prove claim . 
explain 
simple term , people may start get idea . 
matter fact , keep random file disk . 
reason , 
without special-purpose hardware , take long time generate good random 
bit . 
program crank couple bit per minute , 
pretty conservative , time need . 
think , point actually encrypt random datum , 
give different random datum . 
want datum 
look like encrypted file , put appropriate header . 

enough people , put jail . 
get arrest police ask key , tell 
random junk , although course believe . 
` re 
sit jail , take consolation fact government 
burn try find something .
