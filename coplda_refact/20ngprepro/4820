purpose contest , would bet thing could cut . 
like fuel 
re-entry , kind heat shield , etc. , etc. . 
even still , 
contest participant fund development , probably would 
worth develop contest . 
give cheapest 
heaviest lift man rate least 6 g booster ... 
pay development , great ! 
, 'll use . 
back contest goal , recent article 
low cost relative ... man return moon . 
general 
dynamics scheme involve titan iv & shuttle lift centaur upper 
stage , lev , crew capsule . 
mission consist deliver two 
unmanned payload lunar surface , follow manned mission . 
total cost : us $ 10 - $ 13 billion . 
joint esa ? 
nasa project $ 6 - $ 9 
billion us share . 
find mention long crew could stay , would bet 
around 30 day . 
total payload deliver 30 metric 
tonne . 
ignore scientific payload , hitch ride crew 
habitation module return trip ... , toss tonne 
additional consumable last another 11 month , might 
able get year visit 15 tonne case obvious , 
wild ass guess . 
pretty boring visit , since every trip outdoors 
eat bit lox . 
certain home brew 
life support system could last year . 
let 's round 
19.4 tonne , since gd plan talk 9.7 ton 
payload deliver lunar surface . 
add two centaurs , two 
lev , two shuttle flight ... put single man moon 
year . 
hmmm . 
really practical . 
anyone get way 
deliver 15-20 tonne lunar surface within decade ? 
anyone 
precise guess much year 's supply consumable 
equipment would weigh ? 
wonder gd lev . 
reusable ? 
discard 
burn return leo ? 
discard , could refuel ? 
henry : know anything gd lev ? 
note use 
engine . 
? 
would lev fit ? 
forget ever know cargo bay dimension 
. 
, certain single stay 
moon year wise useful . 
: prize first 
non-government unmanned moon landing , another man 
moon landing , yet another system extract consumable 
lunar soil , another reusable shuttle , forth . 
find 
way build civilian moonbase infrastructure ... single goal 
might result bunch give one person appear 
win . 
give , find something little scary 
half dozen people huddle rickety little moon shelter . 
would 
like see much reward co-operation competition . 
lastly , ten fifteen year back seem recall 
english space magazine on-going discussion moonbase 
cheap . 
recall discuss thing like much heat human 
body produce , much lunar material would need protection solar 
flare , etc. . 
unfortunately remember name magazine . 
ring bell anyone ?
