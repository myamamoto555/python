afraid discussion group contain people different 
view tend turn argument largest difference 
present . 
spend lot time 
argument , spend lot 
time argument among different christian group , bitnet 
catholic group spend lot time argument conservative 
liberal catholics . 
personally would prefer set 
somewhat specialized group , least alternative . 
liberal 
conservative protestant catholic would handle 
traffic , though certainly significant group e.g. 
orthodox . 
course may reader like 
argument . 
certainly find painful moderate .
