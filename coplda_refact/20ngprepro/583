. 
well , one reason get conflict answer depend 
want ground plane . 
continuous conductor good 
electrostatic shield . 
signal board need 
shield rom thing ? 
shield much good magnetic 
field , unless make continuous around circuit shield , 
like faraday cage . 
flip side coin : work high impedance , 
could end capacitance plane cause problem . 
likely encounter , , 
real problem one bite .
