, obviously talk research assistants . 
favor high protein , 
low fat diet , barely adequate salary fixed time schedule , four hour 
sleep night , continuous infusion latte , unpredictable praise 
mixed randomly , everpresent glance 
lowered eyebrow , unrealistic promise rapid publication , 
every three month dinner consist nothing microbrewery ale 
free pretzel . 
actually , mine hail san diego , indeed 
problem seattle cold weather warm .
