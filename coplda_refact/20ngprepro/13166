several problem . 
first , discuss 
experimental procedure . 
observational procedure also useful . 

main criterion attempt verify idea use make 
prediction as-yet unmade observation . 
observation could 
result experiment , could activity 
occur nature , could even observation 
lasting result event long past . 
matter 
observation new . 
prediction science - 

predict future except restricted 
sense . 
secondly , repeatability also take many form . 
really 

requirement independent observer able verify result . 

observation fossil ` repeatable ' , since qualify observer 
may 
look specimen museum . 
also , 
implicit prediction future fossil find 
correspond 
current one . 
new fossil find often enough 
test regularly . 
many time new fossil actually falsify 
conclusion make basis previous fossil . 
unfortunately , model falsify alway 
peripheral model evolution . 
instance , 
front leg tyrannosaurus rex turn tremendous muscle , 
rather weakly endowed previously believe . 
, fact , science finding repeatable 
necessary sense . 
becuase go repeat 
original 
event make impossible make valid observation . 
say biologist would go extra - 
terrestrial life discover - could make determination 
process abiogenesis relatively easy .
