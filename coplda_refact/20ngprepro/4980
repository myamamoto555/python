thousand ? 
ten thousand ? 
arithmetic , please ... skipjack 
2 ^ 80 possible key . 
let 's assume brute-force engine like 
hypothesize des : 1 microsecond per trial , 1 million chip . 

10 ^ 12 trial per second , 38,000 year 2 ^ 80 trial . 
well , 
maybe get chip run one trial per nanosecond , build 
machine 10 million chip . 
sure -- 3.8 year solution . 
idea use 128-bit key . 
shall bother calculation ? 
hint : multiply 3.8 year 2 ^ . 
idea 
speed ; key setup take much long . 
would surprise 
case skipjack , , though way know 
yet . 
des use xor feasible mid-70 's 
technology . 
modern chip lot . 
nsa may may know crack skipjack idea doubt 
former ; idea latter , though seem 
strong cryptosystem . 
gon na exhaustive search .
