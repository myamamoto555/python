sabo clearly better hitter samuel . 
yet would pinch-hit 
samuel predict samuel clutch hitter 
sabo choke hitter . 
right ? 
would call `` predict 
future '' .

correct ? 
right . 
would use aspect prior performance 
show consistent past . 
overall performance , split , 
even match style . 
give 
advantage use properly . 
even else equal , would advantage gain 
look past clutch performance . 
case , everything else 
pointed sabo .

perez leave sabo , 
predict future , next ab . 
predict 
sabo likely get hit samuel . 
support swap , predict opposite .

well , yes . 
aware existance . 
claim incapable 
understand though suspect simply unwilling . 
yet 
rather forcefully state opposite . 
seem think 
work worth reading yet obviously feel topic important . 
would say insulting .

right ! 
beef . 
prove indicator 
future performance circumstance . 
least none 
able come . 
know 
indicator future performance , please let secret . 
> nice , however , see consider possibility 
> actually could preconceived bias . 
certainly . 
repeatedly state , come 
study even hint consistent clutch ability , would 
love ! 
however straightforward attempt study 
fail miserably . 
yeah . 
hindsight always 20-20 . 
make bright ? 

stupid argument know .

well , stupid argument . 
honestly debate ??? 
sure , know sabo get hit . 
idea whether samuel 
would better . 
one ab certainly 
prove anything !

simply prediction chris sabo year ? 

prediction batter , past year , hit 
xxx amount ? 
worse clutch overall ? 
mean first , say , 'll wait 
see . 
second much stronger statement . 
fact , 
suggest rule . 
test rule past datum see 
work recent year . 
think agree rule 
work last year year , unlikely 
better year . 
right ?

go get case analysis . 
sure , find somebody 
hit poorly ' 89 - '91 hit poorly '92 well . 

also find hit poorly ' 89 - '91 hit well 
' 92 .

gambler 's fallacy . 
unless reason expect consistency , 
run prove nothing . 
give reason expect clutch ba 
correlate one year next ? 
see detailed study 
expect correlate .

hostility . 
`` stupid '' reference statement stupid . 

see deny . 
`` total idiot '' ? 
yes . 

prove unwilling even consider evidence might 
suggest wrong , would say term fit nicely .
