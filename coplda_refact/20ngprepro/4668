think problem pretty much ignore part 
jews sightseeing 2000 year , think instead 
important part original poster say bit 
kill palestinians . 
retrospect , see 
sightseeing thing would offensive many . 
originally see 
poetic license , understandable 
might see differently . 
still think ken come bit 
strong though . 
also think advice masud khan : 
argue someone like mr , good idea 
little homework , least think . 
unnecessary .

throughout article thread tacit 
assumption original poster exhibit casual 
anti-semitism . 
agree , maybe speech 
bad might relevant . 
think ` re 
read lot one flip sentence . 
probably 
true case , often charge anti-semitism get 
throw around order stifle legitimate criticism 
state israel . 
anyway , would rather somewhere else , outta thread .
