ok , ham . 
well , tune 10.7 mhz . 
number sound 
like herd ? 
thats right , guess , 
common number . 
every receiver local oscillator 
generate . 
detector detector detect 
local oscillator . 
two local oscillator generate way 
receiver . 
want receiver something say ghz must 
generate local oscillator signal ghz - 10.7 mhz local osc 
frequency . 
10.7 mhz feed normal agc . 
detector key agc voltage mileage may vary . 
since 
agc negative feed back device , positive voltage set ... 
think get picture .
