car accessory shop sell stuff call , fine 
cut paste paint , remove dull finish 
minor . 
also remove traffic film stuff 
probably realize , give paintwork original 
lustre shine . 
sometimes react badly metallic paint , though , 
try carefully go town stuff . 
afterwards 
apply wax polish , well . 
btw - confuse cut paste use grind 
valve ... principle 's coarseness vastly different ...
