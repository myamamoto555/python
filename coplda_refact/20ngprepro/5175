evidence ? 
code perfect , 
degrade ever since , _ _ evidence favor 
statement , ? 
perhaps biggest `` imperfection '' code full 
non-coding region , intron , call 
intervene code region exon . 
impressive amount 
evidence suggest intron ancient origin ; 
likely early exon represent early protein domain . 
number intron decrease increase ? 
appear 
intron loss occur , species common ancestry usually 
quite similar structure gene . 
hand , possibility intron insert 
later , present several logical difficulty . 
intron remove 
splicing mechanism - would present , unused , 
intron insert . 
moreover , intron insertion would 
require _ precise _ targeting - random insertion would tolerate , 
since sequence intron removal mrna 
conserve . 
besides , transposition sequence usually leave 
trace - long terminal repeat target - site duplication , 
find near intron sequence . 
seriously recommend read textbook molecular biology 
genetics post `` theological argument '' like . 
try watson 's molecular biology gene darnell , lodish 
& baltimore 's molecular biology cell starter . 
: remember , question pose theological context 
: god cause disease newborn ? 
, answer likewise 
: theological perspective -- . 
less valid purely 
: scientific perspective , different . 
scientific perspective support evidence , whereas 
theological perspective often fail fulfil criterion . 
: think misread meaning . 
say god make genetic code perfect , 
: mean perfect . 
certainly evolve since . 
worse ? 
would please cite reference support 
assertion ? 
assertion less valid scientific 
perspective , unless support evidence . 
fact , claim parasite disease perhaps 
important think - instance , sex might 
evolve defense parasite . 
view support 
computer simulation evolution , eg tierra . 
: perhaps . 
think higher energy ray like x-ray , gamma 
: ray , cosmic ray cause damage . 
fact , thermal energy damage , although 
usually mild easily fix enzymatic action . 
: actually , neither `` know '' atmosphere like 
: time god create life . 
accord recollection , 
: biologist claim life begin 4 billion year ago -- 
: , would half billion year earth 
: create . 
would still primitive support life . 

: seem remember figure like 2.5 3 billion year ago 
: origination life earth . 
anyone better estimate ? 
would replace `` create '' `` form '' , since need 
invoke creator earth form without one . 
recent estimate age earth range 4.6 - 4.8 
billion year , earliest sign life true fossil , 
organic , layer date back 3.5 billion year . 
would leave billion year first cell 
evolve . 
sorry give reference , base course 
evolutionary biochemistry attend . 
: dominion , great feat satan genetically engineer 
: disease , genetic . 
although force 
: natural selection tend improve survivability species , 
: degeneration genetic code tend offset . 
, _ want _ true , evidence 
suppose `` degeneration '' ? 
understand scott 's reaction : 
: > excuse , far-fetched know must 
: > jesting . 
know pathogen ? 
know 
: > point mutation ? 
know everything come 
: > spontaneously 
: 
: response last statement , , neither . 
: may well believe accept fact , 
: know . 
hope forget : _ evidence _ suggest 
everything come spontaneously . 
evidence 
conclusion ? 
science , one _ believe _ 
anything . 
healthy sign doubt disbelieve . 

right path walk take look evidence , 
present one 's conclusion prior . 
theology use method . 
therefore , seriously doubt 
could ever come right conclusion . 
: human dna , `` complex '' , tend accumulate error adversely 
: affect well-being ability fight disease , 
: simpler dna bacterium virus tend become efficient 
: cause infection disease . 
bad combination . 
hence 
: newborn suffer genetic , viral , bacterial 
: . 
suppose purpose , valid move . 
bacterium virus 
exist cause disease . 
another manifest 
general principle evolution - replication save replicator 
. 
efficient method dna 
survive replicate . 
less efficient method make 
present . 
last time . 
please present evidence claim 
human dna degrade evolutionary process . 
people 
claim opposite true - suppress selection , 
thus bind degrade . 
see much evidence either 
claim . 
: ask , ? 
relevant discussion 
: answer john 's question ? 
genetic disease , 
: many bacterial viral disease require 
: baby develop antibody . 
god 's fault ? 
original 
: question -- say , . 
course , nothing `` evil '' god 's fault . 
explanation 
work , fail miserably . 
: may right . 
fact know 
: satan responsible , neither i. 
: 
: suppose powerful , evil like satan exist . 
would 
: inconceivable might responsible many ill 
: affect mankind ? 
think . 
could much better job . 
pun intend . 
problem , 
seem satan necessary explain disease , 
inevitable product evolution . 
: say ? 
? 
seem like another bad inference . 
: actually oversimplify say 
: point summary word take new context . 

: never say people `` mean '' presumably god `` 
: punish get disease '' . 
say free moral 
: choice consequence . 
mankind choose reject 
: god , people since beginning , 
: expect god protect adverse event entropic 
: universe . 
expect . 
god exist , expect leave alone . 
would also like hear believe choice indeed 
free . 
interesting philosophical question , answer 
clear-cut seem . 
consequence would expect reject allah ? 
: oh , admit perfect yet . 
work . 
: 
good library bookstore good start point . 
: price tea china , 
: question provide answer ? 
biology genetics 
: fine subject important scientific endeavor . 
explain 
: god create set life process . 
explain 
: behind creation , life , subsequent evolution . 
`` behind '' ? 
proposition something 
support evidence . 
recommend 
book . 
need invoke behind , prime mover ? 
evidence 
? 
whole universe come existence without 
intervention , recent cosmological theory hawk et al 
suggest , people still insist ? 
: thanks scotty , fine sagely advice . 

: highly motivate learn detail 
: biology genetics , although sure would find 
: fascinating subject . 
realize detail 
: change big picture , god create life 
: begin ability change adapt 
: environment . 
sorry , . 
evidence big picture , 
need create anything capable adaptation . 
come existence without supreme . 
try reading p.w. atkins ' creation revisited freeman , 1992 .
