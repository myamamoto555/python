obviously . 
count rate low signal rise time long 
possible . 
, , , 10 meter long ? 
would 
need time accuracy nanosecond . 
actually measure relative strength 
detector also function photon energy . 

detector isotropic response . 
right one must 
model scattering photon material around detector , 
even scattering photon earth 's atmosphere back onto 
spacecraft . 
believe reduce error 2 
degree .
