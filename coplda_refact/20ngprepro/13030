think say . 
24 bit image 8 
bit many ` similar ' color map onto single palette color . 

color get modify fairly arbitrary way . 
want apply 
modification back 24 bit file , find color map 
one palette color . 
ok could copy 24 bit file 
32 bit file use extra 8 bit hold index entry . 
, need something ... , exactly ? 
apply difference rgb original modify palette entry 
color group ? 
could generate color rgb outside range 
0 ... 255 . 
would also lead discontinuity different part smooth 
color gradient map several different palette entry . 
could interpolate full modification modification depend 
far color palette entry . 
however suspect would look 
rather odd . 
summary , say previous post still hold : 
would suggest color editing 24 bit file ? 

would group ` related ' color edit together ? 
global 
change could unless software different 
much complicated . 
want color editing 24 bit image , need much 
software - readily available commercially . 
word , edit 24 bit file need software build job . 
tack mod onto xv go create problem solve . 
bit - seem claim bug xv . 

mean , :

yes , probably . 
find collect digest format post 
make little difficult understand precisely point . 
sorry 
misunderstand . 
> also miss wrong xv . 
however , write . 
yes . 
? 
wrong xv ?
