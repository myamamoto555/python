hope somebody would mention clutch . 
clutch ? 
baerga ? 

two word simply go together . 
runner score 
position , baerga bat .308 .366 .418 last year . 
quite 
suck , batter hit better situation . 
alomar ? 
hit .354 .439 .517 runner score position ! 
difference ? 
alomar 68 rbi 147 ab . 
baerga 81 
rbi 182 ab . 
baerga get 25 % chance , yet succeed 
20 % time . 
frankly , believe clutch . 
, vote would 
go alomar mvp let alone `` best 2b al '' .
