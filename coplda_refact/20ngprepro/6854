would doubt civil rights case would order point 
mention . 
even possible , think bad idea since smack 
real strongly double jeopardy . 
civil case damages fine since 
trial would proceed regardless first . 
think bad precedent 
already set king trial l.a. something like would

regardless bad anybody feel decision , 
must stand charge assault prove three 
marine stand . 
frank still mad , somewhat sane
