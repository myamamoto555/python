understand assumption something find 
carcinogenic `` would legal u.s. '' . 
think 
naturally occur substance exclude `` control '' substance 
pretty much unregulated term use food , food additive 
`` consumption '' . 
chemist concoct sp ? 

ingredient fall fda regulation . 
otherwise , 
really look closely would find reason ban almost everything . 
world suppose legal `` consume '' tobacco product 
probably ban ?
