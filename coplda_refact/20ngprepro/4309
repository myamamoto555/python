however , dust settle , go window , say temporary swap file right always , windows directory . 
question : come temporary swap file work ok compress drive , permanent one ? 
might want look window faq one , best 
explanation . 
guarantee way base ... 
swap file window talk 
directly hard disk controller card . 
controller card must 
use protocal set western digital something like . 
windows create file call window directory 
point file . 
use physical information 
disk index information file . 
compress disk actually `` logical '' disk . 
disk different 
characteristic actual physical disk . 
furthermore , information 
compress disk must use . 
i.e must 
go decompression program trap disk read operating 
system level bio level . 
`` inbetween '' program , window 
use direct method read `` logical '' disk . 
swap file `` reserve '' area disk 
window use block space dos . 
windows would theoretically 
even access file dos use disk space . 

know ... check somewhere everytime 
boot window . 
temporary swap file normal dos file access window 
via dos bio . 
disk compression program tsr load 
file access must go dos ... tsr 's disk compression ... bio 
order access . 
i.e. never use temporary swap file ... never 
swap file ... 
sure everyone uncompressed part compress hard disk 
see message `` select swap file greater suggest 
size ... window use size suggest ... wa create 
swap file anyway '' something like . 
well , friend mine robert call microsoft ask . 
say window check amount free disk space 
divide number 2 . 
check largest contiguous block 
free disk space . 
windows suggest smaller two number . 
also say absolutely circumstance ... none ! 
... window 
use swap file larger suggest size . 
well ... 
say ! 
call . 
true window report memory 
available go use ? 
taker ?

thanks
