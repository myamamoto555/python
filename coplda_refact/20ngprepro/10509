post text reply investigate context . 
first , `` ceremonial law '' term . 
sometimes 
use framework view scripture . 
look , 
without go assumption sabbath 
ceremonial law , see refer sabbath . 
paul write 2:14 -17 christ nail law 
cross , therefore judge 
food eat , drink , keep new moon holy day , 
keep sabbath . 
word sabbath verse `` '' use throughout 
new testament refer 7th day . 
scripture 
get idea ceremonial law , one , 
sabbath list among ceremonial law . 
one go fundamental assumption `` sabbath 
ceremonial law '' find way around , like 
say refer sabbath holy day besides 
7th day , `` sabbath ceremonial law . '' 

paul careful letter add kind 
statement anything see sin 
writings . 
also , sabbath absent epistle except hebrew 4 , 
talk rest come faith ? 
surely would 
big problem first century christian live society 
rest 7th day . 
especially slave . 
many new 
slave . 
would difficult slave rest sabbath 
mandatory . 
mention epistle ?
