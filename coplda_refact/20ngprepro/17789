opinion burzynski 's information current 
status research would appreciate . 
burzynski 's work promising . 
none a-1 a-5 
show antineoplastic effect 
experimental cancer . 
conduct test a-2 a-5 
leukemia mouse , result dose high enough produce 
toxic effect mouse effective inhibit growth 
tumor kill . 
1983 1985 
burzynski claim a-10 active factor common a-1 
a-5 something show , a-10 
extract a-2 . 
also show a-1 a-5 actually 
distinct substance . 
conduct series test use a-10 
standard panel tumor include different cell line 
tumor follow class : leukemia , 
small-cell lung cancer , colon cancer , cancer central nervous 
system , melanoma , ovarian cancer renal cancer . 
a-10 exhibit 
neither growth inhibition cytotoxicity dose level test . 
necessary process a-10 since soluble burzynski 's 
theory require soluble agent , basically 
pag call 2.5 . 
pag information carry 
peptide , something claim necessary 
antineoplastic activity . 
2.1 also derive a-10 4:1 
mixture pa pag . 
pa also peptide purchase 
chemical supply house $ 0.09 gram . 
a-10 chemically 
extremely similar thalidomide , 
habit form cause peripheral neuropathy . 
nasty effect 
thalidomide widely know . 
spite similarity , a-10 
appear test potential induce 
teratogenicity peripheral neuropathy . 
many burzynski 's statement origin theory , early 
research , past present support work 
show untrue .
