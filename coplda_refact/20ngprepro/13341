feel compel complain : statement recent observation 
rule merge neutron star source gamma-ray burst 
utterly false , even though popular enough make 
press release . 
idea behind statement follow : 
`` smack two neutron 
star together , neutron star gobble black hole , 
lot energy release , enough gamma-ray burst 
cosmological distance . 
, reasoning continue , energy 
release lot matter , radiation become 
expect see roughly blackbody spectrum . 
observe spectrum strongly non-thermal , model must 
wrong . '' 
often , fault lie imagination person 
try prove model wrong rather model . 

may initial energy release see gamma-ray 
burst , ` fireball ' energy matter create 
may spew relativistic flow . 
slam surround 
medium , strong flux non-thermal gamma ray result , may 
carry substantial fraction initial total energy . 

idea : series papers martin rees , 
peter meszaros sorry miss accent co-worker . 
certainly complete model , may well best one 
around sum propose distance scale . 
alternative 
proposal create initial fireball , way , 
so-called ` fail supernova ' scenario stan woosley , 
massive star end life collapse black 
hole . 
stellar core rotate , part infalling matter 
temporarily halt support centrifugal 
force , form dense neutron torus accrete onto 
black hole . 
beast may spew jet along rotation axis , 
constitute relativistic flow . 
rate 
event may much higher neutron star merger , 
flux may strongly beam , net rate 
burst observe earth stay two 
scenario , energy release per event lot less 
fail supernova scenario . 
another note : believe distance scale must 
ultimately resolve via classical astronomical method 
find counterpart burst wavelength , 
find definitive signature known class 
object distribution position flux . 
theorist 
historically find 
distance object prove one 
possible way object work , therefore 
must so-and-so .
