personally never forget mike schmidt 's home run 
expo 1980 decide nl east . 
also career high 
48th . 
another home run think totally incredible 
1986 alcs . 
ca angles boston red sox 1 strike away 
pennant baylor hit two strike pitch home run . 
incredible turn event ever see 
baseball . 
sox later take pennant away 
thing w mets . 
speak mets , 
strange nlc year astros almost 
mirror 1980 nlc phillies ?? 
astros 
painfully close twice must admit .
