remind shrapnel . 
consider 5 ' reasonable space 
limitation , make mistake gun blow hazard 
nearby , say next lane range . 
point 
distance , level threat , draw line . 

endangerment , 5 ' restriction , possibility 
shoot , hence draw 1.5 mile restriction , nuke 
draw 5 mile restriction ? 
al suffer fundamental 
flaw restrict base upon instrument rather place 
responsibility usage squarely upon shoulder user . 
perhaps sen. metzenbaum declare barrett light fifty assault 
rifle make apparent , since barrett 
range go .

disagree , grounds house rebuild much 
easily family die .

quite bit . 
personally , home worth , say , twenty martians

seem case already , give heavy 
weapon commonly citizenry . 
low 
number , obviously due cost , think superior 
weapon go great effect numerically 
superior foe . 
furthermore , even doubtful training 
include proper tactical movement best utilize tank , 
whereas commonly rifleman hamper effectiveness .

envision armorer , perhaps officer 
select group , like would exercise control 
heavier , complex weapon . 
, joe bob old sherman 
tank certainly would ask give . 
follow order 
officer , yes . 
since expense tank large , 
though , chance would jointly purchase 
therefore jointly maintain operate .

'll agree point . 
state control 
heavy weapon justification state 
centrally located . 
keep spread , 
ability state lock easy . 
otherwise , 
would assume state control would rest 
authority governor militia officer .

hard time see heavy weapon , 
fairly number , could easily wield 
people government support . 
argue 
weapon divvy democratic control 
one side , see 
situation alleviate select militia holding 
weapon unorganized militia infantry . 
think better mix call . 
, would argue 
federal army rely upon select militia 
unorganized militia bulk infantry unit .

assume would would 
side government-controlled force , 
equipment infantry force 3x size would trouble . 
would like see heavy stuff , say tank , offset 
local troup 105 's anti-tank weapon 
armory . 
would much useful infantry 
tank would cost training requirement figure . 
suppose quibble constitute heavy equipment . 
... mechanized infantry unit build 
dike time flood , set disaster relief city , 
like .

would , resource often available 
outfit local unit well enough . 
thus , certainly 
call , mechanized unit carry stuff faster 
anything else . 
> perhaps national guard close conception

perhaps idea heavy weapon different ? 
think 
main battle tank , self-propelled artillery , 155mm 
field piece heavy stuff . 
m113 troop carrier , ton 
truck , humvee 's , old m60 tank , 105 howitzer , stuff 
mechanized infantry . 
actually , guard unit 
iowa currently field unit . 
perhaps innate fear real heavy 
equipment state control , little number light 
stuff act deterrent . 
allow main battle tank 
state balance anti-tank capability local 
rank . 
similarly , local unit would need band together quickly , 
hence small fast response mean mechanized infantry . 
finally , 
militia fight . 
equipment need 
response . 
federal army , convinced , 
minumum infantry , rely state local militia 
function .
