one thing find interst pagan belief 
belief feminine deity well masculine deity . 

bring christian household , often wonder god 
father , mother ? 
everyone know father 
usually mother . 
seem rather unbalanced . 
fortunately , personal theology , probably 
fall line lot , recognize god 
without gender quality gender , 
masculine feminine force . 
provide sense balance find 
sorely lack theology , lack think responsible 
lot unbalanced way see world treat 
.
