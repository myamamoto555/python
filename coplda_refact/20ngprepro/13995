first thing ever try piece 
uscg nautical chart use adobe illustrator 3.2 . 
want get 
outline coast western long island sound . 
simultaneously 
suprise good job disappoint poorly . 

suspect give difficult thing ; coastline 
irregular , overlay chart numerous set 
longitude , loran grid well . 

common mistake make whenever coastline roughly parallel 
tangent grid line , would take follow instead 
coast . 
think best improvement would sort interactive 
algorithm would let step say `` , dummy , go 
wrong way '' . 
steve , friend mine year back , 
doctoral work analyze electron phage . 
good chunk work write program take digitized 
automatically trace centerline virus particle . 
essentially problem illustrator try solve 
tool . 
respects problem steve work harder , since 
try quantitative analysis virus structure find 
good centerline first step , step future 
analysis depend . 
however , respects , easier problem 
since program could write lot knowledge 
virus particle suppose look like , analysis could 
restricted particle happend relatively straight , 
clean , well image ; always freedom real 
life image . 
case , give insight difficult 
problem solve general case . 
steve longer . 
wife disappear 
vacation hawaii couple year graduate . 
last 
know location hike densely wood mountainous area . 

body ever find , presume victim 
sort fall accident wood .
