problem nihilistic approach , roger , take 
sense game . 
line reasoning , guy hit 
double play one basis load , point say 
bad thing team win anyway speculate 
might happen thing go otherwise , double 
play merely event happen course game 
eventually win lose unknown reason . 
, speculation 
involve construct fantasy would happen . 
roger , ever worry next pencil drop fall 
ceiling instead ? 
willing consider empirical evidence ? 
team go post-season win game anybody else 
division . 
make post-season , win 
series . 
agree win division useful intermediate 
goal ? 
, must agree win game useful intermediate goal 
towards win division , disagreement come consider 
win game . 
viewpoint express , win game happen reason 
analyze . 
many think thing like `` base - 
runner good , bad , therefore walk better 
double play basis load '' , think thing like 
`` team game , perhaps double play cause mysterious 
team dynamics cause team win today '' . 
result become impossible say anything individual 
player . 
perhaps atlanta would win series play leave 
field . 
, perhaps way knowledge personality would 
help team complete lack skill would hurt 
. 
therefore , could extremely valuable player . 
dave winfield 
anything jays ' victory ? 
probably , know ? 
replace andres galarraga , perhaps jays would win , 
perhaps would lose , perhaps would defect alpha 
centauri bear mind fly saucer would land 
mid-season winfield dhing toronto . 
babe ruth good player ? 
play team , 
anything success ? 
generally accept ernie banks good baseball player , 
jarvis brown dan . 
seem anybody 
would deny need provide proof . 
, observe thing baseball year , empirically 
look rulebook . 
necessary score run 
one 's opponent win game , would seem important score run 
prevent one 's opponent score . 
run score team 
batting , inning end third , would seem 
make bad hit home run good . 
player tendency 
hit pitch certain level , usually somewhat consistent 
year year . 
use statistics predict winner , . 
make 
flat prediction : barry bonds higher 
gene larkin year . 
braves finish ahead rockies 
standing . 
tigers score run royals , 
also give . 
would astonish turn 
false , , suspect , would . 
matter fact , 
pretty sure predict division winner year , give 
3-4 guess per division , certainly better random 
chance almost statistically significant . 
admit rockies mariners unlikely meet 
world series , must admit sort way measure 
likelihood , however fuzzy .

`` real life '' ? 
person rob service station two people 
, use .38 automatic pistol , get $ 42 , convict sentence 
three year . 
person b , similar criminal record , rob service 
station two people , use .38 revolver , get $ 42 , 
convict . 
since use two different type handgun , comparison 
totally meaningless ? 
say drop pencil see gravity still work cat always 
testing - trust pay gravity bill time . 

never drop pencil exact time century , 
previous evidence meaningless ? 
would surprise fly 
window instead hit desk ?
