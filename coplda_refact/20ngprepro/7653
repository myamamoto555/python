part , bunch bunk . 
get computer engineering 
degree , yet spend last 7 year write software people actually 
use . 
moreover , salary distinction incorrect ; receive 3 job offer 
upon graduation ; two job actually use hardware experience 
$ lower ! 
advice decide class project 
interest , pick major allow take .
