new scope think would save buck 
buy one function generator build . 
awhile 
notice two thing function generator . 
one , 
seem bias even ` ' push . 
, 
pull know adjust get signal san 
random bias . 
_ really _ annoying thing damn output 
go 1v . 
student may guess 
previous post , often measure input 
impedance various circuit circuit 
maximum input signal way less amplitude 
input impedance 10 's range . 
thing , order 
use function generator divide voltage thing 
reasonable . 
, course , input impedance 
circuit go throw another resistor series . 
output generator could ignore , 
little divider figure . 
kind 
pain ass . 
way could make little box could 
solve little problem . 
box would function generator 
input , lower voltage give output impedance 
low , unchanging number . 
would want lower voltage factor 
one hundred . 
could build little buffer amp , would 
like box active . 
quick idea . 
scope 's break . 
reason 
send shop get repair replace . 

function generator way one , . 
please help feel stupid 
today , 
dave
