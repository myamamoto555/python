ben , 
since obviously adept enough understand trackball work , 
thing short repair think thorough 
cleaning part , check proper placement 
little blue roller . 
since fix position 
stainless steel pin , might try slide slightly different 
position . 
powerbook 100 , slide almost completely 
contact trackball . 
fact , one note fix 
trackball advocate slide roller _ edge _ contact 
ball , center cylindrical area . 
, seem improve feel , 
need adjust time time . 
pop open one 
office 's , much latitude movement , one 
could still adjust roller slightly . 
might 
help . 
would suspect likely culprit slippery blue roller . 

take , clean mild soapy solution , isopropyl 
alcohol . 
also , sure ball . 
drop ball minus retain ring , roll ball see 
actually cause axle spin . 
still solve , maybe new one order . 
: - 
could electrical connection , case replacement would 
necessary . 
experience mouse trackball 
dirt normal problem , electrical malfunction . 
hope help ,
