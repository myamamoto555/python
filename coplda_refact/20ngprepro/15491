several reason difference . 
main reason 
good hitter prime frank thomas danny tartabull 
rarely regular dh 's , even field ; commonly 
place put age veteran . 
another use dh slot help player come back injury 
slowly , get bat lineup without force play 
field . 
would expect player hit worse dh 's 
rest season . 
third factor player split time dh first 
outfield hit well dh 's reason . 
reggie 
jackson good example ; five year angels , 
hit like old reggie right . 
second third factor lose player consider 
primary position ; player play 90 game right 60 
dh count right fielder ' average .

make sense ; might also look another way . 
although 
average offensive performance dh may lower left 
fielder , offensive performance certainly 
lower ; left fielder hit well enough keep job 
anywhere , certainly hit well enough keep job dh .
