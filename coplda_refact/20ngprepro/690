`` judge ye judge . '' 
strictly speak , right - repent _ _ somebody else , 
. 
guess think line talk 
generalize contribution participation 
`` sin society '' , tacit approval silence 
sinful attitude practice ... may also plain 
beg mercy , hope god withhold hand judgement 
whole country sake , much abraham seek 
sake lot . 
hmmm , result pretty cautionary ... 
time lately observe either out-and-out sinful 
activity , self-destructive activity , get strong 
impression many folk really know better . 
christ 's pity 
crowd `` like sheep without shepherd '' ring true . 
folk clue , bear _ _ responsibility 
communicate better way ? 
worse still ; express 
judgement disgust doings , thus alienate 
positive relationship whereby might pass along anything positive ? 
_ know _ get something repent score . 
anyway , real interesting question .
