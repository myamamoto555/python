may mixture say . 
sometimes israel choose 
target carefully . 
time send pilot 
sortie aim town general since know 
attacker come specific village 
intelligence . 
several occasion israel 
civilian refugee camp , even north lebanon , show 
sit idly soldier attack . 
time direct slum dirty work 
indiscriminately shell lebanese village side . 
experience shell several occasion , 
sla militia sometimes even despise 
israeli troops .

hope right israeli willingness withdraw , still 
contend withdrawal would better course israel 's 
security , since would reduce military loss , claim 
lebanese syrian gov ` would able prevent 
attack northern israel .

hmm ... disagree serve syria interest better . 
think syria want lebanon . 
would 
willing guarantee northern israel 's security return 
israeli withdrawal . 
think syria want israel 
involve protectorate lebanon . 
syria sit 
negotiate table come accept want 
get political resolution . 
renewal hostility 
along lebanese front could put whole peace negotiation 
back question .
