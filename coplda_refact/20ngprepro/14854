sure mean term `` bastard '' 
context . 
latter-day saints believe 
temple ordinance family unit may 
preserve eternity . 
use genealogical material software 
produce church , may notice section 
`` temple ordinance . '' 
within section 
spot signify `` bic '' 
stand `` bear covenant . '' 
child bear couple sealed married 
within temple `` bear covenant '' 
eligible part eternal 
family unit . 
child bear couple whether 
civil marriage would 
seal parent marriage 
solemnize eternity . 
suppose child bear woman 
wedlock , could seal 
parent later date adopt 
eternal family unit may include one 
birth parent .
