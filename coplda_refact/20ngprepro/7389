work 
dbase , foxpro , clipper file . 
however , feel microsoft 's odbc look promising . 
mostly formalisation building submit sql query , 
format query result . 
response say , available via ftp , 
except effectively without two manual : 
`` odbc programmer 's reference '' `` odbc sdk guide '' . 
moreover , 
odbc actually interpret sql database , 
driver provide database manufacturer . 
also , 
windows actually extension windows sdk . 
nevertheless , start sql interface standard , 
make life interesting future .

access paradox table . 
however , seem support 
c microsoft c. try compile 
engine 's sample application waterloo watcom + + 
32-bit compiler , complain library file 
miss even though quite certain file 
part watcom c engine . 
anybody success 
c compiler ? 

-------------------- 

currently develop app . 
borland 's `` paradox engine 
c '' also come pascal , recently go version 3.0 
i.e. , px engine 3.0 compatible paradox 4.0 , downward . 
.5 . 
indeed c lib fox access , think 
name offhand - sure someone already write regard - 
think see add fox lib `` c user journal '' , 
good place look type package general , way . 
pay due learn lot quirk px eng . 

past year - would recommend complex multiuser app . 
-- 
stay -- like bad marriage : get much time 
invest learning ! 
interest limit 
simple single-user interface want build sql engine , 
take , px engine job easily - sound like 
'll bump gotcha . 
, write ; may 
able point right direction .
