`` jubilee '' conference year pittsburgh pa , 
speaker speak well . 
talk many 
thing mention post , go little 
detail . 
'll paraphrase best : 
`` suppose part ` christian ' go 
tell people christ rise . 
never mind stoning , 
burn alive , possible crucifixion ... let 's talk 
scourging . 
whip would use would break pottery , metal , 
bone , anything else could find attach . 
would 
stand face wall , nothing protect . 
`` whip hit first time , would tear flesh 
instant incredibly intense pain . 
would think ` 
lie ? ' 
second hit would drop knee , would 
scream agony raw back tear . 
would 
say : ` lie ? ' 
37 come . 
`` third hit would scream lie , beg 
stop , tell would swear life 
lie , would stop ... '' 
amazing enough believe keep faith 
torture ... lie ? 
one fool enough ... 
one come forward . 
excellent post john , thanks take time .
