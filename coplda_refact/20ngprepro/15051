`` mothership '' except 
voyager style flyby mission . 
year ago , calculation 
`` grand tour '' space probe launch saturn v 1975-76 . 
time , feel 

idea big `` mother ship '' merit - voyagers rather 
small , lightweight craft due limitation impose use weak titan 
launcher . 
concept examine michael 's ? 
lot 
common british interplanetary society 's daedalus project send 
probe barnard 's star - i.e. large `` bus '' spacecraft carry several 
smaller probe dispatch ship arrive destination . 
saturn v supposedly would able launch 10-ton payload towards 
jupiter beyond . 
`` bus '' could include far powerful 
equipment powerful power 
source voyagers would limitation weight anymore . 
extremely important voyagers perform measurement 
within couple week planetary encounter , usually 
relatively great distance . 
-- 
smaller probe carry aboard might base `` real '' voyager , 
even smaller version like one schedule launch towards pluto 
early 21st century , would release various point 
mission . 
advantage obvious : bus would carry 
basic mission voyager 2 , 
addition two `` '' could saturn , examine 
planet 's south polar region move pluto . 
would 
enable nasa map hemisphere 1986 ... several 
probe could examine part neptune 
system examine great detail voyagers due 
factor . 
small `` swarm '' miniature space 
probe release month encounter would costly 
small mission entirely feasible launch heavy , 
well-equipped spacecraft . 
would learn lot outer 
planet ! 
reason grand tour cancel lack money , 
course .
