---------- 
yeah , might , read part quote . 
somehow leave 
part `` eat thing . '' 
change thing bit , eh ? 
complain people blame msg automatically , since unknown 
therefore must cause . 
equally unreasonable 
defend , automatically assume ca culprit . 
pepper make sneeze . 
affect way , fine . 
tell wrong say .
