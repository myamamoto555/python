university colorado space laboratory preston carter 
lawrence livermore national laboratory , `` environmental

meter . 
advertising carry mylar reflective area , 
deploy inflatable ` frame ' . 
help sell concept , spacecraft responsible 
maintain billboard orbit carry `` ozone reading 
sensor '' `` continuously monitor condition earth 's 
delicate protective ozone layer , '' accord mike lawson , head 
smi . 
furthermore , inflatable billboard reach minimum 
exposure 30 day release re-enter earth 's 
atmosphere . 
accord imi , `` biodegradable material burn , 
release component literally 
replenish ozone layer . '' 
remain spacecraft monitor 
atmosphere another year , , re-enter burn 
`` add ozone supply . '' 
would cheap advertisement , cost least several 
million dollar exact cost available . 
smi 
estimate market exposure would people 
watch superbowl , 30-second advertising ` unit ' cost 
$ 600,000 . 
since located atlanta , georgia , 
promote available time opening 1996 
summer olympics atlanta . 
back brian 's question : 
> anyone detail wn 
> news blip ? 
serious project ? 
`` wild 
> idea '' stage real funding ? 
see . 
serious -- get $ 15-20 m 
estimate $ 5-10 development cost flight unit , plus 
$ 10-15 m launch , probably real . 
claim 
tailor orbit overfly specific location specific time 
optimum advertising impact probably piggy back upon 
someone else 's plan launch buy dedicated 
launch . 
$ 10-15 m cost need raise , right . 
probably legal challenge 
well . 
note one potential legal challenge use 
launch vehicle advertising already . 
think 
legal challenge would win yes , amateur astronomer , 
, really like idea additional light 
pollution , know prohibition ... , legal 
challenge court fight would probably remove positive 
aspect advertising . 
imagine several way make 
advertiser look like lout -- would change 
positive market exposure negative market exposure , negate 
space advertising advantage . 
would spend $ 15 m look like 
idiot ? 
light pollution might bad -- low 
enough orbit , rely upon reflect light , would 
visible short time local dusk 
dawn . 
maximum market exposure , want visible 
dusk -- minimize impact astronomy , since time 
worse see due thermal turbulence . 
might still 
problem , perhaps way mitigate ... 
real funding -- none identify . 

60 expression interest make conestoga 
advertising opportunity , include curious folk 
$ 500,000 commitment . 
hear serious funding 
, sure shop venture around look 
money order flesh concept . 

confident firm pay customer time . 
anybody want , please 
guest . 
post privilege area least 
think ... .
