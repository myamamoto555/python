well , whipping , soon gx : 6 10 ^ 8 .5 
nanosecond resolution . 
hmm . 
'll rather difficult ! 
standard read : better method use ultrasound , generally 
somewhere around . 
sound travels heck lot slower light 
radio wave , therefore much easier deal . 
> frequency would best ? 
matter ? 
might easiest visit hardware store look numerous 
`` sonic estimator '' type device want . 
many pretty 
cheap -- < $ 30 . 
fact , awhile stanley estimator sell 
something like $ 8 . 
one buy !
