existence repeat earth life destiny karma 
mean everything happen predetermine past deed . 
oriental view tend direction , 
subscribe view . 
god may choose one individual 
another fit instrument plan , 
preclude development individual 
earthly life result longer course development . 
, rudolf steiner , subscribe oriental view 
inexorable , mechanistic karma determine everything 
befall one . 
kind shrivel caricature much greater 
law context deed christ golgotha 
ultimate salvation freedom human working 
christ see master theme , indeed , new impulse 
completely free karma . 
christ incarnate 
flesh , debt karma sin . 
oriental 
concept reincarnation karma , even trivialize 
mechanize new age teaching , incorrectly assume jesus 
christ reincarnation master . 
avatar , etc. . 
teaching reincarnation karma also concept 
continue individuality one life next e.g. buddhism . 
important , concept resurrection body , 
ultimate continuity whole human -- ultimate 
resurrection judgement last day . 
another biblical passage also bearing . 

tenth chapter john , devote almost entirely man bear blind . 
clearly , jesus tell disciple past karma 
parent lead blindness , rather 
new impulse reveal . 
note 
refute disciple ' question . 
fact , ask matter 
course , question state self evident 
one two possibility exist - either sin man 
, obviously incarnation , sin 
parent . 
fact even ask first possibility 
indicate awareness idea part form 
christ 's answer indicate disagree . 
also matthew 11:14 , jesus say straight john 
baptist , 
`` care accept , elias , come . '' 
also emphasize gospels positive teaching 
either way reincarnation -- , fact , happen 
human death last day . 
even jesus 
push teaching people ready embrace `` 
care accept '' . 
take care point , 
bible teach reincarnation deny either , 
much scripture fundamental christian doctrine become 
understandable reincarnation understand right way . 

pointedly use `` repeat earth life '' distinguish little 
oriental doctrine usually associate word `` reincarnation '' . 
phrase rudolf steiner 's . 
note 
idea need arise new insight west , completely 
free eastern tradition . 
eighteenth nineteenth 
century , important expression lessing 's `` 
education human race '' . 
return original point , paul 's statement jacob 
esau contradict idea repeat earth life karma . 
principle receive fulfillment 
incarnation , death , resurrection , ascension return jesus 
christ , view .
