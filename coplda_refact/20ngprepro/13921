unlikely . 
ammunition dangerous simply burn 
fire gun . 
brass case capable hold 
pressure generate burn powder , unless support 
wall gun barrel chamber simply split open . 

may cause small piece brass fly around , 
propel bullet significant velocity . 
fact , uncommon year past dispose old loaded 
cartridge burn . 
long close enough 
take piece fly brass eye , reasonably safe . 
thus , detonation loaded magazine loose round might cause 
slight injury would unlikely cause fatal bullet wound .
