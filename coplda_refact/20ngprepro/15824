article scratch surface security 
consideration , comment request . 
email : 
thanks people respond , usenet 
oracle corp. . 
common response suggest use oracle audit 
feature password control access opinion 
include suggestion use use . 
also advise 
use table view refine granularity access control . 
one important security consideration networked installation 
account presume client host provide user 
authentication . 
server user secure 
_ least _ secure machine network . 
hence probably 
define account system pc 's , limit access 
account datum security concern . 
unix oracle 
server provide disable access network 
option , rely host security local process . 
internally oracle provide powerful well document sic 
audit mechanism dba use monitor system 
datum access . 
tool use track primary security 
risk within oracle environment . 
oracle password security base proprietary usage des 
encryption . 
oracle corp. state algorithm prone 
attack . 
difficult claim substantiate 
since algorithm unknown . 
concern user 
choose easily guess password . 
_ _ cracker gain access 
oracle database file host operating system , 
could extract ` ' password datum apply 
cryptanalysis technique learn user password . 
security risk go , scenario pretty low severity . 
certainly intruder access raw database file , 
access datum . 
cracker _ could _ break 
password , however , could substantial damage without 
alert auditing mechanism 's , leave audit trail 
would point valid user . 
present oracle like unix 
provide native means ensure password 
. 
computer security , important defense 
educate user safe choice password . 
technique 
well discuss internet rfc # 1281 crack manual , 
available ftp archive server , unix r system
