people almost nonstop issue , constitutional limitation 
prevent ` majority ' . 
example , majority 
could vote give ethnic rights , people , etc. .

. 
government violation , around 
limitation government , probably know 
people would hard convince good intention behind 
tamper bill rights .

help sort line '' .

half truth , rig stats , government know control 
law effect crime .
