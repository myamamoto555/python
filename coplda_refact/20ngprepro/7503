1 output offset : obtain service manual oscilloscope 
adjust internal output offset . 
virtual 
certainty internal offset 
control 's zero detent position . 
2 verify function generator properly load . 
many 
generator expect supply 50 ohm load . 
go 
flea market scrounge around pass-through 50 ohm 
terminator male female bnc whatever connector 
. 
tektronix scope design put 
.4 v 1 meg load , .1 volt 50 ohm load . 
may 
also find load output function generator also 
reduce harmonic distortion . 
build attenuator . 
use would want 
use input impedance device test part 
voltage divider drop input test voltage . 
consider : 
------ 10k -------- + --------- ? 
ohm -- 
| 
gen 50 ohm 
load | 
+ ------------------- 
think ratio think accuracy 
read voltage oscilloscope . 

virtually discount loading also 
test generator want . 
good luck ,
