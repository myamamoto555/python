concern propose newsgroup split , personally favor 
. 
learn awful lot aspect graphic read 
group , code hardware algorithm . 
think make 5 
different group wate , result post 
week per group . 
kind like convenience one big forum 
discuss aspect graphic . 
anyone else feel way ? 
curious . 
disagree . 
could learn amount read 
split group , would make thing easier 
less omnivorous . 
`` waste '' create news 
group -- bit shuffling . 
problem 
post per week per group - spend much time 
.
