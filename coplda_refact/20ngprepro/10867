simplistic view safety . 
assume collision 
less likely agile smaller car , important factor 
well car sacrifice save . 
thousand 
pound f1 car hit wall 200 driver walk 
everybody die suburban hit wall 35 recall last 
generation suburban hic number . 
aside , point airbag ? 
seem 
seatbelt audi et al , good tight 5 point belt 
prevent every move far enough hit airbag . 
might 
save glass ? 
airbag lowest common denominator 
safety device use head collision 
wear seat belt ?
