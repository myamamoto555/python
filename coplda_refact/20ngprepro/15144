think concept amazing buy one . 
thing work read infrared emission ear drum . 
ear drum hotter ear canal wall , point 
thing carefully .

company inaccurate reading , someone company 
tell take great care clean window end 
probe alcohol time time .

read temperature , manage get reading within 0.5 degree 
oral temperature take home drive dr 's office . 
also notice tha nurse click button , remove 
probe immediately .
