anyone know cause , please let know . 
likely reason backup battery fail - battery 
maintain contents cmo memory ac power turn , 
battery flakey contents cmo lose 
checksum wrong along cmos datum . 
try 
replace battery . 
, however , pc use battery large capacitor power 
cmos , check see replace capacitor 
normal lithium battery . 
possible , make sure leave 
pc half hour hour day ; keep capacitor 
charge . 
would opt battery change , though . 
also possible , unlikely rogue problem even virus 
corrupt cmo . 
battery seem okay , get virus scanner 
check system .
