problem quadra 950 stump couple 
tech send vendor , well : - 
quadra ` stuff ' 64mb ram , 2mb vram large disk 
think . 
happen certain variable interval time 
video circuitry ` lose ' vertical sync . 
quite apparent 
mac cpu still ok , problem really seem lie video 
circuitry , since still save document , quit , 
even pull menu etc. display scroll lik crazy , 
pretty hard hit menu item ; - 
original logic board replace twice , problem 
occur board although occurrence 
vary . 
first board problem every 1hr , often 
cache turn yes . 
symptom 
obviously relate video circuitry cache cpu 
right ? 
. 
second board problem every 10 minute 
keep , rather put original back , current board 
problem lot less often go week without , 
twice within hour yesterday . 
technician come try figure seem pretty 
sharp try number sensible thing 
previously try anyway . 
include : 
- swap ram 
- swap vram 
- swap monitor 3 different 13 '' apple rgb 2 16 '' apple rgb 
- swap cable 
- disconnect hd boot floppy 
- sacrifice various small mammal 
fact : 
- put 32 nubus , problem fix 
occur internal video video 
- vendor reproduce problem back shop board 
exhibit lab 
- apple say get little bit piss ship board 
find anything wrong , get ship back 
faulty accord . 
speculation : 
- bet neither apple vendor test board 
much ram vram , may something 
finding hard reproduce problem though 
reproduce 4mb ram , probably red herring . 
- vendor 's representative blame ` metal wall ' - claim 
wall metal interfere mac 's operation .
