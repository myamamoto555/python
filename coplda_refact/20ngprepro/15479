probably help . 
would willing bet _ every _ manufacturer 
use little self-contained module . 
think sharp make . 
radio shack use sell buck maybe still . 
module 3 lead : power , ground demodulated output . 

contain , amplifier , integrator demodulator 
tiny metal . 
want buy one , try radio shack , else tv repair shop 
probably order one . 
btw - carrier frequency 40 khz , 
different manufacturer use unique pulse 
scheme perform different function equipment .
