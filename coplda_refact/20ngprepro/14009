sheesh ... .

temperature , karma . 
see , dirt good karma , 
since organic full live thing , cement square 
artificial look , lose karma process . 

karma sink , suck good karma battery 
longer able keep charge . 
wood also good organic , put 
board battery cement fix problem . 
buddha-nature acid , also lead plate . 

novice ask master whether spongy lead karma 
whether solid lead . 
master hand novice b battery , 
terminal downward , thus novice enlighten .
