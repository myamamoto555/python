crazy question : `` anyone ever wonder bird drop load car 
go 65 mph '' ? 

take non-stop trip , get shit four time every time hit 
windshield , even open sunroof ! 
guess conscientious bird ; 
go 75 mph . 


use '67 galaxie convertible , sit light wait 
turn green . 
turn green , hesitate little sleep 
guess bird bomb , land directly front eye 
level , guess bird miscalculate think go take 
right away . 
still try figure one get rear bumper 
well 
bird fly fancy acrobatics car 
decide drop one execute perfect loop ??
