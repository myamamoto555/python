usually miss point . 
aid neither spread sex 
necessarily spread sex . 
futher , point , important 
point , urge sex stronger fear aid . 
even 
stronger religious attempt channel forbid sex . 

consequence suppress sex worse consequence aids . 
please note idea everybody would end aid sex 
control completely counterfactual . 
since bring point , god evil ?
