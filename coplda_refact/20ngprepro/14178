curiously enough , subject occupy good bit prayer life 
recently . 
god 's experience time completely different , 
since within without . 
use word like `` foreknowledge '' 
`` predestination '' semantically incorrect come describe 
god 's perception action , , god , beginning , living , 
end life . 
sort . 
god , `` '' 
know , could `` foreknowledge '' life 
time could `` '' action . 
fact , since 
understanding thing tie linear experience time , 
would say impossible understand completely 
free interact god 's control universe .
