yow - get sleep brad ! 
mean people i.e. 
terrorist & drug-dealing warlord want communicate privacy 
prefer break house , kill kidnap , steal telephone , 
rather : 
- spend $ 15 k-mart buy new phone . 
- purchasing load phone black market flea market 
super market . 
- talk gasp face-to-face . 
- walk one million pay phone . 
- use messenger . 
- go effort think code phrase like `` 
blowout freeway today '' . 
look , system nothing threaten folk _ know _ ` re 
wiretap , since trivial find avenue communication ; 
would reason resort extreme measure , since plethora 
simple alternative easily available . 
among legitimate reason damn propose system , 
think need worry terrorist commie drug warlord thug 
murder family , kick dog leave toilet seat 
steal $ 15 telephone . 
system like urine testing : 
catch small number stupid people , effect `` bad 
guy '' least three neuron work unison wish subvert , 
penalize heavily cause subject .
