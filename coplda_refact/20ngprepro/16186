like order . 
pitcher walk clark 2 unlike last year . 
williams get better pitch hit bond loom 
on-deck circle . 
since matt terrible batting eye ,

bond get base , try steal 2nd 
drive single thompson , manwaring , clayton . 
bat bond slugger , want 
run `` catch steal '' could take 
big inning . 
also bond less need protection behind 
good base stealer walk potential double . 
draw back clark williams clog 
basis infront bond ... think problem 
giants glad see especially robby thompson get hot .
