like heart attack stroke . 
` vast ' probably loose term . 
approximately 1,000,000 americans 
use firearm year , 30 year period get roughly , since 
may 30 million americans experience 
use firearm self defense . 
yield 12 percent population . 
yes , know real rough estimate . 
closer 270 million , 
many minor include etc , thus percentage 
anything low . 
rate , minority group range usually refer 
` tiny ' minority , see part group 
refer ` vast ' majority . 
little work might 
support ` simple ' majority americans never use , display firearm . 
certainly talk ownership wrong . 
nearly half 
fellow citizen one firearm .
