originator :

organization : princeton university 
lines : 28 
something one discuss yet miss : 
fbi set wiretap court order hand . 
point access line detect 
serial number n. 
happen next , fbi simply ask key 
n , , since warrant issue line , fbi 
simply get ? 
multiple phone use 
house , fbi ask n1 , n2 , etc. . 
? 
exactly prevent fbi claim 
serial number , x , also use 
line get key x ? 
either second court order specific 
require see indication , 
fbi effectively ask pair key 
time , escrow key holder total fake . 
unrelated issue : phone always use 
clipper chip , go take 
place ?!
