freshman year 1987 , 
line make much sense -- people `` need '' gun 
able get , people `` need '' police 
elite . 
unfortunately , position highly emotional 
well thought-out . 
never stop think hci 's position 
basically say non-elite incompetent , 
folk ! 
second amendment absolutely nothing 
hunting `` legitimate '' use exclude overthrow tyrannical 
government defend police prove 
protect . 
> know end result , regardless intention , 
> much easier subdue population . 
> definitely motivation many power , wonder 
> degree plan vs dupe .

wonder . 
personally find argument effective 
emotional people .
