`` visualization '' stage circuit design right , 
wonder best way `` scale '' ac voltage use 8-bit 
digital word . 
thinking use common method send 
word adc compare ac voltage convert 
sawtooth wave get duty cycle . 
however , leary 
method require lot part , , importantly , b 
create lot interference switching entire ac line . 

realize correct filter could cancel interference , 
would require part boost price . 
someone mention see ic input 8 
bit datum directly scale ac voltage come on-chip . 
unfortunately , could remember chip number manufacturer ; 
anyone else hear chip , please e-mail . 
build project `` dimmer box '' light 
controller circuit important cost box remain 
low one dimmer require light user 
wish control well , channel , least . 
therefor , box 
cost $ 150 , doubt end user want dish $ 150 x 16 
$ 2400 sixteen channel ... something notice 
today 's dimmer box ; expensive ! 
anyway , help someone could offer either method 
easily info chip always 
preferred method ... greatly appreciate !
