call radar . 
well , actually quite . 
radar measure distance 
measure time require transmit signal , receive 
reflection target . 
radar generally use pulse , radio altimeters 
use either pulse modulate continuous-wave transmission . 
case 
latter , highly accurate distance measurement make . 
example , 
original bendix radio altimeter accurate foot 2500 
foot altitude . 
note , however different method measure poster 
originally ask . 
problem gain accurate measurement 
transmitter seperate receiver need highly accurate 
time base start receiver exact instant transmitter 
trigger . 
wire connect , since radio wave actually 
travel faster free-space air , case wire difference 
call velocity factor cable . 
need resort 
common automatically correct distance , etc. . 
something 
like pll connect gp receiver trick , trigger 
transmitter receiver simultaneously . 
sound expensive ? 
bad , 
plan spend buck equipment effort . 
go different method ? 
surveyors use system 
reflection time measure . 
try ? 
sound like something p.e. 
know anyway . 
seem able measure signal strength 
determine distance . 
would short distance 2000 ft , 
would need accuracy 6 inch , . 
actually highly inaccurate , since power output transmitter 
vary unit unit , variance antenna transmission 
line , receiver may also vary , unit unit , unit 
time . 
would need continuously calibrate entire system . 

radio altimeter also , since everything located 
one place , much easier . 
note especially time base 
r.a. receiver transmitter one unit also ...

nope . 
fm capture effect say strongest signal win . 
, unless 
two interfere signal seperate 3 db signal strength . 
one problem make altimeter inaccurate low altitude . 
signal bounce runway tend strong ... 
frequency would best ? 
matter ? 
high possible eliminate outside influence , also enhance 
attenuation multipath signal . 
radio altimeters typically use frequency 
around 4 ghz . 
hope help ...
