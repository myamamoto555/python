well

elisabeth , let 's set record straight nth time , read 
`` yeast connection '' . 
anything say due brainwash 
`` hate '' book . 
okay guess hate book , hate ? 
elisabeth , go quote zinsser 's microbiology , 20th edition . 
book familiar `` hate '' . 
`` candida species 
colonize mucosal surface human birth shortly 
thereafter . 
risk endogenous infection clearly ever present . 
indeed , candidiasis occur worldwide common systemic 
mycosis . '' 
neutrophil play main role prevent systemic 
infection candidiasis would low neutrophil count 
`` sick '' neutrophil see systemic infection . 
poor diet persistent 
parasitic infestation set many third world resident candidiasis . 
assessment candidiasis u.s. correct dispute 
. 
post discussion candida bloom , without systemic 
infection . 
bloom would responsible local site irritation 
gi tract , mouth , vagina sinus cavity . 
knock bacterial 
competition candida propose possible trigger candida 
bloom . 
let quote zinsser 's : `` however , factor , 
use broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic , may predispose 
mucosal systemic infection '' . 
address mucosal infection 
like term bloom better . 
nutrition course teach cover 
effect antibiotic treatment well `` cure '' . 
guess 
nutrition course , bad . 
brief primer yeast . 
yeast infection , commonly 
call , truely cause yeast . 
common organism responsible 
type infection candida actually 
fungus .

maybe

fungus infection ? 
maybe

, elisabeth , detect little steve dyer ? 

notice faculty rank , biochemist , microbiologist . 
candida fungus accord zinsser 's . 
, point 
, display dimorphism . 
capable produce yeast cell , 
true hypha . 
elisabeth , probably microbiologist 
make lot sense . 
biochemist , lot 
greek . 
call fungus , go ahead crucify . 
know elisabeth , still able figure small 
little organism like candida bring much hostility people 
sci . 
med . 
must get suck mud slinging . 
keep hope people take time think 
say , make sense . 
ask anyone buy 
`` yeast connection '' book know book , plain 
simple . 
honest , begin wish never 
write .
