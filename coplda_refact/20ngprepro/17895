sleep disturbance , antihistamine help induce sleep 
use intermittently ; lose sedative effect ` re 
use nightly basis . 
anticholinergic effect dry secretion , 
relaxing effect smooth muscle problematic people , 
glaucoma prostate enlargement . 
antihistamine like diphenhydramine benadryl doxylamine 
potent sedative useful occasionally . 

say less sedative , seem work 
well people . 
doxylamine long 
half-life compare diphenhydramine , may produce residual 
hangover `` drug '' feel next morning .
