actually slow system 
bus ide . 
must real nice get shaft $ 20 - $ 100 buck 
extra cost drive , pay another $ 200 - $ 300 controller . 
yeah , absolutely use vlb except video graphic . 
ide could possibly take advantage vlb , run 
8 mhz 16 bit . 
people forget ide specifically 
design interface directly isa bus ? 
see 
ides come eisa , xt isa , even mca , time 
16 bit standard , run somewhere near 8-10 mhz . 

run ide vlb , way run 
33 mhz , would burn . 
course go scsi , esdi , whatever , 
none run cpu speed . 
way gain advantage vlb ide hook 
caching controller . 
suspect would much , much better 
get software disk cache instead , since get well . 
> ide one make ide disk big . 
see fuji ide drive go high 1g .
