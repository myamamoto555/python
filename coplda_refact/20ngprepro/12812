know exact orbit number . 
ben say - idea news . 
know 
something ? 
please supply source - would nice 
scheduler observation know thing go 
. 
altitude number also way . 
best source : 
`` minimum st altitude pmdb : 573 kilometer '' 
`` maximum st altitude pmdb : 603 kilometer '' 
`` delta st altitude pmdb : 3 kilometer '' 
pmdb proposal management data base - use schedule observation .

hst light either .

could supply calculation ? 
might check recent 
posting explain ' small booster ' suggest 
exist , compare mass something 
exist mass oms fuel seem impossible . 
contamination 
threat also remain .

longer drag life understand , could explain 
antenna point ?

tell . 
although array move perfectly 
well utilize second electronics box . 
get work 
much desireable reclaim redundancy .

mean jump - helpful suggestion always welcome 
know idea better , want true 
situation describe clearly correctly , lest get 
confuse .
