nope . 
criminal stupid enough use new chip , 
'll use something secure . 
technology provide mean 
intercept phone conversation people stupid enough 
use .

order assess technology 
'll use different technology hide illegal 
activity . 
law-abiding citizen , trust 
government misuse ability decrypt conversation .

huh ?

short , new technology : 
1 protect law abide citizen 's privacy casual snooper . 
: 
1 protect government , decide misuse 
ability decrypt conversation . 
2 protect criminal succeed break new 
encryption scheme steal key , bribe people 
handle , etc. . 
3 prevent criminal use secure encryption 
communication .

since us government seem consider strong crypto munitions 
since us constitution guarantee right every american

bullshit . 
propose technology provide false sense security , 
encryption device built-in capability break 
encryption , prevent criminal use strong crypto , 
step outlaw strong crypto .

optimist believe new administration 
leave export control strong crypto device ? 
ok , american , business , could resist 
comment ... whole plot look ... 
, americans , fight rights .
