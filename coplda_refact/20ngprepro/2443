peter 3:7 
one interpretation hear verse refer sin 
physically abuse one 's wife . 
husband usually physically 
stronger wife permit use dominate . 
must honor sister christ . 
would therefore 
example specific sin block prayer . 
verse also make think kind husband decide 
god 's family without consult wife . 
god reveal 
husband wife . 
need 
degree mutuality decision making . 
even whose understanding 
bible lead belief authoritarian headship 
husband need incorporate order functional family . 
one way look god speak wife husband 
husband wife .
