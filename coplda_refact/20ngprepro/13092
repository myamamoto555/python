muslims know whole thing set destroy iraq , 
`` liberate kuwait '' , people kill invasion 
many many , one kill iraqis 
smaller invasion . 
live west , see 
media prepare helpless naive american war 
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
doubt plan exploit `` helpless naive americans '' 
purpose . 
hmm ... let 's see : 
iraq even artificial conflict iraq kuwait 
lead invasion , cia correctly predict pretend 
surprise know . 
happen saddam arrogant stupid . 
would : muslims would choose 300 dead kuwaitis 
200,000 dead iraqis 1000 dead kuwaitis . 
first case would happen 
western intervention happen , second case direct 
indirect result western . 
possibly , 200,000 iraqis indeed die , number base 
greenpeace estimate . 
greenpeace compromise allege 
impartiality war condemn potential environmental 
consequence allied action , initially completely 
ignore iraq 's horrible environmental crime , start dump 
million barrel oil gulf ahmadi blowing 
700 oil well . 
real number ? 
lot 
work last two year , none report 
greenpeace figure seem get continuously bandy . 
real 
number seem around 10,000 , order number 
kuwaitis kill , tortured kidnap occupation . 
` ve 
include article recently post , really old 
news . 
independent television news report figure around 15,000 
month war , hardly report . 
ally kill 200,000 iraqis , would 
kill twice total number iraqis kuwait . 
favored image hysteric last battle war 
' . 
yet another example american european media 
play hand iraq de facto ally . 

destruction iraqi convoy ' portray all-out 
slaughter . 
simply true . 
head tail convoy 
bomb initially , result lot casualty point . 
bomber come back , rest iraqi soldier flee 
foot . 
furthermore , estimate kuwaiti war dead ally invade 
completely ridiculous . 
acknowledge certainly implicitly 
saddam barbarous brute . 
acknowledge hundred 
thousand kill country . 
know man appoint governor kuwait , ali majid , 
brutal henchman , preside near genocide 
kurds late 80 's , recently , shi'a . 
yet , 
come treatment kuwaitis , angel . 
estimate , 
would kill fewer already war start . 
joke !

washington ap -- persian gulf war end , world 
tell 
many 100,000 iraqi soldier kill . 
one point , even baghdad put 
toll high , u.s. defense intelligence agency private . 
u.s. official backpedal ever since , even though 
pentagon yet settle official estimate release public . 
, one former dia analyst say number iraqi troops kill may 

low 1,500 . 
conclusion john , write current issue 
quarterly magazine foreign policy , represent lowest estimate yet 
u.s. 
defense source . 
revision suggest less devastating iraqi toll fit pattern 
vastly moderate u.s. military claim month war end . 
claim 
number u.s. weapon also scale . 
despite dramatic videotape successful weaponry shocking 
picture iraq 's disastrous retreat kuwait , argument continue 
unabated really happen gulf war . 
first question iraqi death toll number 
originally air . 
year ago , air force lt. gen. charles 
horner , 
commander air campaign gulf war , say believe iraqi 
military death toll fewer 10,000 entire war . 
pentagon still refuse provide estimate number 
iraqis die 42-day war u.s.-led coalition 
january 
february 1991 . 
monday , pentagon spokesman lt. cmdr. joe 
reiterate 
past statement `` number , '' credible . 
current internal estimate range 8,000 25,000 iraqi troops 
kill , say one analyst , speak condition anonymity , familiar 
pentagon 's report . 
allied death put 146 americans , 35 friendly fire ; 24 british , 9 
american fire ; 2 frenchman , 1 italian 39 among various arab ally . 
postwar reassessment , widely publicize army 's 
reluctant acknowledgement , month later , tout patriot air defense 
system nowhere near effective claim iraq 's scud missile . 
bush administration initially claim almost perfect record 
patriot ; last spring revise hit ratio 60 percent . 
success record navy 's tomahawk high-tech cruise missile use 
target baghdad part iraq also turn 
modest initially indicate pentagon . 
first iraqi casualty figure surface war come 
may 1991 
report environmental group greenpeace , say 100,000 120,000 
iraqi soldier kill . 
estimate 5,000 15,000 iraqi civilian 
also kill . 
month , publish report say defense intelligence agency 
estimate 100,000 iraqi soldier kill 300,000 wound 
air 
ground campaign -- although agency qualify say estimate 
could much 50 percent either direction . 
information become available , figure gradually 
revise downward . 
house armed services committee staff estimate 9,000 dead 17,000 
wound review last year . 
, write current issue quarterly foreign 
policy , 
estimate total death toll air ground offensive 
low 
1,500 -- 3,000 wound . 
base conclusion article number 
body find 
bury u.s. troops -- 577 -- prisoner war interview . 
note 
2,000 69,000 iraqi prisoner war wound . 
base calculation half many wound escape 
capture , put number wound 3,000 . 
use conservative 
ratio one dead two wound , applicable third world army like 
iraq , 
set battlefield death 1,500 . 
`` maybe figure low , '' write . 
`` maybe real death toll 

battlefield 2,000 3,000 even 6,000 . 
even , evidence 
suggest 
death toll well 100,000 -- even 10,000 . '' 
interview , say 100,000 figure obviously base 

would mean virtually iraqi soldier kuwait theater 
operation casualty . 
say today 's bloodiest war fight high technology , 
rather drawn-out conflict yugoslavia somalia .
