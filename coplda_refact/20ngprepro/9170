problem precisely define , need find 
smallest convex polygon enclose give polygon , 
seek convex hull original polygon . 

two way : use somewhat tricky well 
examine algorithm exploit polygon boundary , 
feed vertex original polygon convex hull 
routine accept o n log n . 
method discuss 
shamos , example .
