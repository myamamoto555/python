anyone know ? 
every aircraft flight constraint . 

graph , define ` flight envelope ' aircraft , 
presumably name graph line enclose envelope 
area graph represent condition aircraft 
fall sky . 
hence , ` push envelope ' become 
` operating beyond edge flight operational 
envelope ' . 
note envelope precisely know someone actually 
fly airplane region -- point , 
theoretical prediction . 
hence , one thing test pilot 
living ` push envelope ' find close 
correspondence paper airplane metal one -- 
essence , ` push back ' edge theoretical envelope 
airplane actually start fail fly . 
note , , 
quite calculated careful way ; flight test generally 
carefully go ` push ' 
far precisely plan despite occasional deviation plan , 
` early ' first flight f-16 high-speed 
taxi test . 
sure mary tell everything ever want know
