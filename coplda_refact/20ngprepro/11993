bullshit . 
deir yassin unprovoked attack 
part jews , massacre define best 
opinion . 
village deir yassin pact 
jews , peace pact , irgun purposely break 
agreement order scare palestinians . 
might 
grant village house armed arabs doubt 
nothing archive available literature indicate 
motivate force amongst irgun . 
deir yassin 
massacre part strategy intimidate 
palestinians flee jewish , ... contrary 
belief , many civilian kill . 
deir yassin later 
jews perpetrate 
useful get many palestinians leave . 
palestinians 
rightfully scare , want another 
deir yassin . 
necessarily condemn israelites ; 
atrocity aslo commit part arabs . 
careful think 
good guy middle east . 
arab jew 
suck equally .
