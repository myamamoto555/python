well , one thing poke around terminal power amp 
chip . 
use probe 10m resistor like scope probe connect 
input small audio amp . 
find input 
chip , one chip bad probably replace pretty easily . 
want pick signal , suitable feed 
outboard amp , outer leg volume control pot often good 
enough . 
volume control usually tone 
balance control . 
take center ground leg 
volume pot , volume control , probably 
control . 
unit modern type electronic volume control chip , 
probably forget whole thing .
