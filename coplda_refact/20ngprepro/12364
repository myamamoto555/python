god seem upset priest make 
difference holy profane . 
bring mind 
sermon hear recently speaker say `` god 's second name 
begin d '' refer , believe , use god 's holy name 
title swear word . 
also remind experience mose 
burning bush god tell `` take sandal , place 
stand holy ground . '' 
text seem imply god 's people must treat holy 
thing differently `` common '' thing , `` make difference '' 
holy common thing . 
obvious question 
make something holy ? 
christian primarily suppose 
make difference holy common thing ? 
e.g. god 's name , 
holy spirit , holy bible , etc. .
