bad question : ref list algorithm 
either . 
think bit , hard . 
1 take three point find plane define well 
circle lie say algorithm already 
2 find center circle . 
line pass center 
perpendicular plane three point pass center 
sphere . 
3 repeat unused point two original point . 

give two different line pass sphere 's 
origin . 
center sphere . 
4 radius easy compute , distance center 
original point . 
'll leave math , workable algorithm . 
: - 
alternate method would take pair point : plane form 
perpendicular bisector line segment pair also contain 
center sphere . 
three pair form three plane , intersect 
point . 
might easier implement .
