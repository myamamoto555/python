`` question arise begin think logo inner 
consciousness compose . 
need clarify two nature christ 
briefly . 
divine nature , exist eternally , undertake 
essential change incarnation would cause conflict 
attribute god , foremost immutability . 
would 
mean remain impassable , , incapable suffer death , 
free ignorance weakness temptation . 
realm 
divine nature better say son god become 
. 
result incarnation 
divine logo could ignorant weak , could tempt suffer die , 
divine nature , derivation possession human 
nature . 
would mean property divine nature 
human nature property person , therefore ascribe 
person . 
reason say person omnipotent , 
omniscient , omnipresent , yet time also man limited 
power , knowledge , man sorrow , subject human want misery . 

, however , penetration one nature . 
deity 
share imperfection humanity humanity share essential 
perfection godhead . 
assume double personality due 
possession double nature . 
christ 's human nature impersonal , 
attain self-consciousness self-determination personality 
. 
must differentiate person nature 
man . 
nature define : 
`` distinguish quality property something ; fundamental 
character , disposition temperament living , innate 
unchangeable . '' 
nature , essence , substance possess common , 
trinity one nature . 
also common nature mankind . 
personality , hand , separate subsistence nature , 
power consciousness . 
reason human nature 
christ , ever , separate subsistence , impersonal . 
logo , , represent principle personality . 
equally 
important see self-consciousness self-determination , 
, belong nature . 
reason justifiably say 
jesus two consciousness two , rather one . 

, activity one personality unite 
human divine nature , neither consciousness 
simply human simply divine . '' 
quotation give identify , entirely 
clear position loren take . 
clarity , 
let note view express one classic 
christological heresy -- monothelitism . 
position 
christ 's two nature complete , one 
. 
case think include example , 
human regard miss . 
normally people talk christ 's human nature 
`` impersonal '' mean somewhat abstract sense . 
, 
use `` person '' , usual english sense 
personality . 
use , doctrine call `` '' . 
personally think sophisticated way 
deny logos take humanity fully . 
however never 
formally rule heresy , fact hold influential 
theologian ancient modern e.g. athanasius . 

quotation appear go farther even athanasius go , 
realm overtly heretical .
