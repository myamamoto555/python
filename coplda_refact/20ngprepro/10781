6 copy text act include 
one vaticanus pretty closely shorter 
alexandrian version . 
longer version refer 
usually call `` western '' version main witness codex 
beza althought rather fragmentary source .

text edit westcott hort typical alexandrian text contain 
word ; i.e. difference % . 
8 answer obvious question , , major revelation 
longer text major omission shorter text . 
main 
difference seem `` expansion '' detail western text , 
prefer `` contraction '' alexandrian . 
western text seem 
give detail . 
interesting specific 
case , probably place go detail . 
9 discussion year version 
authentic hot heavy .

approach modern consensus neither text represent 
purely `` authentic '' version , ii variant reading 
examine merit however , iii variant 
alexandrian text `` better '' often .
