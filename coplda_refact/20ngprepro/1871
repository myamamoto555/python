oddly enough , german emigre , 
turkey , seem think badly germany . 
regard 
german jews , join 
anti-nazi activity local turkish jewish community . 

even find letter nazi representative turkey 
praise german jewish refugee work promote 
idea german culture . 
even though people 
persecute nazis rescue turks , share 
nazis ' feeling aryan racial superiority turks . 

second part book deal holocaust , begin 
1940 nazis occupy france . 
europe time , 
especially france , 20,000 turkish jews . 

migrate europe various reason turn 
century onward . 
settle europe 
turkish war independence world war , greece 
threaten overrun turkey . 
greeks persecute jews 
throughout nineteenth century , jews fear might 
happen greeks take turkey . 
many jews flee 
france 1920s 1930s . 
many also abandon 
turkish citizenship become french citizen . 
suddenly 
nazis invade france 1940 start introduce sort 
anti-jewish law . 
turkish jews soon find 
worth much french jew , worth lot 
turkish jew . 
- ? 
turkey remain neutral world war ii . 
retain 
embassy consulate nazi-occupied country 
finally enter war side ally 
end 1944 . 
war , therefore , turkey position 
defend citizen anti-jewish measure , 
action turkish diplomat take form second chapter 
book . 
turkish diplomat station france 
particular intervene protect jew turkish citizenship 
nazis . 
turkish jews retain turkish 
citizenship , generally problem . 

arrest send concentration camp , turkish diplomat 
would communicate commander camp 
official say effect : `` people turkish citizen . 
. '' 
turkish jews would 
release . 
business confiscate , turkish 
diplomat would protest business would restore . 
nazis general want keep friendship turkey .

secure release turkish jews . 
time even board 
train haul turkish jews auschwitz extermination 
succeed get train . 
foreign jews 
send concentration camp place call drancy 
paris , intercession turkish 
consul take place . 
greater problem come turkish jews abandon 
turkish citizenship become french citizen . 

consul could declare people turkish citizen 
. 
book include photograph jews 
line front turkish consulate , either get 
passport return turkey get restoration 
turkish citizenship . 
bureaucratic matter , 
process application would take time . 
meantime

street almost nothing . 
nazis would even arrest 
radio telephone apartment , 
radio telephone forbid jews . 
take care 
former turkish jews , turkish diplomat invent 
document call , `` irregular fellow 
citizen . '' 
document say effect `` person former 
turkish citizen apply restoration 
turkish citizenship . 
meantime would appreciate 
would treat turkish citizen . '' 

diplomat write document turkish put seal 
. 
since nazis could read turkish , whole 
accept papers certificate citizenship . 

means , turkish diplomat able rescue many jews 
relinquish turkish citizenship . 
actually nazis two mind turkish defense 
jews . 
one hand nazi foreign ministry , want 
retain friendship turkey , favor accept 
intervention . 
hand , himmler eichmann want 
jews exterminate . 
time himmler eichmann able 
prevail turkish jews send auschwitz 
turkish consul could anything . 
- statistics many turkish jews rescue ? 
20,000 turkish jews europe world war 
ii , 10,000 live france . 

information section book relate situation 
france . 
publish letter turkish consul 
send nazi official letter come back 
reply . 
generally nazis say turkish consul would 
present document certify arrest individual 
turkish citizen , promise send france , 
nazis would release concentration camp . 
turkish 
consul also organize special train take turkish jew 
nazi-occupied territory back turkey . 
train run 
regularly 1943 1944 . 
nazis give turkish jews visa 
could pass nazi territory , train 
often hold government eastern 
europe - croatia , serbia , bulgaria - 
government really want jews escape . 
result 
turkish consul ' effort , 3,000 4,000 turkish

intervention behalf turkish jews , turks cite 
treaty germany state turkish citizen german 
territory would treat german citizen turkey . 
basis turks maintain nazis could 
discriminate turkish citizen jews . 
nazis 
claim vichy government agree 
discriminate treat jews equally . 
turkey protest , say , `` divide citizen 
accord religion , turkish constitution require 
citizen treat equally , regardless religion . 
therefore , single turkish jews . '' 
american consul 
paris , contrast , accept nazi argument tell 
american jews persecute nazis 
could anything , american jews 
treat jews . 
third part book 
take place turkey , principal center 
holocaust activity aim rescue eastern european 
jews . 
agency , organization establish jews 
palestine help resettle jews palestine , set office 
istanbul 1940 leadership chaim barlas . 

jewish organization palestine , especially kibbutz , also 
send representative istanbul set headquarters . 

group first try contact jews eastern europe find 
happen . 
today know holocaust , 
time people know go . 

imagine nazis could thing . 

first step get information , turkish government let 
use turkish mail send letter relative 
friend eastern europe . 
jewish organization find 
happen receive reply . 
later 
nazis begin intercept letter , jews receive 
assistance also vatican nuncio , angelo ,

whenever possible rescue agency arrange 
jews get eastern europe either train 
call orient express route istanbul , boat 
black sea istanbul . 
turkey eager refugee remain within 
border war , blockade 
suffer terrible shortage food clothing . 

government , therefore , facilitate movement 
non-turkish jewish refugee turkey palestine , either 
taurus express railroad mountain syria 
palestine , small boat across eastern mediterranean 
southern turkey palestine . 
effort bitterly 
oppose nazis , also british , 
want jewish immigration palestine 
fear would hurt relation arabs . 
british 
constantly pressure turkish government stop traffic 
send jews back . 
case turkish government , 
yield british pressure , send boat back . 

example , one incident , steamship struma , 700 
jewish refugee romania , send back turkish 
government result intervention british 
ambassador . 
ship sink soviet submarine , 
lose except one person . 
nevertheless , tell , turkish 
government allow fewer 100,000 eastern european jews 
pass turkish territory move palestine 
second world war . 
turkish authority also provide 
refugee facility money , give permission 
send money food country . 
- many jews pass turkey may still 
live israel . 
yes , child . 
let 's return moment 
first group , turkish jews come europe . 

go palestine ; stay turkey . 

non-turkish , eastern european jews pass turkey en 
route palestine . 
story interesting . 
- rescue obscurity . 
many study make holocaust , 
focus eastern european middle eastern jews .

study deal 
much smaller number people . 
try round 
picture , hope book persuade scholar 
undertake investigation history eastern jews . 
come number , german jews also relatively 
small number . 
million slay polish jews . 

rescue 100,000 eastern european jews may seem
