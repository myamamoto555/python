try explain marty clearly 
understand antibiotic exposure risk factor fungal infection 
- say bacterium prevent fungal infection . 
marty make sound like secret know 
biochemist . 
anyone treat urinary tract infection known 
. 
center liver transplant patient receive bowel 
decontamination direct retain `` good '' anaerobic flora attempt 
prevent fungal colonization soon-to-be high risk group . 
also 
use lactobacillus treat enteral nutrition associate diarrhea may 
part due alteration gut flora . 
however , part 
routine practice `` '' patient `` good '' bacterium 
antibiotic . 
see datum practice prevent treat 
fungal infection risk patient . 
whether `` logical 
extension '' available observation 'll leave 
base strong opinion argue speculation absence 
clinical trial . 
one place therapy describe treat particularly 
recalcitrant case c. difficile colitis fungal infection . 

case report use stool ie someone els enema repopulate 
patient flora .

seem like excellent argument ignore anecdotal

conclusion . 
woman presumed candidiasis 
hypersensitivity syndrome , nystatin reduce systemic 
psychological symptom significantly placebo . 
consequently , 
empirical recommendation long-term nystatin therapy 
woman appear unwarranted . 
trial address every issue raise , . 
jon 
surprise negative trial since use despite

maybe avoid

marty , also change terrain discussion empiric 
itraconazole undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis systemic 
hypersensitivity symptom syndrome yoghurt vitamin 
therapy undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome 
systemic symptom . 
significant difference cost 
risk two empiric therapeutic trial . 
talk `` real '' 
candida infection , whole `` yeast connection '' hypothesis , efficacy 
routine bacterial repopulation human , ability anecdotally 
effective therapy challenge negative randomized trial confirm 
etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc . 
seem 
focus disease , therapy , hypothesis discussion . 
lose !
