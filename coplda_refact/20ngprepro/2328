might good idea ... resolution request 0.3 mv 
order get pay , noise level better lower 
. 
kind hard noisy box like expect 
inside pc . 
pay $ $ $ pc card , test sampling low 
distortion sine wave think sine wave cd . 
digital 
domain ? 
possibly low thd source run digitize 
waveform fft transform take noise floor 
spectrum . 
give good indication design . 
test datum acquistion system design 
- get idea maxim datum sheet . 
live 14 bit resolution , would recommend look 
maxim . 
high speed complete 
sampling dsp interface . 
input range + - 5v 
use serial interface easily optically isolate 
computer major noise source analog design 
guide get show -100 db noise level . 
claim -77 db 
max -85 typ . 
thd . 
look pretty good $ 12 @ 1000 piece 
evaluation kit available . 
might want give nice folk 
call . 
fax : 
application assistance . 
assume build da write software . 
hey get free sample call 1-800 #

would recommend find resolution get 
system look noise level , otherwise might 
throw money .

elec. eng . 
grad . 
student 
connection maxim except general recommend 
company give sample student . 
feel 
deserve nice .
