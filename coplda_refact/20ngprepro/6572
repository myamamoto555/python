follow logical consequence 
use code design obscure 
easily breakable illegal , include 
use code word `` project p5 '' 
ii speak language english 
iii ever refer implicitly event know 
everyone , eg 
`` hi john .

shocking could happen country 
arrogance call free .

optional 
3 send random congressperson 
4 send random keystroke accross us boundary , 
keep spook busy try decode . 
5 write encryption algorithm . 
6 buy clipper product . 
p.s. work us government want sell 
overseas . 
, rather easy us interest decode , 
make perfect tool espionage ... lull 
anyone stupid enough buy false sense security .
