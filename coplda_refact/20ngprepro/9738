admit never actually see . 
experience , back young er foolish ... 
first bike use track extremely true . 
go highway , 
would set throttle tension screw enough hold gas 
steady , slide back seat lean backrest , ride 
without hand . 
need turn , would shift weight 
turn , lo behold , bike would turn , san touch bar ! 
grant , would turn fast , prove turn 
bike without countersteering , least term input 
bar normally associate countersteering . 
say , know many people think lean , 
input give bar totally unconscious . 
whereas 
may sufficient get road normal circumstance , 
possibly year stretch , think anybody argue 
preferable properly know manipulate bar 
turn , regardless want call . 
except maybe mr. sixsmith ... ; ^
