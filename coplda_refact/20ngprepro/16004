color gif would like archive much smaller 
size use grayscale palette 16 shades . 
quantization 16 gray 
introduce ugly band picture , nicely eliminate 
dither . 
use xv process image , 
would like automate procedure . 
problem xv think convert image automatically , 
obvious alternative even get close 
xv 's quality . 
apparently dither rgb , even though image 
grayscale . 
dither routine xv seem use natural image 
color dither . 
similar routine available 
public domain ? 
, ?
