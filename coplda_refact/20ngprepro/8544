explain detail , group consider 
heretical probably . 
chalcedon compromise two group , alexandrians 
antiochene . 
adopt language intend acceptable 
moderate camp , rule extreme . 
agree 
extreme heretical . 
however course 
complex politics time , appear people get 
reject intend heresy , simply use language 
understand even . 
seem 
joint compromise reason doctrine . 

group descend supposedly heretical camp . 

post discuss descendant alexandrians . 
also 
remain nestorian . 
like current so-called 
monophysite , reason believe current so-called 
nestorian heretical either . 
sheltered nestorius

heresy , fact seem follow moderate representative 
antiochene tradition .
