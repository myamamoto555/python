oh , start ... ok . 
first , solid ! 
good . 
want good player . 
solid one word use describe nice white guy really 
good baseball . 
think `` twg '' without cap . 
lose strategy say , `` solid guy , need improve . '' 
use four time paragraph , btw . 
experienced . 
might add , though , greg olson damon 
berryhill exactly carter fisk . 
olson play three year , 
berryhill five , although 90 91 wash . 
difference , 
, olson valle support cast . 
`` two big bat . '' 
hrm . 
like justice , find mr. gant 's trend disturbing . 
call one maybe . 
braves ' platoon ok , neither player 
value outside platoon . 
bream vs. lh hunter vs. rh 
awful . 
'll leave comment alone . 
pendleton waste 
much bandwidth already . 
cf platoon hit .300 , 'll retrace 
mr. 's midnight run forbes , live ny la. . 
get , mike ? 
cox call pitch , anyway ? 
> goodness .
