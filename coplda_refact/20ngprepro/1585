cough choke ?!? 
cop give ticket `` sound '' like 
speed would probably show court without lawyer simply 
`` sound '' like speeding ridiculous . 
find guilty 
would appeal show lawyer . 
cop one : 
car plane 
radar , lidar , electronic speed measure device 
pace 
within limit would go court . 
accept 
cop `` see '' go excessively fast like 25 + limit 
`` look like go 70 55 zone '' `` beyond 
reasonable doubt '' . 
grant may well lose case 70 55 measure 
eye ??? 
take court sure .
