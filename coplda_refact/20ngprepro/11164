well , detector need lead shield protect ,

actually , situation even worse . 
total mass 
pluto fast flyby spacecraft pound , 
support equipment like power communication . 
mass available 
instrument maybe 10 % . 
think fit ... 
actually , would need shield ? 
understanding 
mostly give detector directionality . 
point 
get one . 
sure burst detector 
fly deep-space mission weigh much . 
mind , probably still heavy -- pff people would put 
instrument first , mass spare .
