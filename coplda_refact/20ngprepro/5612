thing might interested know today 's risc 
processor . 
true fewer instruction , 
commonly know cause size executable 
swell , case performance similar larger application . 
compromise , many risc processor today actually cross 
reduce instruction set , complex one . 
say future cisc processor , intel 
certainly prove . 
want know , group ?
