apology ` ve 
see follow : 
explain position `` war drugs , '' offer : 
drug crime : new approach 
ken barnes 
give : 
1 . 
trade illegal drug responsible 
much crime afflict nation . 
2 . 
people want drug particularly people 
predispose addiction find way get 
, whether legally available . 
3 . 
despite current law enforcement effort , drug 
readily available want . 
4 . 
addiction drug , legal illegal , 
responsible significant drain productive 
resource country , occur variety 
way , baby 
unable learn , spread disease among 
addict , tragic consequence alcohol abuse 
tobacco smoking . 
5 . 
general economic principle government 
whatever subsidize get , 
whatever tax get less . 

effective confront nation 's drug problem , 
way must find utilize additional 
power government make drug dealing drug use 
less attractive . 
country 's current effort combat 
legal drug succeed respects , 
greater awareness health consequence 
smoking , program help 
reduce drunk driving , example , 
say `` war '' illegal drug . 
remain 
core group illegal drug user support 
international network smuggler , pusher , grower , 
processor , kingpin , gangster . 
network 
`` marketing activity , '' include drive - 
shooting , corrupt law enforcement authority , 
smuggling weapon , directly indirectly 
responsible large proportion crime 
commit country every day . 
clearly , illegal drug rise crime 
link . 
take moment 's reflection 
recognize link . 
link money . 

country 's failed effort prohibit alcohol 
consumption , black market create , 
greedy local monopoly , like gangster 
bygone era , profit enormously 
illegal trade . 
victim trade include 
innocent people unfortunate enough 
catch crossfire , , would argue , drug 
user . 
black market , violent 
monopoly drug lord , drug user might 
thief , robber , prostitute murderer 
become order pay high price drug 
lord demand . 
absence drug lord , 
would , believe , simply people problem , 
either moral medical problem , 
criminal problem . 
let clear however , 
let criminal prey 
society many year prohibition 
hook . 
contrary , new approach advocate 
one would result either government 
private industry get business 
promote crack cocaine , presently 
illegal drug matter . 
neither 
approach see law abide citizen hand 
freedom privacy 
effort track illegal drug user , `` 
land free home brave '' look like 
police state . 
proposal : 
1 . 
possession use presently illegal 
drug decriminalize , buy sell 
remain illegal . 
` pothead ' grow 
marijuana many already today , drug user 
legally import poison choice long 
pay tariff , barter economy drug 
experimenter develop . 
2 . 
barter economy supply 
drug user , black market profit 
enriched drug lord dwindle . 
drug 
obtain ` free ' next nothing , buy 
? 
nevertheless , seek 
sell `` noncommercial '' drug even relatively 
low price . 
therefore , 
3 . 
law enforcement activity concentrate 
individual continue buy sell , 
also crime commit drug user poor 
afford even low price . 

strategy begin differentiate drug 
dealer , victimizer , drug user , 
victim . 
4 . 
upon arrest , _ suspect 
permit choose whether undergo 
drug test . 
choose cooperate inform 
upon conviction crime accuse 
, find drug user , 
institutionalize clean , 
begin serve sentence . 

choose cooperate already drug-free , 
begin serve sentence right away . 

choose undergo drug test 
convict face stiffer fine serve longer 
sentence . 
5 . 
institutionalization drug use criminal 
serve several purpose : 
drug use criminal include drunk 
` stone ' driver separate 
source supply , thus reduce total number 
drug user society large , consequently 
decrease demand drug street , put 
remain drug dealer business . 
institutionalization provide incentive 
drug use criminal straighten , 
become part general prison population . 
help protect society crime , 
institutionalization could also serve deter drug 
user become criminal , since drug use 
criminal , unlike criminal , would delay 
prior serve sentence additional 
time take sober . 
institutionalization drug use criminal 
separate general prison population would also 
provide closely monitored pool addict could 
volunteer research study new technique 
treatment addictive disease , potential 
benefit . 
6 . 
dealer illegal drug generally 
drug user , particularly true 
drug boss kingpin run large illicit 
organization . 
proposal , dealer would 
readily identifiable , since upon arrest 
would presumably pass drug test , else decline 
take order avoid explain 
possession drug apparent 
use . 
decline take test , 
would course face stiffer penalty . 

case attempted sale noncommercial drug 
would stand merit , outcome 
suspect 's drug test could provide additional 
evidence prosecution . 
7 . 
cigarette tax contribute 
decline smoking country make 
cigarette costly time 
provide revenue anti-smoking campaign , 
noncommercial drug tax , money 
generate use combat use . 
enforcement tax voluntary basis 
however , use excuse 
infringe rights privacy noncommercial 
drug user , since would effect 
reintroduce prohibition . 
instead , drug user encourage pay 
tax remind untaxed drug ever 
find possession course routine 
police operation , require pay 
tax immediately else forfeit untaxed drug 
destroy . 
drug dealer find sell 
noncommercial drug tax pay , 
face additional prosecution evade 
tax . 
strategy add tax evasion drug 
deal charge already use 
jurisdiction , effectiveness currently 
limit illegality drug possession . 
revenue drug possession tax import 
tariff would use fund anti-drug advertising 
campaign , provide support private sector drug 
treatment program unable afford 
treatment . 
8 . 
taxpayer subsidy drug producer must 
end . 
federal support tobacco farming 
immoral wasteful era tight budget , 
marijuana crop grow illicitly federal land 
many state must likewise eliminate . 
proposal would effect 
permit use illegal drug , 
would hold user drug responsible 
action , believe , would reduce harm 
drug society , particularly crime 
cause illegal drug trade . 
long 
remain free nation , relatively porous border , 
freedom citizen travel , always 
drug problem . 
whether take form 
heroin addict die abandon building , drunk 
driver kill maim street , 
emphysema patient struggle breath 
lifetime smoking , result : 
needless suffering death . 
society must 
recognize society permit harm 
drug , already 
regardless drug law , must take stand 
harm drug drug user cause 
. 
must particularly oppose vicious 
violent cartel prey weakness drug 
user . 
take profit deadly 
trade , proposal go long way towards shut 
powerful criminal organization . 
question whether drug use moral 
medical problem depend group drug user 
talk . 
different drug different 
effect , addictive . 

addictiveness drug also often vary 
individual , people drink 
alcohol moderation , find 
resist bottle . 
nicotine , former surgeon 
general c. everett koop declare addicting 
heroin , legal drug known harmful effect , 
people stop smoking willpower 
alone , continue smoke even treatment 
lung cancer . 
individual stop take drug 
, may argue 
choose use , represent moral failure 
part , unwillingness face 
difficulty life . 
addict , 
may choose use drug first time , 
time discover addiction late . 

hold responsible disease , 
would blame someone drown 
inability swim . 
perhaps know 
go near water , perhaps someone 
warn danger , present 
circumstance warning help . 
neither 
help drug dealer shore toss 
weight .
