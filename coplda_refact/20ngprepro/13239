ok , get big problem . 
world 
expect sell chip even $ 30 overhead involve 
programming procedure ? 
2-4 people , laptop , 300 chip 
time : give break . 
long take ? 
even 
minute per chip , take greater part day 
turn 300 thing . 
long suppose take 
program 10,000 chip mention ? 
highly impractical !
