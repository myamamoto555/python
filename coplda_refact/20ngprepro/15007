o.k. , 'll spell . 
`` barter economy '' mean 
drug user permit grow synthesize chemically 
anything choose , buy outside u.s. bring 
, grow . 
also permit 
trade drug user drug one 
grow manufacture . 
, however able 
legally sell drug money . 
manufacture 
importation noncommercial drug tax , discourage 
use . 
`` brain drug .

pardon , drug still crime ! 
rate drug user would seek 
treatment , comparative ease could 
make available today , drug illegal , 
would . 
decriminalize possession use make . 
drug dealer exploit weakness person 
prone addiction , , drug user 
left alone , throw prison along victimizer . 
criminal , treat . 
drug addiction absolve responsiblity

much big taste . 
drug test arrest suspect voluntary , coerce , 
therefore constitute violation amendment v. 
convict drug user , evidence test , 
need treatment problem . 
institutionalization 
criminal , would argue , best way 
help straighten . 
refuse test convict , 
sentence appropriately harsher , since , unlike 
addict , `` excuse '' crime .

? 
objective discourage drug 
behavior . 
fewer criminal drug fear get 
harsher sentence convict , good 
thing ? 
fewer drug dealer still criminal , btw 
find victim , good thing ? 
fewer drug 
user , drunk , ` pothead , ' etc. , commit crime 
fear cut source supply , 
good thing ? 
certainly willing debate position . 
read carefully though .
