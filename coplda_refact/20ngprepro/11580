first time take anyone extended ride 
read : farther around block . 
'll ride twisty , 
fairly bumpy road mines . 
hamilton loop sf bay . 
unless really adventurous , take route 
first extend ride ! 
kinda like take someone no-show 10-way 
speed star competition first skydive . 
person < 100 lb . 
fairly small , see weight much 
problem , sort advice give go ? 
want hold onto rather grab rail back , 
hear look shoulder direction ` re 
turn lean , else ? 
traditional 
1 ninja adjustable suspension , adjust stiffer 
set bottom bumpy curve . 
2 tell 3 cardinal rule : 
never ever ever ever put foot . 
stop stop 
sign , think gon na crash , never . 
keep 
peg tell get bike . 
b hold onto waist . 
hold tightly enough 
slide bike twist throttle bit . 

add bonus , keep close butt 
possible quick stop make slide knock 
ball onto gas tank . 
decide best word . 
c stay perpendicular bike ; straight seat . 

lean body curve , go bike stay perpendicular . 
look shoulder . 

3 remember time passenger back .

usual . 
aware jump brake , go 
equivalent 100 lb . 
dead weight crash behind , 
prepare . 
4 make sure piss ride even say 
go .

5 remind look around ride . 
point thing 
interest . 
make ride enjoyable get 
focus look back helmet , give 
ample excuse squeeze show see point . 
wife try `` look rider 's 
shoulder curve '' bit , work . 
timing 
weight shift unpredictable especially maxim , 
unlike ninja , upright ride position really restrict 
pillion 's view road ahead . 
next time remain 
perpendicular bike , could hardly tell someone 
else bike curve , weigh substantially 100 lb .
