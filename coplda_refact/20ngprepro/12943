bit surprise manual multimeter 
suggest apply wd-40 test lead socket , especially 
current range socket . 
intention prevent 
beeper go 
test lead socket . 
manual bit vague , think would apply wd-40 
swab , wipe socket instead spay stuff directly 
. 
speak say meter : compare 87 
bench almost 11 year . 
five year 
since calibrate . 
dc scale , agree 
within .01 mv . 
ac scale within .1 mv . 
87 would 
perfect portable meter db scale ; 
feel worth extra $ 100 second since 
use db much work .
