since mac use hard drive ye `` figure include

ok scsi spec list : 
chip synchronous range indeed 
asynchronous range slower s. 
controller chip : burst 8-bit 
note increase speed , mac quadra use version 
exist . 
pc use set . 
-1 mode : burst 
want want pay 16-bit 32-bit 
hardware mess software controller . 
usable 
device close 8-bit speed 
fast mode : burst 
fast : burst 
interface let speak : 
> ide range 0-8 .3 . 
synchronous asynchronous mode asynchronous much slower 
range

one problem use term ` ' article 
people . 
proper meaning `` set scsi interface compose 
'' 
look use scsi quote : 
comment 
pc magazine april 27 , `` although twice fast esdi , 
asynchronous chip 20 % faster ide ... '' 
asynchronous chip 8-bit 
read quote read : 
asynchronous chip 
`` although asynchronous twice fast esdi , one third 
speed ide ... '' 
asynchronous chip 8-bit 
`` although chip 8-bit eight time fast 
esdi , 20 % faster ide ... '' 
note nonuse ` scsi ' . 
eliminate . 
driver somewhat reasonable 16-bit 32-bit driver 
expansive 8-bit use driver little speed 
mac quadra exactly . 
continue thread state clearly scsi talk 

make difference .
