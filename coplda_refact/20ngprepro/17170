okay , part machine presumably part 
code number whatever program fixate 
upon go bad , replace part , program run 
`` different '' computer ??? 
, course , assume program use something rom like 
bios serial number , maybe ? 
disk-based code number . 
obviously drive go bad 'll reinstall stuff anyway . 
work computer lab part university system . 
wonderfully fun task maintain well hundred 
machine , pc macintosh , well administer network 
50 next machine . 
personally concern small lab 
ten pc 's ten mac 's . 
manager , help 
admin often . 
, copy-protection scheme sort nothing 
major headache legitimate user . 
anyone want copy 
program care legality get copy . 
period . 
`` pirate board '' pirate board . 
`` friend '' blatantly 
quite successfuly `` hack '' copy protection scheme practically 
sleep . 
let 's consider go lab . 
almost daily least one 
machine , sometimes several , due goofball screw 
set piece software . 
admittedly , student , 
mostly world 's efficient effective network 
administrator , try . 
keep even twenty machine 
partly responsibility even vaguely look `` act '' similar 
average user , maintain `` behind-the-scenes '' consistency 
real headache , bad headache try remember twenty 
different folder location norton utilities guy trash 
disk . 
often hardware problem peak `` business '' time 
get stuff work temporarily ... 
well , 'll cut chase quit boring y' ... . 
point , often software copy configuration 
file etc. machine machine . 
far easiest way find 
get one machine work exactly way want , 
copy complete setup machine nine 
machine 's type . 
ensure least ten minute 
ten identical machine work . 
network simplify 
considerably , major package wordperfect , windows , etc. 
network version thus one copy mess . 
often , however , need install package request instructor 
one , , machine special project . 

usually hand-written shareware , etc. program similar believe 
original poster ask . 
`` copy 
protection '' scheme cause nothing nightmare maintain 
. 
. 
short , waste time copy protection scheme . 
sort 
like outlaw gun . 
criminal get program anyway , 
hurt legitimate , honest user . 
write good user 's 
guide tech manual , whatever else program please 
regardless whether copy protect thing !!! 
, distribute 
manual license user . 
jack price cut loss , 
please take cue major company admittedly afford 
cost illegal copy far better burden 
legitimate user `` copy protection '' scheme ! 
sorry tirade , long day ... .
