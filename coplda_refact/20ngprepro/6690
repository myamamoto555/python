okay dod ` ers , goddamn mystery ya ! 
today turn 90 degree corner like day , 
slight difference - rough spot right path cause suspension 
compress mid corner part bike hit ground 
tangible `` thunk '' . 
pull first opportunity sus damage . 
bike kawasaki hinge spring 
fold upward backward contact ground etc. , 
lower extreme corner peg mount `` '' , 
little stud theoretically first bit hit ground 
100 % - bank turn . 
stud mount threaded bit 7 
mm long , screw threaded hole . 

mystery . 
stud side bike clunk turn absent . 

fairly sure event . 
damage end 
stud would ordinarily . 
fact , thread 
hole perfectly intact , evidence something 
forcefully rip moment previously . 
okay engineering type , f k explain ? 

rip tightly fitting steel thread threaded hole alloy without 
damage thread hole ? 
sort hi-tech design 
kawasaki never mention , like end suddenly 
change phase impact , let stud rip , change back solid 
? 
quite amaze could happen . 
meantime , life 
go , without left-hand .
