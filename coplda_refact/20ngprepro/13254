`` reasonable '' umpire would recognize ron gant 
disturb call . 
`` reasonable '' umpire would realize 
game progress , two ninth . 

ron gant try regain composure . 
`` normal '' baseball 
player would would get heated argument 
umpire , since argue ball strike , would 
eject game . 
ron gant , try avoid 
conflict , penalize show restraint . 
incidentally , `` reasonable '' home plate umpire would 
resistant seek appeal first base umpire , gant 
request . 
home plate umpire appeal first , first base 
umpire could wring strike , gant would 
upset . 
call ball , catcher request 
appeal , likely home plate umpire would ask help . 
finally , entire game pretty much mockery so-called 
effort `` speed game . '' 
game play quickly , 
2 hour stuff happen ninth , delay 
entire game result action umpire 
deion clean garbage field .
