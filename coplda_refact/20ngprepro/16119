`` white house e-mail address '' really work yet ? 
someone 
post address compuserve month ago , apparently 
white house really set hundred thousand ? 
message day account want people use 
yet . 
mci address something people white house 
actually read , another craig shergold story ? 
know -- 
ask . 
unless people white house print distribute mail 
every day , may better luck printing letter paper , 
flat white stuff desk 
white house . 
imagine write local representative 
senator would hurt either . 
heck , write al gore 
?
