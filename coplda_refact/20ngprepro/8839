try build circuit detect presence video v. 
blank screen monitor r , g , b output graphic 
card . 
able detect presence single pixel 
65 mhz , would mean detect 15 n pulse . 
also 
able tell difference blank screen 300 mv 
dim screen say , around 310 mv . 
oh yes , also need 
cheap . 
first circuit dismal failure . 
use 3 ; 
+ input go one gun , - input 
go reference create voltage divider potentiometer . 
first problem way slow . 
. 

need get several pixel row would fire 
, could whole screen full text , 
circuit would detect . 
second problem noise reference 
smallest difference blank screen dim screen . 

fact difference completely black completely white 
650 mv . 
wonder go amplify 
video signal make work . 
faster , expensive , require 
split supplies . 
would need replace .49 quad 
three 1.89 , create whole new power supply 
circuit . 
point , think need sort transistor 
circuit . 
transistor fast cheap trick ... 
unfortunately , way league come design 
transistor circuit , appeal net help . 

idea , tip , circuit , pointer , reference , etc. would greatly 
appreciate . 
oh yes , sample output thing every second , 
need fast response time , however , find 
way take advantage fact . 
thanks lot help anybody might able give . 
course , 
undying gratitude .
