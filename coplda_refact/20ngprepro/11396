relativist would like answer question , way 
phrase question make unanswerable . 
concept `` right '' 
`` wrong '' `` '' `` '' belong 
domain epistemological rather moral question . 
make 
sense ask moral position right wrong , although 
legitimate ask good better another position . 
let illustrate point look psychological derivative 
epistemology ethic : perception motivation , respectively . 
one certainly ask percept `` right '' correct , true , 
veridical `` wrong '' incorrect , false , illusory . 
make little 
sense ask motive true false . 
hand , 
strange ask whether percept morally good evil , one 
certainly ask question motive . 
therefore , suggest answer - c simply consider : 
assume judge correctness moral judgment . 
problem d double-barrelled : agree 
first part `` rightness '' moral position 
meaningless question , reason state . 

irrelevant alleged implication implication 
one feel peace better war . 
certainly make 
value judgment bad , better , best without assert `` correctness '' 
position . 
sorry lengthy dismissal - d . 
short e answer 
two individual grotesquely disagree moral issue , 
neither right correct wrong incorrect . 
simply hold 
different moral value feeling .
