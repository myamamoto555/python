rough sketch system work . 
reference station 
exactly know position compute error 
incoming gp signal . 
error due several factor 
include atmospheric distortion , sa selective availability time 
dither , etc. . 
reference unit contain complex computational 
equipment `` back '' error position since know 
already . 
transmit correction 
broadcast available number relatively local 
receiver . 
receiver nearby < 300km use 
satellite reference unit , error 
similar reference unit receiver unit . 
thus , 
receiver unit may apply correction calculate reference 
unit . 
us coast guard currently far know install series 
coastline transmitter differential gp . 
station 
use exist radio tower . 
believe frequency approximately 
305 khz . 
many private corporation offer dgp signal 
different frequency . 
example , pinpoint 310 offer 
correction signal receiver unit use fm broadcast system 
station across us . 
correction code usually transmit use 104 format . 
advertise accuracy espouse 1 5 meter error .
