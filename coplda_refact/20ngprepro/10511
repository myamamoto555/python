justification ? 
, mathew propose public defense mechanism , treat 
electronic device impropriety wearer . 
say 
next step beyond propose permanent bugging potential 
criminal . 
may , surface , sound like bad thing , 
define potential criminal ? 
government day decide 
member opposition party make potential criminal 
openly defy government become lethal practice , 
conducive free society . 
mathew say implant electronic surveillance device upon people 
impropriety upon person , regardless type crime 
chance recidivism . 
basically see criminal justice 
system punishment offender possibly , therefore , 
future offender . 
mathew see , probably , means 
rehabilitation offender . 
cynical , okay ?
