resin t40 carbon fiber reinforcement compressive 
strength 280,000 psus . 
density 0.058 , 
therefore theoretical height constant section column 
support 4.8 million inch , 400,000 ft , 
75 statute mile . 
, real structure horizontal brace either truss 
type , guy wire , use crush strength . 
let assume operate 40 % theoretical 
strength . 
give work height 30 mile constant 
section column . 
constant section column limit high 
build something allow taper cross section 
go . 
example , let say 280,000 pound 
load support top tower simplicity 
calculation . 
require 2.5 square inch column cross 
sectional area support weight . 
mile structure 
payload weigh 9,200 lb , 1 mile 
payload , total load lb , 3.3 % increase . 
next mile structure must 3.3 % thicker cross section 
support top mile tower plus payload . 
mile 
structure must increase area ratio way 
bottom . 
see theoretical 
limit area , although practical limit base 
much composite afford $ , 
much load need support ground need 
foundation bedrock support . 
let arbitrarily choose $ 1 billion limit 
cost . 
afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb composite , 
assume finish structure cost $ . 
$ figure 
material cost . 
mass 
ratio . 
3.3 % mass ratio per mile , tower 
height become 111 mile . 
clearly significant 
atmosphere . 
rocket launch top tower still 
provide orbital velocity , atmospheric drag 
almost eliminate . 
component 
rocket thrust vertical direction counter gravity , 
contribute horizontal orbital velocity . 
thus 
represent waste thrust . 
together drag , rocket start 
ground 15 % velocity penalty contend . 
analysis simplify , consider wind 
load . 
require structural support first 
15 mile height . 
, air pressure drop low 
enough value big factor .
