many atheist , lack belief god secondary 
epistemological consideration : accept reliable way 
know ? 
known valid logical argument existence 
god , empirical evidence exist . 

philosopher theologian agree idea god one 
must accept faith . 
faith belief without sound logical 
basis empirical evidence . 
reliable way know ? 
probably nothing else people would accept absence 
possibility proof . 
even agree take someone els 
word `` faith '' , mean find person 
reliable past , judge likely reliable source . 
find faith less reliable logic empirical evidence 
everywhere else , assume provide reliable knowledge 
god ? 
difference atheist theist fundamentally 
one whether faith hold reliable way know , 
rather , agnostic poster would , whether one faith 
god god . 
theist believe faith acceptable 
basis belief god , even reject faith reliable 
time , example work scientist . 
atheist 
believe logic empirical evidence lead reliable 
knowledge . 
agnosticism seem less defensible position 
theism atheism , unless one sceptic regard 
knowledge . 
without evidence , believe god rather

would also like point atheist 
require absolute knowledge lack god . 
believe 
thing absolute knowledge . 
atheism best 
simplest theory fit lack fact hold 
contrary evidence find .
