would method vulnerable `` birthday '' attack ? 
currently cracker need find _ _ 1 key produce 
give ciphertext . 
try 2 ^ 63 key average . 
propose method cracker need _ pair _ key half . 
store 2 ^ 32 guess one half , likely find 
pair 2 ^ 32 guess . 
assume 
, key guess . 

modification s-box salt bit make ? 
1 probably one key ; think 1 chance 128 
two key anyone verify ? 
, 
help cracker much .
