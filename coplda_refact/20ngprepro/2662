actually , jon , quite true . 
christian people cause 
`` objective morality '' look `` relative . '' 
, 
point original question thread , i.e. toss 
christianity obviously inconsistent 
principle ? 
bear , attempt explain 
apparent inconsistency least one christian 's viewpoint : 
god exist creator mankind bible claim , 
pretty well-defined concept make people tick 
physically , emotionally , etc. . 
god `` objective '' morality . 
say , trouble understand good 
detrimental creature create . 
galatians 2:10 -- mankind workmanship , create 
christ jesus good work morality , god prepare 
beforehand well-defined design , might walk . 
however , contrary many people assume include 
bible , god 's morality completely codify list 
rule regulation . 
extent , every activity 
person 's life create new situation morality must 
apply . 
never could enough volume codify god 's 
`` objective '' morality . 
throughout history , mankind try reduce morality list 
rule objectivity , please . 
old testament , 
principle specific rule . 
time jesus , 
principle obscure emphasis man place rule . 
volume additional rule make try codify 
application principle . 
mankind comfortable 
`` subjectivity '' principle . 
reference see matthew 5 jesus explain difference 
law principle law . 
example , 
verse 21-22 : `` hear ancient tell , 
` shall commit murder ' ... ` whoever commit murder shall 
liable court . ' 
say everyone 
angry brother shall liable court ... '' 
`` objective morality '' god get blur inept 
interpretation . 
christian make biggest error 
allow one person group people decide exactly 
god intend . 
christian would stay commit 
seek god 's instead try prove already 
figure , might better job allow find god 's 
`` objective morality '' . 
jesus say 
fundamental question , `` objective 
morality . ''
