agree formal training essential safe ride , 
disagree strongly original point . 
point formal training 
must prepare rider road . 
preparedness opinion 
know much possible . 
, exclude aspect ride bike 
course wrong . 
countersteering particular . 
countersteering something must train . 
common reaction among 
new biker bicycle rider emergency situation , steer 
motorcycle like bicycle . 
know make motorcycle go 
direction opposite intend . 
needless say , dangerous . 
specific example : rider left turn . 
rider think 
close right shoulder road , try steer 
motorcycle leave pull left handle push right 
handle . 
motorcycle straighten go road . 
worse scenario : rider , turn . 
middle turn 
rider see truck come towards . 
panicking rider try 
steer motorcycle away truck crash right . 
main function ride course teach avoid emergency 
situation , one . 
thus , knowledge training 
countersteering must ride course .
