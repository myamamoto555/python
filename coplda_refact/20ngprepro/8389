well , yes . 
particularly want discussion spark 
lengthy debate , think worth point `` popular 
usage '' always sufficient excuse . 
case , example , think appropriate parallel may find 
pronunciation proper name : people commonly misspell 
mispronounce name , would feel compel change ? 
probably 
. 
true x. `` x window system '' , `` x '' , `` x11 '' , related 
monicker proper name sense product name 
proper name . 
fact , trademark name . 
fact 
many people get wrong largely beside point . 
trade publication promulgate thing like `` x window '' 
`` '' nonsensical variant one often see , 
consider fact publication supposedly write 
journalist . 
would trust fact journalist could 
bother get name source right ? 
would trust 
product review someone get name product wrong ? 
popular usage may , one hold people 
claim journalist higher standard correctness .
