20 ? 
well , something write time ago response 
similar question . 
hope help : 
begin repeat previous post 
scripture mention agree seem 
problem , eternal marriage marriage general . 
luke 's version jesus say child world 
marry give marriage attain 
kingdom heaven . 
almost sound like marriage disqualify 
one salvation . 
matthew mark omit statement . 

think account clear might . 
let 's 
look incident see come reasonable 
idea mean . 
scripture involve mat -30 , 
mark 12:18 -25 , luke -36 . 
happen sadducees , believe 
resurrection , think could trap jesus . 
make reference 
`` '' marriage require brother man die 
without child take widow wife raise child . 
child would consider child deceased , 
though woman 's first husband father . 
seem 
obvious woman still consider way 
wife first husband . 
however , sadducees concoct 
scene 6 brother deceased turn fail 
father child widow . 
seem imply 
marriage equal first ask , `` whose wife shall 
resurrection ? '' 
point seem obvious 
anybody 's wife , first husband . 
, 
bear child would credit regardless 
brother biological father . 
possible jesus 
refer say , `` ye err , know 
scripture power god . '' 
mat , compare mark 12:24 , 
phrase luke 's account . 
anyway , sadducees ask , `` whose wife 
resurrection , see 7 ? '' 
jesus answer , 
`` resurrection neither marry give 
marriage ... '' mat 22:30 `` rise dead neither 
marry ... '' mark 12:25 `` account worthy obtain 
world neither marry ... '' luke 20:35 3 account go 
say , `` angel heaven '' equivalent . 
find 
last helpful since bible define angel 
give idea life like . 
minister claim 
sexless , different human etc. find 
biblical support . 
think jesus say clearest matthew 's 
mark 's account marriage perform 
resurrection . 
go along belief person 
marry must earth . 
however , 
believe marriage perform authority god 
binding eternity . 
fact , first marriage appear 
perform god death enter world 
garden eden . 
therefore god join together , let 
man put asunder . 
mat jesus also tell peter 
apostle whatsoever bind earth bind 
heaven mat 16:19 , 18:18 . 
believe also refer 
marriage perform proper authority .
