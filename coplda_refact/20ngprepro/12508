mention study couple time : ingestion yogurt 
contain lactobacillus acidophilus prophylaxis 
vaginitis , annals internal medicine , 116 5 -7 . 

problem study use yogurt rather 
capsule lactobacillus even though positive result ? 
study crossover trial daily ingestion 8 ounce 
yogurt . 
marked decrease infection woman 
ingest yogurt . 
problem study include small 
number 33 patient enrol many protocol violation 
21 patient analyze . 
still , difference rate infection 
two group large study remain fairly 
believable .
