disarm . 
hezbollah remain independent militia . 
hezbollah

sheikh , wife , young son .

lebanon stop assassinate people shell village would 
make lebanese mad . 
furthermore , hezbollah 
subsequently disarm , would possible .

syria israel border , presence syrian troops 
lebanon mean sharp decrease attack israeli territory
