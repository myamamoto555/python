number factor important , three 
biggest air velocity , air momentum shock wave . 
velocity stack use year use inside 
stock airbox number bike . 
tune engine rpm , 
stack greatly increase speed , thus momentum air 
rush . 
air momentum critical get good air intake : momentum 
air stack outside combustion chamber force way inside 
long piston begin compressive . 
shock wave use induce air intake prevent fresh air 
escape port . 
shock wave product expansion 
chamber means present ` wall ' opening closing 
air motion . 
beyond lose mystery 
design shock wave .
