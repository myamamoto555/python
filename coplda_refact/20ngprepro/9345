need advice someone ride pillion 750 ninja . 
first time take anyone extended ride 
read : farther around block . 
'll ride twisty , 
fairly bumpy road mines . 
hamilton loop sf bay . 
would say bad idea - start something 
much mellower neither one get head . 
particular road require full concentration - sort 
thing want take passenger first time . 
decide like ride together , want 
something longer challenging , go hard core road 
like . 
hamilton . 
case , moral responsibility make sure 
proper gear fit - especially go sport 
ride .
