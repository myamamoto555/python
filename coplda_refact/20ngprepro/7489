may wrong , loaded tarus beat saturn sl2 . 
agree sl2 would come close price 
lower-end ford taurus . 
taurus , hand , would still 
substantially expensive even glitzy sl2 . 
fully load 
sl2 would run somewhere around $ 17,000 , fully load taurus lx would 
somewhere around $ 22,000 - $ 23,000 range . 
base taurus gl believe might 
start around $ 15,000 . 
course taurus sho push $ 30,000 
really try , totally different car mainstream 
taurus sedan . 
statement entirely faulty , little 
inaccurate .

netter .

impreza wagon , probably get good deal one last one .
