. 
implement blinking text cursor reason people mention . 
even configure actual size text cursor horizontal ver - 
tical line cursor , smaller block cursor , turn blinking , 
set blink rate . 
even get blinking text - ok , enough 
advertising . 
look code respect , memory 
decide whether start make 
want mostly blinking text , would say easy , since 
hairy mess understandable follow root back 
x10 . 
actual task get cursor blink difficult 
provide right hook . 
antonio mention , 'll show 
cursor directly move , people become confused . 
since good idea take cursor screen 
anything screen anyway , complicate . 
'll 
start blink process cursor show directly 
map . 
portability emu newest version . 
one export 
still r5 tape . 
want get new 
release six month , unfortunately drown work . 
since change emu 's behavior much , would say 
whoever want try emu wait new version . 
, emu work bsd derive system e.g. suns anything else 
csh . 
fix , short remove one line 
code . 
'll put export today .
