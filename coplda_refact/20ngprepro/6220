original question : many time 
begin x user heck , experience x user ! 
write small test 
program . 
many time forget draw response expose 
event , thus see result whereby sometimes application 's 
graphic show , sometimes . 
try 
eliminate `` easy '' explanation see 
graphic . 
say , try copy different plane 
window 16 1 4 . 
try 1 , 1 1 , 1 2 , ... , 1 7 
see get output . 
since single 
plane datum , possible pixel value 
value color plane .
