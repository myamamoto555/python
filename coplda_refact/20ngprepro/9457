gamma ray bursts grb see come equally direction . 
however , give number bright one , faint 
one consistent equally dense far 
see -- contain within 
finite sphere sphere fuzzy edge 
center . 
measurement statistical , 
always hide sufficiently small number different 
type grb different origin datum . 
assume 
one population grb . 
datum indicate less 10 % radius center 
distribution . 
thing earth exact center 
solar system scale oort cloud comet 
way beyond pluto universe . 
cosmological theory , place 
grb throughout universe , require energy 
release timescale millisecond . 
oort cloud model 
tend silly , even standard astrophysics . 
grb galactic i.e. distribute milky way galaxy 
would expect either concentrate plane 
galaxy ` disk ' population , towards galactic center 
spherical ` halo ' population . 
see , 
galactic , must halo least 250,000 light year 
radius , would probably start see grb andromeda 
galaxy assume similar halo . 
comparison , 
earth 25,000 light-year center galaxy .

130 grb different model referee literature . 
right , theorist sort unofficial moratorium 
new model new observational evidence come .
