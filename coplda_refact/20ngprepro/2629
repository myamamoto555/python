wonder anyone shed light 
electronic odometer remember total elapsed mileage ? 
kind 
memory enough , non-volatile enough independent enough 
outside battery power last say , 10 year , life 
vehicle ? 
amaze anything like could expect work 
length time especially light gizmo work 
good work 2 month without break somehow . 
side question : legal ramification sell use car 
replace odometer start 0 mile , say 
actual mile . 
look like fraud would fairly easy - price 
new odometer , say however many mile want tell 
buyer . 
thanks insight .
