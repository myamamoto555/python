double standard human behavior regard jews must 
. 
perfect example outcry temporary removal 
400 man advocate murder jews destroy state 
israel , compare deafening silence abusive 
treatment jews arab country past 50 year . 
compare tacit world give muslims 
randomly murder jewish civilian righteous indignation 
express people occupied territory keep 
work israel effort reduce random murder 
occur , everyone know country 
require accept foreign worker , except israel , course . 
jewish blood always cheap . 
non-jewish world ha 
never regard form jewish suffering important , except 
jews model powerless victim holding 
high moral ground , world war 2 . 
however , soon jewish people start take care 
, ancient hatred jews unleash . 
doubt non-jewish world even capable 
compassion towards jews anti-semitism ancient 
basic christianity islam . 
golda meir say would peace arabs love 
child hate jews . 

know arab parent love child 
would send child street 
throw rock man train defend gun , 
world obsess hatred jews try defend 
yet even question action 
parent simply allow child , 
encourage throw harm 's way . 
even 
arab child expendable , tragic death use 
neverending propoganda battle blame israel , 
jews , misfortune befalling arabs middle east . 

jew ? 
person whose integrity decay unmoved 
knowledge wrong people .
