suggestion ? 
even better strategy leave less buffer 
car front , enough around . 
keep bike 
1st gear clutch handle squeeze 's 
? 
, two car stop behind . 
next bdi cager come , simply ride along side 
car front . 
need panic , 
pop clutch stall engine . 
smoothly , 
rapidly . 
cage front provide much better protection 
anything else particularly empty road .
