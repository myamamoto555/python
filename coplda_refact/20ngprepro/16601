koresh go rampage ? 
see unnecessary , unprovoked massive attack feb. 28th . 
probably even illegal action atf , certainly way proportion 
anything reasonable . 
yet , accord pole take yesterday , 95 % people pole 
believe government force act appropriately . 
` believe 
reno president guilt attack . 
suppose also believe thing like : 
`` would present 5-year plan balance budget . '' 
`` ` need lead tax increase ... '' 
`` start middle-class tax cut ... '' 
`` ` ll bill ready day inaugurate ` ll 
100 day period ... productive modern history . '' 
`` ask congress line item veto . 
. '' 
`` lift social security earnings test . 
. '' 
personally prefer disbelieve government prove 
right , rather way around . 
way better 
50 % chance right first guess ! 
read constitution sometime , suppose protect citizen 
rights . 
sick abuse government power . 
tom jefferson say : 
`` government , ... , shall draw washington center 
power , render powerless check provide one government 
another become venal oppressive government 
separate . ''
