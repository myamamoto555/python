understand experience look word , 
discuss individual , meaning 
word rather clear . 
basically literally mean `` bed man '' 
`` sex man . '' 
burden proof 
side argument show word 
idiomatic meaning evident literal meaning . 
one speculate 
day long might mean something else , need evidence 
create new doctrine , get rid historical understanding 
meaning word . 
link hudson . 
read enough discussion passage , liberal 
conservative source , sure meaning -- even literal 
meaning -- certain . 
mean one come 
conclusion , mean think doubt 
paul think homosexuality . 
plausible argument 
couple different meaning .
