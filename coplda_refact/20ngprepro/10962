way -- get ta walter johnson . 
washington . 
carlton spend long st. louis collect less 700 .

would also guess hough due length tenure though suspect 
bobby witt far behind . 
maybe even jenkins snuck close ...

nyy sd , fingers mil , oak 
fingers achieve 100 either mil sd , yes , 
would go guess . 
otherwise think reardon better 
chance 100 min along would think easily reach 100 
mon. . 
> know dept. . 
got ta willie mays ... fairly sure 300 steal 
career .

hmmm ... leary really good point . 
would forget . 
well , 
nothing else , plenty pitcher category 
`` could lose team '' -- koosman , leary , torrez , ryan , seaver ... 
guess best three guess would leary , ryan , either seaver 
koosman .
