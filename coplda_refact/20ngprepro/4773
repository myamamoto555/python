sorry miss raymond , dahlgren last month ... 
virtual reality market manager silicon graphics , perhaps 
help little . 
article < > , 
raymond chui write :

agency start express interest

far , know much vr .

also know something vr abc news magazine

unfortunately , sgi system use create special effect 
terminator 2 lawnmower man , computer 
graphic , render software write film frame time . 

frame computer animation film take hour render 
high-end parallel processing computer system . 
thus , level graphic 
would difficult , impossible , acheive real time 30 frame 
per second .

depend upon serious advanced application . 
true immersive visualization vr , require rendering complex visual 
database anywhere 20 60 newly render frame per second . 

similar requirement traditional flight simulator pilot 
training . 
frame rate low , user notice step 
frame move head rapidly around scene , motion 
graphic smooth contiguous . 
thus graphic system 
must powerful enough sustain high frame rate render complex 
datum representation . 
additionally , frame rate must constant . 
system render 15 
frame per second one point , 60 frame per second next perhaps 
due scene new view direction simpler 
visible , user get heavily distract medium 
graphic computer rather focus datum . 
maintain constant 
frame rate , system must able run real-time . 
unix general 
support real-time operation , silicon graphics modify 
unix kernel multi-processor system able support real-time 
operation , bypass usual unix process scheme . 
uniprocessor system run unix fundamentally support real-time 
operation sun , hp 700 series system , ibm , 
even sgi 's uniprocessor system like indigo crimson . 

multiprocessor onyx challenge system support real-time operation due 
symmetric smp architecture . 
graphic perspective , render complex virtual environment 
require advanced render technique like texture mapping real-time 
anti-aliasing . 
general purpose graphic system 
market today , crimson onyx 
system fully support capability . 
anti-aliasing particularly 
important , crawl jagged edge aliased polygon 
unfortunate distraction immerse virtual environment . 
| > kind graphic language use vr 
| > gl , opengl , , pex , gks , etc. ? 
use general purpose graphic library list develop 
vr application , start pretty low level . 

- shelf software package available get go much faster , 
target directly vr application developer .
