buy ! 
thing mention give headache 
later . 
also sound like car need lot work probably 
know bmw 's cheap fix either . 
owner sound like shady 
character try take advantage someone . 
sure $ 3000 sound good 
calculate much repair . 
sound like 
would sink least $ 1000 get everything fix . 
also never trust anyone far mileage concern . 
know many 
mile drive . 
sure people tell bmw 's hold 
consider car subject wear tear . 
know 
could 200,000 mile . 
thing remember 
last around either . 
wait keep shopping . 
around $ 
probably find one better , need less repair , 
legitimate mileage unlike one consider . 
take guy 
take couple time . 
good luck .
