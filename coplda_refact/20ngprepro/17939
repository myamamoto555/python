please tell ! 
use join command many year , mostly good 
success duplicate file mount . 
hear lot 
people cursing join confuse append command 
truely gnarly hack , believe . 
also hear 
people say microsoft recommend use join . 
, 
microsoft 's windows 4 workgroups resource toolkit , follow appear : 
`` join , utility , work fine windows workgroups 3.1 
change state join drive windows 
workgroups 3.1 session . 
include add remove join drive 
within windows workgroups . 
recommend use 
join run windows setup windows workgroups 3.1 . '' 
within caveat , join appear valid window . 
however , 
find couple application deal well filesystem 
`` mount '' use join . 
particular , worst offender word windows 2.0 x. get 
confuse edit try save file join drive . 

want create save file ~ current dir , 
delete old file rename ~ file . 
doc file . 
unfortunately , usually write ~ file idiotic 
place current directory often root dir 
join filesystem , always . 
, delete original 
. 
doc file , find ~ file rename . 
unless 
search disk system , document go . 
also find subtle problem use mks toolkit box 
join filesystem present . 
use join c : \ temp 
, mks sometimes get confuse `` l '' c : \ temp 
dir , miss file temp dir . 
difficult 
reproduce , go away totally join use . 
think 
windows problem , rather mks 's , since work ok raw 
dos . 
, would suggest use join , aware may 
robust would like . 
would real great `` mount '' network drive i.e. z main 
file tree , rather darned drive letter ? 
unfortunately , 
join let . 
talk net simple patch 
let join work network drive , remember source . 
bad join command better implement , since would 
avoid use stupid drive letter . 
realize 
mean casual , even ignorant user , `` mount '' drive 
one file tree might confusing . 
, look like m go carry 
window nt another os mean casual , even 
user -- ! 
. 
old family system baggage , maybe m need 
recovery group get life .
