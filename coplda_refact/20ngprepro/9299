friend really find registered dietician rd . 

work hospital clinic , many major city rd 's 
`` private practice '' speak . 
many physican refer 
patient crohn 's disease rd 's dietary help . 
get 
friend 's physician make referral , medical insurance pay 
rd 's service like service physical therapist . 

better medical insurance plan cover even friend 's 
plan , would well worth cost get good diet 
control intestinal discomfort help intestinal lining heal . 
crohn 's disease inflammatory disease intestinal lining 
inhibitor may help decrease leukotriene formation 
aware tea turmeric contain inhibitor . 

bad inflammation , steroid use mild case , side effect 
worth small benefit gain steroid use . 
upjohn develop 
new inhibitor greatly help deal 
inflammatory disease available yet .
