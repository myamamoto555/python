mr. stowell seem jump rather strangely truth absolute . 
see necessarily follow . 
truth also absolute ? 
scripture truth therefore absolute ? 
answer either question , perhaps 
explain determine part scripture truth , 
truth absolute . 
, qualify make 
determination ? 
hardly consensus , even evangelical 
christianity mention rest christianity regard 
biblical interpretation . 
find mr. stowell 's statement terribly simple-minded .
