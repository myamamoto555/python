first , original poster misquote . 
reference 2 tim 3:16 . 
author paul , revelation anything '' best 
second-hand '' . 
`` come saul journey , approach 
damascus , suddenly light heaven flash around ; 
fall ground , hear voice say , `` saul , saul , 
persecute ? '' 
say , `` art thou , lord ? '' 

say , `` jesus persecute , ... '' 
act -5 , nas 
paul receive revelation directly rise jesus ! 
pretty cool , eh ? 

become closely involve early church , leader 
follower jesus throughout ministry earth .

agree . 
believe anyone spirit would able convince 
spirit exist . 
please complain circular . 
know 
, really , anything natural world explain supernatural ? 
revelation necessary author bible .

spirit part god . 
much closer source get ? 
greek 2 timothy sometimes translate `` inspire god '' , 
literally mean `` '' . 
word , god speak actual word 
scripture . 
many theologian bible scholar dr. james boice 
one remember off-hand get quite annoy dryness 
incompleteness `` inspire god '' .

verse take 2 timothy . 
continuity 
book write span 1500 year 40 author walk 
life testimony single authorship god . 
reason , read say 1 corinthians 1:18 -31 
human wisdom . 
basically say human wisdom useless 
compare god write learning .

> realize reason law prophet 
> common man . 
source claim discover information superior 
historicity bible ? 
certainly josephus ' writings , writings 
gnostic third century , earliest . 
> though claim jesus 
> human , human wisdom 
> apostle paul set criticize . 
yet , would

jesus fully god well . 
would assert wise . 
realize may accept authority bible . 

unfortunate say least , way learn 
god christ god 's purpose earth read 
bible search truth .

please rethink last paragraph . 
god , seem 
current belief , jesus either liar complete nut 
assert god exist , claim god ! 
regard 
c.s. lewis could least bit respect jesus ? 
conclusion , careful logically unfounded hypothesis base 
gut feeling text scholar ' unsubstantiated claim . 
bible plead take entirety throw whole book . 
reading bible , spirit inspire 
writer , guide reader well . 
understand 
least without spirit 's guidance : 
`` god reveal spirit ; spirit 
search thing , even depths god . '' 
1 cor 2:10 , nas 
peace may god guide wisdom .

theologian get quite annoyed 
`` . '' 
true greek word root `` god '' 
`` breath '' . 
however etymology necessarily tell 
word mean . 
otherwise , `` goodbye '' would religious expression 
since come `` god ye '' . 
look 
word actually use . 
case word use wisdom 
dream come god . 
`` '' .
