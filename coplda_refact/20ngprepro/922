keyword : spline rasterization 
lines : 38 
year ago start work problem appear 
simple turn quite difficult . 
wonder 
anyone net see problem hopefully publish 
solution . 
problem draw outline surface define two 
roughly parallel cubic spline . 
input problem essentially 
start two set point set point 
edge object treat two dimensional , i.e. extant 
edge , exist three dimensional space . 
draw 
object 
1 fit cubic spline point . 
spline effectively 
compute sequence line segment approximate 
curve . 
spline equal number segment . 
assume 
nth segment along spline roughly , 
exactly , distance along spline reasonable 
measure . 
2 take segment n along spline match nth segment 
oppose spline . 
use pair segment form two 
triangle fill color surface . 
3 depth sort triangle 
4 take triangle sort order , project onto 2d , draw 
color triangle . 
take edge triangle 
along edge surface draw line along edge 
color special `` edge color '' 
edge color step 4 heart 
problem . 
idea effectively outline edge surface . 
net result however generally lot break gap 
edge surface . 
reason fairly complicate . 
involve rasterization problem problem result 
project spline . 
anything problem 
sound familiar would appreciate know work 
area . 
- thanks
