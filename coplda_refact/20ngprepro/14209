`` quick 
look '' justice depth book jeremiah . 

study period solidly year one 
stage life , say great deal underlie 
theological meaning judgement prophesy . 
let make one point . 
clash jeremiah `` false prophet '' primarily 
theological realm . 
`` false prophet '' understand 
god base covenant lord make david . 

possible trace within page old testament covenant , 
initially conditional continue obedience david 's 
descendant , come view unconditional promise part 
lord keep descendant david 's upon throne never 
allow jerusalem foreign power . 
jeremiah 
prophet . 
, across border formerly 
israelite territory . 
come prophesy , come 
theological background covenant lord make israel 
moses . 
northern kingdom reject davidic covenant 
death solomon . 
theology clash theology 
local prophet . 
deep understanding mosaic 
covenant awareness international event jeremiah 
speak prophesy . 
`` judgement prophesy '' deeply load 
theological meaning . 
opinion , portland earthquake prophesy david wilkerson 
`` new york burn '' prophesy froth bubble compare majestic 
theological depths jeremiah prophesy .
