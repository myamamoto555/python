useful ? 
find estimate annual value law enforcement 
$ 5 million quite useful , rough e.g. wiretap may 
preferentially use criminal , result 
underestimate . 
come twenty cent head 
u.s. population . 
would find rigorous number quite 
useful -- would make nice slogan : `` privacy worth 
$ 0.37 '' , whatever turn .
