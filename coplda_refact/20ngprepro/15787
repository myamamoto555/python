earlier discussion thread may 
give impression even though child 
require baptism would hurt . 
contrary , baptize child 
capable comprehend deny 
opportunity demonstrate desire 
serve god . 
consider child 
accountable sin capable 
repentance ? 
peter say group `` man brethren , '' `` repent 
baptize every one '' act 2:38 . 
notice specify repent 
may baptize . 
follow peter 's instruction people must first 
demonstrate repentance forsaking sin 
desire obey god 's command 
eligible baptize . 
since young child capable repent , 
eligible baptism . 
since god merciful `` sin 
imputed law '' romans 5:13 , young 
child accountable 
comprehend .
