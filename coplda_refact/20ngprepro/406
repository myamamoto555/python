shoot , ya never know : 
buy real cheap equalizer power amp car tape player 
one truckload sale , sound great . 

, . 
one channel quit entirely . 
open , 
amplifier chip bad channel simply melt solder 
joint attach pcb . 
solder back work fine . 
keep volume bit lower . 
probably 
lousy heat sinking . 
say `` nice alpine '' sure order mag higher 
quality . 
point - look inside 
scrap , since occasionally find something repair . 
maybe even thing find . 
good luck !
