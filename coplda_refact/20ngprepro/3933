hus everyone , 
think people may interested vr 
software group : 
announce release 
multiverse multi-user , , base virtual reality 
system , primarily focus . 
feature : 
client-server base model , use berkeley sockets . 
limit number user apart performance . 
generic client . 
customizable server . 
object allow attachment camera light source . 
multiple light source ambient , point spot . 
object extension code , handle unique functionality , easily 
attach . 
functionality : 
client : 
client build around ` fast ' render loop . 
basically change thing 
tell server render image user 's 
viewpoint . 
also provide server information user 's 
action - communicate client therefore 
user . 
client design generic - word need 
develop new client want enter new world . 
mean 
resource spend enhance client software rather adapt 
. 
adaptation , explain moment , occur server . 
release client software support follow functionality : 
o hierarchical object associate address 
o multiple light source type ambient , point spot 
o user interface panels 
o colour polygonal render phong shading optional wireframe 
faster frame rate 
o mouse keyboard input 
people may disappoint software support 
input device - , 
one ! 
, however , one first enhancement ! 
server : 
customization take place . 
follow basic support 
provide release potential world server developer : 
o transparent client management 
o client message handling 
may sound like much , take away headache 
accept 
terminate client receive message - 
application writer 
work assumption thing happen locally . 
thing get interesting object extension functionality . 

provide allow animate object : 
o server selectable extension installation : 
mean decide object extend 
functionality world . 
basically call extension 
want . 
o event handler registration : 
develop extension object basically write callback 
function event want object respond . 
current event support : init , move , change , collide & terminate 
o collision detection registration : 
want object respond collision event provide 
basic information collision detection management software . 
callback activate collision occur . 
software keep separate application 
application developer want build library extended object 
choose . 
following need make world server application : 
o provide function : 
choose object extension support , plus 
initialization want . 
o provide function : 
determine place new client . 
o provide function : 
load world . 
file new client . 
o provide function : 
tell new client persona . 
o provide function : 
go wild ! 
minimum let object 
move call move function let server sleep bit 
avoid outrun client . 
! 
prove line count 
three world server provide : 
generic - 81 line 
dactyl - 270 line complicated collision detection due 
stair ! 
probably improve future 
version 
dogfight - 72 line 
location : 
software located follow site : 

directory : 

file : 
. 

future : 
client : 
o texture mapping . 
o realistic render : i.e. similar , gouraud shade 
o hmd support . 
o etc , etc. ... 
server : 
o physical modelling gravity , friction etc . 
o enhance object 
o etc , etc. ... 
: 
o improved comms !!! 
hope provide people good understanding multiverse 
software , 
unfortunately come practically zero documentation , sure 
whether ever able rectify ! 
: - 
hope people enjoy software useful exploration 
virtual universe - certainly find fascinating develop , 
would love add support ... hmd !! 
finally one major disclaimer : 
totally amateur code . 
mean support code 
, kindness heart , , pure 
desperation , provide . 
hold responsible anything good bad 
may happen use code - use risk ! 
disclaimer ! 
course love , would like . 
anyone 
positive also encourage contact . 
anyone 
hate : > ! 


anyone want let living : know 
write ! 


thanks ,
