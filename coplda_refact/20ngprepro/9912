try think respond without involve personal feeling 
perception without stats back point . 
however , think approach wrong way . 
believe 
people mention deserve hall fame dave kingman . 

feel much better player . 
say fall deserve 
go would deserve . 

dave kingman - definately . 
guy couple year 
could hit atleast respectable . 
rest career 
think fear pitcher . 
also think lot 
game . 
mean really met fan - met part career 
still would back hall fame . 
dave winfield - think . 
fear pitcher , several 
season hit respectable average production number 
opinion - without stats better kingman 's probably quite 
bit . 
also perceive leader , maybe much 
people none less leader . 
think make substantial 
contribution game baseball society . 
example 
charitable thing know 
yankees . 
think type player kid look 
definately criterion hall fame 
think deserve consideration . 
lee smith - maybe , would see stats definately would 
deserve go likes kingman . 
darrell evans - . 
eddie murray - maybe , good career , leader although 
silent one , good role model . 
stats good enough ? 

sure - would believe much better kingman 's 
average well power number good winfield 's . 

think , eddie much publicity great year . 
jeff reardon - guess , kind depend number . 

top head would take lee smith first .

big deal .

well , strongly disagree . 
guy deserve sure . 

talk leadership , guy leader 
lead team post season . 
robin 
good offensive number average power ozzie okay number 
offensively . 
difference ozzie give home run 
every run save make incredible play shortstop - would 
shatter aaron 's home run mark . 
many great play save 
game ? 
many great play motivate team rally win 
game ? 
believe guy number , baseball 
number least win baseball number . 
guy prove star belong hall fame . 

george brett also belong class player .

steve garvey - sure , probably guess could see someone 
make case . 
jack morris - first choice see someone might 
bring name . 
kirby puckett - probably . 
reason say definately still 
time leave career . 
continue 
probably turn definately . 
nolan ryan - really doubt ? 
think hear something 
53 record maybe good - know 
hear number . 
number , 
contribution game community great role model . 
would 
say best pitcher ever pitch game probably even 
top 20 would first pitcher would put hall fame 
accomplishment no-hitter , strikeout , respectable number - 
even weaker team go . 
really hope get 
possible vote . 
sum 3 group , belong , probably 
sure lean towards say belong least 
without see stats possibly hear reason go . 
yes - winfield , yount , brett mail , o. smith , puckett ryan 
maybe - murray l. smith 
- reardon , garvey , morris , evans definately kingman 
say stats around number back 
- entirely opinion base perception .
