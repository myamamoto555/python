want slow lead flash rate , adjustable switch 
digitally controlled switch , suggest look 555 
oscillator chip . 
cost ~ $ 1 radio shack much cheaper 
quantity quality place , able find good info 
simple circuit 555 notebook think forest 
mims one radio shack . 
'll toy 
value use head little math 
get right frequency . 
engineer worth salt , make 
555 ... book , leave see hate 
ascii circuit graphic . 
555 accurately go hz 
500 khz think . 
tape recorder gizmo , could alter stereo tape deck 
use one channel data line flash led , one audio 
line voice music . 
would eliminate lot noise . 
datum line probably easily 
kind pll bandpass filter use op-amp . 
565 
chip good pll , hard work . 
however nothing 
pll work , suggest try . 
op-amp

, popular 741 op-amp snap work . 
set frequency bandpass filter value easy , 
would suggest 555 method ... idea 
go , really generalize ... 
manufacture technique , goof , 
suggest breadboard thing ... need solder . 
would 
next , permanent step . 
lastly , making . 
hope clear thing ... .
