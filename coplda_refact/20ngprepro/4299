local bus ide controller generic get 
: 985 . 
try swap local bus ide controller isa ide controller 
: transfer rate go 830 . 
spec drive show maximum platter controller 
: transfer rate 2.83 . 
dont know get . 
local bus interface 
: get little , certainly much hope . 
also look way 
deal ide transfer rate ? 
anybody get throughput 
anywhere close platter - > controller rate ? 
see anything 
even close limit ide interface . 
drive 1:1 
, ? 
rate get : 
1 sequential read c program use bio call read 
block sequentially outside first track inward 
bus bus 
-------- --------- 
maxtor : 
quantum : 
2 disk buffer read c program , re-read block repeatedly 
effect read ram buffer drive 
bus bus 
-------- --------- 
maxtor : 
quantum : 
3 v2 .7 transfer rate seem agree 2 
bus bus 
-------- --------- 
maxtor : 
quantum : 
manage get hold quantum product manual go 
detail describe bit get platter , 
controller , ide interface . 
nowhere see 
anything like `` bit whip platter high speed 
sit around buffer thaw send host '' 
even though swear happen ; - > . 
relevent 
quote manual : 
`` datum transfer disk read buffer rate 
3.75 maximum , 1.87 minimum . '' 
calculation show 
maximum minimum ... disk spin rpm 87 
sector per track outside 44 inside 
`` single burst error 24 bit within one sector correct 
` on-the-fly ' , real time occur , allow high degree 
datum integrity impact drive 's performance . '' 
take 
mean error correction bottleneck 
`` operation , rate buffer 
ram 10.0 . 
high transfer rate allow interface 
ic communicate bus rate 5.0 , 
dc simultaneously control transfer '' 
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
thing even cache send 
request sector 3 64kb read buffer , guess 
could call cache . 
sequential read outer track , get 
measly get around ??? 
hard-disk engineer know ? 
wondering disk slow ,
