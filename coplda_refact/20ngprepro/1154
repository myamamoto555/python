careful folk ... also consider + @ force ring 
tip phone 's suppose ring ! 
even simple zener 
lead setup , might end carbon real quick . 
whatever 
scheme use , make sure get least component 
frontend . 
also remember , mistaken , phone line 
equivalent circuit . 
current draw get 
drop across . 
fine roughly 
12v , ma bell consider off-hook . 
drop 
far probably big no-no . 
easiest implementation accomplish ??

suggestion ... go ahead blow hole , 
get idea . 
choose high-efficiency lead need much 
current get light . 
choose value component 
require .
