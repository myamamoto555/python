hmm ... ad combination crank

sure , already get right idea . 
ignore 50 ohm internal resistance generator second , 
run , say , voltage divider make 990 ohm series 10 
ohm . 
new circuit equivalent one put 
original voltage , output negligibly 
less 10 ohm . 
may want monkey value little 
depend whether care _ exact _ divide ratio 
availability part . 
sound ?

p.s. -- high voltage probe multimeter 
accurate still cheap . 
something like 100 meg series 
100k , load often high source much , well 
keep probably 10 meg impedance multimeter happy .
