wow ! 
get think ! 
interesting question recently 
move society classify previously `` socially unacceptable '' yet legal 
activity ok . 
past seem always two 
coexist method social control . 
first explicit legal control . 
set 
action define currently illegal specifically define set 
punishment . 
secondly somewhat hidden social control . 

action consider socially unacceptable cover 
legal control , controle social censure . 
ideally 
socialization work legal control hardly ever need 
since people control action due pressure 
social censure . 
control manifest day-to-day life `` guilt '' 
`` morality '' . 
hear say fully believe 
vast majority people police , legal control would 
absolutely impossible . 
lately last 50 , 100 year ? 
however move 
attempt individual societal control ie . 

illegal , pick . 
say wrong , merely 
byproduct society : 
1 high education level , 
2 high exposure alternative idea via popular media , 
3 high level institutionalized individual rights , 
4 `` '' orient culture . 
guess say appear state transition , 
western world still many idea \ 
allow people base entirely personal squeamishness , yet 
fully bent maximize individual freedom max long 
freedom impinge another 's . 
society try two mutually exclusive end . 

appreciate individual rights satisfy old 
territoriality dominance instinct , removal socialize , 
inherent fear base ignorance result 
continue destabilization society . 
get quick fix . 
idea get 
mess . 
know would never consent personal freedom 
order `` stabilize '' society . 
yet believe development society 
follow darwinian process select stability . 
find 
social model maximize . 
free . 
's yet stable ? 
perhaps 
possible live `` '' society ? 
anybody see way ? 
comment ? 
ps . 
therefore answer question # 3 : . 
want ?
