consecrate four bishop ensure future society . 
canon 
law provide situation , even one believe 
future society could guarantee without 
consecration , fact archbishop believe sincerely 
could mean , canon law state clearly , incur 
excommunication . 
furthermore , vatican allow prelate 
archbishop weakland undermine faith impunity 
expect catholics pay least attention sanction
