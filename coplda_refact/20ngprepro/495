occur algorithm secret . 

publish , one could build physically identical clone version 
chip would interoperate official clipper chip . 

cloner would provide key escrow house . 
. 
technical hack miss ? 
e.g. 
chip make unprogrammed serialize , ship 
two escrow house program half key , 
way require secret key know escrow house 
install well , without clone version would 
interoperate ? 
get awfully complicate , 
crypto .
