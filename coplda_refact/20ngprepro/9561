lawyer best understanding , congress 
rights enumerate constitution . 

prime reason national firearms act base collect revenue . 
since congress authority levy tax , nfa tax act 
registration requirement within assist tax collection . 
922 , order constitutional , must basis particular 
authority grant congress constitution . 
congress 
arbitrarily ban substance product . 
prohibition come 
effect , pass ammendment . 
say constitutionality 
law need clarify . 
believe unconstitutional law 
never constitutional . 
law determine supreme court , 
unconstitutional , law never really law . 
nature law 
unconstitutional invalidate law inception . 
please correct 
wrong , law deem unconstitutional , anyone 
convict break law absolved . 
believe 922 ever challenge court . 
nfa 
invalidate two federal district court case one may appellate 
level u.s. vs rock island armory u.s. vs dalton .
