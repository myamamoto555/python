make mistake : confuse drive

scsi : external device expansion interface common mac ibm . 
allow use device : hard drive , printer , scanner , nubus card 
expansion mac plus , monitor , cd-rom .

main problem : lot external device internal 
terminate cause problem two devise scsi port 
chain suppose terminate begining 
end . 
set cause problem either mac ibm . 
: 7 device per controller . 
8-bit asynchronous ~ 1.5 ave 
synchronous max transfer base . 
16-bit require 
chip provide fast wide 
16-bit interface see . 
: 10 device per controller mode .

ide : integrated device electronics 
currently common standard , mainly use medium size 
drive . 
one hard drive . 
asynchronous transfer : ~ max . 
lowest setting interface asynchronous mode average 
put maximum ide asynchronous mode .

interface drive use

cost scsi interface self 
: people buy scsi pc , 
turn make mass produce scsi would reduce 
cost , .

cost manufacture less item cost 
allow drive put limit drive 
ide limit put .
