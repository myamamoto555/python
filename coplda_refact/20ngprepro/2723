never work really small signal 
question low level noise . 
notice waveform 
synthesizer use analogic 2020 relatively large 
common mode noise . 
use synthesizer ` null ' another 
transient waveform amplify difference ~ several hundred 
time . 
2020 1-3 common mode noise tend 
make measurement hard repeat . 
noise quite sync 
line frequency , spectrum analyzer , main component . 
get rid noise ? 
look spectrum use 
hp audio range analyzer , noise go away minute switch 
` isolation ' input . 
guess diff amp 
input since read accurately dc . 
also , use differential amplifier ia solve problem , 
important use one ` shield driver ' amp connect 
shield sort feedback loop remove trouble cause 
different cable capacitance ? 
anyone suggest good ic ia 
use transient signal content , would 
appreciate .
