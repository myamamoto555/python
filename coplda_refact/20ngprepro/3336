purpose science produce model physical world . 

model must able explain past observation predict outcome 
future observation . 
one aim experiment carry 
well define observation objective . 
ideally scientist except model best describe world , 
model realize minimal number assumption . 

moment model rely assumption spiritual world 
exist equally powerful one assume assumption 
spiritual world . 
model fewer assumption 
currently accept model . 
scientific process never assume present model 
correct one , whereas many religion claim represent truth . 

arrogance many theist claim represent truth , 
say scientist .
