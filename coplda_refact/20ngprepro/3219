great ... nice choice bad guy 
convince everyone `` bad '' unrestricted

political opponent senior administration official 
intercept conversation ... 
kinda change interpretation event , ?

presence clipper chip change thing , 
give people talk phone false sense security , 
also give federal law enforcement agency justification 
deny use strong encryption method inconvenient . 
dang , suppose inconvenient impossible . 
sure way make sure abuse minimize 
still allow legitimate law enforcement access .

uh huh ... sure . 
predict within two month week ? 
chip 's 
debut , full technical detail post . 

impact security key escrow system , ` ve 
lie . 
cryptosystem worth salt withstand light 
public scrutiny , way sure 
algorithm `` unrecognized vulnerability '' unless half 
world try break decade . 
even , get ta
