story begin : julius caesar send message trust 
acquaintance , trust messenger . 
replace every 
c , every b d , alphabet . 
someone 
know `` shift 2 '' rule could decipher message . 
cryptosystem cipher system method disguise message 
certain people see disguise . 
cryptography 
art create use cryptosystem . 
cryptanalysis art 
break cryptosystem -- see disguise even 
suppose able . 
cryptology study 
cryptography cryptanalysis . 
original message call plaintext . 
disguise message 
call ciphertext . 
encryption mean procedure convert 
plaintext ciphertext . 
decryption mean procedure convert 
ciphertext plaintext . 
cryptosystem usually whole collection algorithm . 

algorithm label ; label call key . 
instance , 
caesar probably use `` shift n '' encryption several different 
value n. natural say n key . 
people suppose able see disguise 
call recipient . 
people enemy , opponent , interloper , 
eavesdropper , third party . 
reference start learn cryptology ? 
introduction technical matter , survey article give 
part 10 best place begin , general , 
concise , author competent people , well write . 
however , 
article mostly concern cryptology 
develop last 50 year , abstract 
mathematical historical . 
codebreakers kahn 
encyclopedic history technical detail cryptology 
mid-60 's . 
introductory cryptanalysis learn gaines 
. 
recommend especially people want 
devise encryption algorithm since common 
mistake try make system know break one . 
selection algorithm des draw attention 
many public researcher problem cryptology . 
consequently 
several textbook book serve text appear . 

book denning give good introduction broad range 
security include encryption algorithm , database security , 
access control , formal model security . 
similar comment 
apply book price & davies . 
book konheim meyer & matyas quite 
technical book . 
konheim meyer directly involve 
development des , book give thorough analysis 
des . 
konheim 's book quite mathematical , detailed analysis 
many classical cryptosystem . 
meyer matyas concentrate 
modern cryptographic method , especially pertain key management 
integration security facility computer system 
network . 
book rueppel concentrate 
application number theory algebra cryptography . 
one go cryptanalysis ? 
classical cryptanalysis involve interesting combination 
analytical reasoning , application mathematical tool , pattern 
finding , patience , determination , luck . 
best available 
textbook subject military cryptanalytic series 
. 
clear proficiency cryptanalysis , 
part , gain attempt solution give 
system . 
experience consider valuable 
perform wwii ally still 
classify . 
modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist factor integer , 
take discrete logarithm . 
traditional fare 
cryptanalyst . 
computational number theorist 
successful cryptanalyst public key system . 
brute-force search cryptographic relevance ? 
nutshell : f x y know y compute f , 
find x try every possible x. brute-force search . 
example : say cryptanalyst find plaintext corresponding 
ciphertext , know key . 
simply try encrypt 
plaintext use possible key , ciphertext match -- 
decrypt ciphertext match plaintext , whichever faster . 
every well-designed cryptosystem large key space 
brute-force search impractical . 
advance technology sometimes change consider 
practical . 
example , des , use 10 year 
, 2 ^ 56 , 10 ^ 17 , possible key . 
computation 
many operation certainly unlikely user 
mid-70 's . 
situation different today give dramatic 
decrease cost per processor operation . 
massively parallel 
machine threaten security des brute force search . 
scenario describe garron outerbridge . 
one phase sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve 
brute-force search small space possibility . 
property satisfy every strong cryptosystem ? 
security strong system reside secrecy key 
rather attempt keep algorithm secret . 
strong cryptosystem large , mention . 

unicity distance measure give minimum amount 
ciphertext must intercept uniquely identify key 
key , unicity distance much longer amount 
ciphertext intend encrypt key , system 
probably strong . 
strong cryptosystem certainly produce ciphertext appear 
random standard statistical test see , example , . 
strong cryptosystem resist know previous attack . 

system never subject scrutiny suspect . 
system pass test mention , necessarily 
strong ? 
certainly . 
many weak cryptosystem look good first . 
however , sometimes possible show cryptosystem 
strong mathematical proof . 
`` joe break system , 
also solve well-known difficult problem factor 
integer . '' 
see part 6 . 
fail , crap shoot . 
cryptosystem theoretically unbreakable , 
guarantee practice ? 
cryptanalytic method include know `` practical 
cryptanalysis '' : enemy stare 
ciphertext figure plaintext . 
instance , might 
assume `` crib '' -- stretch probable plaintext . 
crib 
correct might able deduce key decipher 
rest message . 
might exploit `` '' -- 
plaintext several cryptosystem several key . 
thus 
might obtain solution even cryptanalytic theory say 
chance . 
sometimes , cryptosystem malfunction misuse . 
one-time pad , 
example , lose security use ! 
even 
attack , enemy somehow feed plaintext 
deduce key , employ . 
see 
. 
many people still use cryptosystem 
relatively easy break ? 
know better . 
often amateur think design 
secure system , aware expert cryptanalyst 
could . 
sometimes insufficient motivation anybody 
invest work need crack system .
