four reply , see hard number , go : trace 
outside inner layer , expect , 1 oz copper , 15 amp , 
follow temperature rise versus width . 
sams ' 
`` reference data engineers , '' seventh edition , pg 5-30 , claim 
turn ... 
width temp rise 
inch degree c 
------ --------- 
.125 100 
.15 75 
.17 60 
.20 45 
.24 30

10 amp , rise .125 width 30 degree . 
power go square current , plus copper resistance go 
temperature go ... certainly .20 '' ~ 5mm trace 
ample want . 
2 ounce copper almost cut 
require width half . 
would 2 oz 0.08 '' width , 
think ... give _ rate _ current 10 amp 15 
transient fault condition . 
another question : voltage drop low enough ? 
able figure one wire table 
resistivity copper . 
keep trace short use separate 
sense trace appropriate , mention another poster .
