| one thing understand sacred make 
| temple ritual secret . 
`` sacred secret '' explanation bit misleading . 

profound reverence temple endowment , 
injunction discuss ceremony public . 

since public discussion often irreverent , mormons would rather 
keep silent cherish practice malign . 
certain element ceremony participant 
explicitly covenant reveal except conjunction 
ceremony .

| secret ritual , seem take entirely 
| pagan pre-christian mystery religion . 
interpretation christian history matter . 
one must recall know gnostics

eusebius , _ historia ecclesiastica _ ii 1:3 -4 . 
irenaeus claim information pass priest 
bishop _ heresy _ iv , eusebius disagree .

gripe thay profess 
gnosis , wrong one . 
writings deal jesus ' teaching emphasize 
secrecy -- much concealment policy teach 
certain thing indiscriminately . 
one story , simon magus open 
dialog peter nature god . 
peter 's response `` seem 
know father god : could tell 
whence soul , make ; 
permit disclose thing '' _ clementine 
recognition _ ii , 60 . 
one theme underlie _ recognition _ 
idea certain doctrine idly teach , 
certain level spiritual maturity reach . 
one approach evidence many way . 

intend everyone interpret christian history , 
believe evidence exist favorably interpret , course 
early christian rite analogous practice mormons today . 
| neither new testament 
| christianity biblical judaism make secret practice . 
judaism christianity ceremony , would expect 
read public document ? 
one search book 
mormon mormon scripture find almost information 
temple worship . 
yes , could establish mormons worship 
temple , would probably hard press characterize 
worship . 
basis , conclude bible explain 
practice might take place , absence

mormon scholar dr. hugh nibley offer list scripture 
take :

1 cor . 
3:1 -2 . 
6 . 
`` many thing ... would write paper ink ; ... 
come unto speak face face '' 2 jn . 
1:12 . 
nibley , _ since cumorah _ , pp.

actually teach openly . 
| hear joseph smith take entire 
| practice i.e. ritual secrecy surround ritual 
| freemasons . 
anybody know authoritative 
| information whether claim true ? 
historically , joseph smith temple 
endowment ceremony nearly year join freemasons . 
diary evidence support claim rite 
change smith become mason . 
argue smith 
ample exposure masonic proceedings burlesque 
time brother hyrum mason , though specific 
connection yet establish . 
conversation mason respect temple rite 
transcription appear net lead believe 
connection masonry mormonism fairly tenuous . 

moderator note , similar remove 
recent revision temple ceremony . 
believe critic 
charge mormon rite lift freemasonry 
adequate knowledge rite question .
