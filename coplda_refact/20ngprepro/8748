'll post couple day 
unless group concensus demand stop , run good 
material . 
particularly careful past save 
attribution . 
think following come john a. johnson , 
someone correct wrong . 
probably longest 
entire collection . 


prophecy 
fulfil 

consider christian religion , judge 
accord claim , important look claim 
fulfil earlier jewish prophecy . 
scribe matthew perhaps 
eager draw think prophetic answer 
career jesus nazareth . 
see , matthew 's main 
strategy take various old testament passage , often even 
promise messiah , apply circumstance 
new testament . 
must also bear mind question 
authenticity account . 
since gospel write 
least 35 year jesus execute , know much 
happen exactly state . 
, purpose analysis , 
take particular claim face value . 
immanuel : 
begin , course , beginning . 
mt : '' mary bear son , , 
joseph , name ` jesus ' mean g would 
salvation , save people 
sin . '' 
happen fulfil lord 
speak prophet : 
isaiah : day ahaz c. 750 bce , 
king judah , rezin syria israel make 
war jerusalem capitol judah , could 
quite conquer . 
house david i.e. ahaz 
court judah tell , ... 
heart heart people shake ... , 
lord g would say isaiah , `` go meet ahaz ... '' 
... lord speak ahaz prophet isaiah , 
naturally say , `` ask sign g would lord . 

deep sheol high heaven . '' 
, 
ahaz say , `` ask ; put lord 
test . '' 
isaiah say , `` hear , o house 
david . 
enough weary man , 
must weary god ? 
therefore , lord 
give sign : behold , young woman 
child bear son , name 
`` immanuel , '' mean , `` g would . '' 

eat curd honey know refuse evil 
choose good . 
, child know 
refuse evil choose good , land two king 
dread desert ... 
matthew home sentence italics . 
, hebrew word `` almah , '' young woman , 
specifically , `` virgin . '' 
, prophecy 
messiah . 
prophecy event happen 750 year 
later . 
prophecy virgin mother . 

short , jesus . 
matthew make use verse 
context , try make fit specific case mary . 

note want read prophecy general 
manner , general one , make fit mary . 
mary , 
virgin , indeed young woman child . 
course , 
fit shady problem . 
jesus , thought 
later christian g would walk among man , never call 
name , immanuel . 
christianity wish claim prophecy 
jesus , become best cut-and-paste prophecy ... second 
class prophecy . 
convincing . 
egypt : 
jesus 's birth bethlehem , matthew tell 
quick elsewhere unmentioned excursion egypt , 
wish liken jesus moses . 
escape 
allege infanticidal rampage king , herod . 
mt 2.15 ... remain death 
herod . 
fulfil lord speak : 
`` egypt son . '' 
lord really say . 
hosea 11.1 israel child , love . 
, egypt call son . 
call 
people , go ; 
keep sacrifice ba'al , keep burning 
incense idol . 
matthew conveniently omit rest hosea 's oracle . 
, 
indeed israel , call egypt , want 
return . 
history . 
jesus certainly speak 
. 
, draw kind parallel , wind 
jesus flee resist g would . 
, prophecy 
convincing matthew probably hope . 
rachel weeps : 
jesus vacation egypt , matthew say 
king herod seek kill , thus order execution 
young male child . 
matthew write , 
mt , speak 
prophet jeremiah fulfil : 
`` voice hear ramah , wail loud 
lamentation -- rachel weep child ; 
refuse console , 
. '' 
reference passage jeremiah 31.15 , refer 
carry israel exile sargon assyria 722 
bce . 
rachel , ancestor major tribe israel , ephraim , 
manasseh , say weep descendant `` 
. '' 
metaphorical , course , since rachel live die 
hebrews even egyptian exile . 
interesting note leah , rachel , 
ancestor judeans land jesus 
bethlehem . 
anyone weep `` child , '' 
leah . 
connexion rachel bethlehem 
legend bury north city , 
`` way , bethlehem . '' 
herod infanticide , rather unlikely 
event actually occur . 
one never know , 
event mention allude anywhere else bible , 
mention secular record time . 
herod particularly reign , many far less 
evil deed herod carefully record . 
might 
prime example event add jesus 's life enhance 
message church 's gospel . 
whole story 's similarity tale 
infant mose egypt , highly likely device set 
matthew add prophetic , yet artificial , approval jesus . 
surprising matthew conveniently neglect mention 
rest jeremiah quote . 
`` child '' prophet 
speak dead , exile assyrian empire . 
g would 
comfort weep rachel , say child 
return -- gather back together . 
course , 
would suit matthew 's purpose , child speak 
dead good . 
, `` prophecy '' matthew set even 
, anyone bother check , 
convincing . 
nazarene : 
even go next chapter find 
another prophecy . 
leave egypt , joseph & wife 
take infant jesus live city nazareth , 
mt 2.23 ... speak prophet 
might fulfil , `` shall call nazarene . '' 
first thing notice matthew mention name 
prophet time . 
second , ask `` '' . 
messianic prophecy speak nazarene . 
worse , 
prophecy , period , mention nazarene . 
still 
worse , nazarenes mention old testament 
. 
book judges , angel tell samson 's mother 
, 
judges 13.5 '' ... conceive bear son . 
razor 
shall tough head , nazirite 
god day birth . 
deliver israel 
hand philistines . '' 
course prophecy jesus , messiah g would . 
, best find . 
obviously , matthew 
begin go overboard cut-and-paste prophecy , 
simple make . 
bear 
disease : 
jesus next go around healing people physical illness 
disability . 
mt 8.17 fulfil speak 
prophet isaiah , `` take infirmity bear 
disease . '' 
expect , verse quote isaiah quote context , 
word skewed fit christian scheme . 
, 
53.4 surely , suffering servant , 
bear sickness , carry pain . 
reading surround passage isaiah , know 
prophet speak present tense collective nation 
israel , jehovah 's choose servant people . 
speak 
israelites suffer exile , voice gentile nation 
look upon . 
image deeply ingrain jewish 
identity -- image chastise , yet cherish , israel 
instrument nation ' salvation g would . 
verse speak israel take sickness 
literal metaphorical manifestation guilt 
discipline . 
speak `` servant '' go around 
healing people . 
notice servant isaiah take 
sickness pain nation individual jews . 
jesus , 
know , take disease onto . 

verse isaiah prophecy something come , 
rather something already happen . 
believe 
jesus take eternal punishment hell , bear 
illness heal . 
, someone might want say 
, figuratively , jesus reenact deed israel 
spiritual atonement , admit matthew 's parallel 
miss intend effect . 
silent messiah : 
upon healing multitude commoner , say jesus 
order keep quiet , presumable would arouse 
attention local ruler . 
mt fulfill speak 
prophet isaiah . 
`` behold servant choose , beloved , 
soul pleased . 
put spirit 
, announce justice gentiles . 

wrangle cry aloud , anyone hear 
voice street . 
break bruise 
reed quench smolder wick bring 
justice victory , gentile hope 
name . '' 
isaiah passage quote read , 
behold servant uphold , 
choose , soul delight . 
put 
spirit , bring forth justice 
nation . 
cry lift voice , 
make hear street . 
break 
bruise reed , quench smolder wick . 

faithfully bring forth justice . 
fail 
burn dimly discourage bruise 
establish justice earth . 
coastland 
await law . 
see , matthew conveniently leave part passage , 
suit dealings jesus . 
christian could 
never think jesus fail , never would `` light '' mankind 
burn dimly . 
, servant nation israel indeed come 
end job . 
gentile come embrace 
g would longer choose people , rather 
child g would . 
also , end phrase change 
judaic '' ... coastland await law . '' 

, `` gentiles hope name . '' 

original proclaim torah law jehovah , rewrite 
fit strange doctrine `` believe name . '' 
one 
doubt servant refer jesus , one 
read whole chapter , isaiah 42 , hear beloved 
blind imperfect servant , `` people rob 
plunder ... '' , see matthew 's attempt 
`` prophecy '' examine , crumble . 
three day 
three nights : 
come upon prophecy supposedly utter 
mouth god jesus . 
speak crucifixion 
resurrection . 
mt 12.40 jonah belly 
whale three day three night , son 
man heart earth three day 
three night . 
discussion occur , necessary know 
jews understand day . 
far day name go , 
24 hour long , last sunset 6pm follow sunset 
6pm . 
refer `` day '' period light 
6am end sunset 6pm . 
thus , accord time 
scale , sabbath day begin 6pm friday evening , last 
6pm saturday evening . 
jews celebrate 
sabbath daylight portion saturdays , instead sundays . 
seem like real miracle christian forget 
saturday indeed seventh last day week ! 
thus , 
day night refer together , 12 hour daylight 
portion 12 hour night period speak . 
thus , 
jesus say grave , hell , otherwise 
three day three night . 
good book tell , jesus crucify `` ninth 
hour , '' 3pm , friday afternoon . 
put 
grave sometime . 
, jesus leave grave , `` rise , '' 
dawn call sunday dawn sabbath 
. 
mean jesus , use time 
clarity , grave 6pm friday night time 
6am sunday morning . 
could also add little time 6pm 
friday , since bible specific . 
mean 
use jewish time grave one day , two 
night , possibly couple hour one day . 
certainly 
problem jesus prediction . 
absolutely way 
even able death involve three day three 
night -- even use modern time measurement . 
lead 
suspect error another one matthew 's little 
mistake , gospel writer put false word 
god 's mouth . 
matter make prediction , 
unconvincing ... . 
hearing & 
understand : 
jesus tool habit speak vast audience 
parable -- story deeper meaning could find , 
already one elect , choose understand 
message jesus . 
reason understand 
parable one want . 
people understand 
, need bother , since 
accept `` plain '' message better . 
matthew say , 
mt audience indeed 
fulfil prophecy isaiah say , 
`` indeed hear never understand ; 
indeed see , never perceive . 

people 's heart grow dull , ear heavy 
hearing , shut eye 
would perceive , ear , 
understand heart , turn heal 
. '' 
original isaiah passage part earlier work , 
call ministry . 
740 bce , israel 
flourish , right fall authority assyria . 
isaiah see good time end , also vision g would , 
call bring reform israel judah . 
g would say , `` go , say 
people , ` hear hear , understand ; see 
see , perceive . ' 
make heart 
people fat , make ear heavy , shut 
eye , see eye , hear 
ear , understand heart , 
turn heal . '' 
isaiah say , `` long , 
lord ? '' 
say , `` city lie waste 
without inhabitant , house without man , 
land utterly desolate , take man far 
away , forsake place many land . 

though tenth remain , burn 
, like terebinth oak whose stump still 
stand tree fell . '' 
holy seed 
stump . 
see really g would cause people israel 
stop listen prophet 's warning , reaffirm 
promise make solomon 's david 's . 
read 
rest isaiah , find fulfil plan 
g would use israel servant , light nation . 
look 
isaiah , 48.20 , 49.3 
see matthew cut-and-paste little portion 
isaiah 's verse , suit gospel need . 
, 
alter word , make fit people 
understand jesus 's story . 
, see , isaiah 's verse 
prophecy , rather command g would , 
present . 
, matthew 's prophecy fall flat face . 
matthew try make jesus 's parable look like 
prophetic approval . 
mt 13.35 ... say nothing without 
parable . 
fulfil speak 
prophet , `` open mouth parable . 

utter hide since 
foundation world . '' 
matthew really botch . 
attempt quote 
prophet , psalms . 
p open mouth parable . 

utter dark saying old , thing 
hear know , thing father tell . 
hide child , tell 
come generation glorious deed 
lord ... 
point , verse psalms really come 
prophet . 
might also want know earlier copy 
matthew 's gospel even insert isaiah 's name prophet . 
apparently , later scribe catch error try cover 
. 
perhaps significant part , 
, matthew alter old testament scripture . 
jesus 
say earlier , speak parable 
understand . 
parable psalm hide . 
, speak thing `` know , father tell 
. '' 
jesus deal thing `` hide since foundation 
world . '' 
indeed jesus deal lot secrecy confusion . 
direct opposition parable psalms . 

wonder matthew rewrite ! 
still , 
matthew 's artificial prophecy fall flat face . 
, 
christian rarely look . 
matthew 's prophecy 
thing christianity begin look bad . 
excuses 
little faith : 
mt. , see disciple able go 
around cast demon , except one case . 
know 
epilepsy , people think disease 
demon . 
wonder disciple 
unable `` dispossess '' epileptic . 
, jesus , perhaps 
enlighten , report rebuke , say 
enough faith . 
seem strange . 

demon special ? 
seem either true believer faith 
. 
apparently , enough faith allow someone move 
mountain . 
course , find one , day 
move real mountain . 
one part sea .

yet , life go .

god use reveal man

thing ; 
see . 
, say everybody 
little faith . 
jesus ride 
ass : 
shortly accept role jewish messiah 
king , jesus request donkey bring ride 
jerusalem . 
mt 21.5 take place fulfil speak 
prophet , say , 
tell daughter zion , `` behold , king 
come , humble , mount ass , 
. '' 
course , passage quote zechariah 9.9 read little 
differently . 
lo , king come ; triumphant 
victorious , humble , ride ass , ass - 
colt ... command peace nation . 
much difference , except zechariah 
involve one animal -- -- matthew read 
poetic wording slightly differently . 
thus , jesus call 
colt adult ass . 
matthew 's version , get 
comical picture divine christ sweating straddle two 
donkey . 
could inevitably lead theological , 
dilemma ! 
find account write 
earlier st. mark , colt call bring 
jesus . 
indeed fit verse zechariah properly , 
show matthew attempt use prophetic verse , 
bungle . 
, exclude many respectable christian meet , 
notice christ think ride ass , 
situation often reversed nowadays ... 
, enter jerusalem temple , priest 
anger people youngster call jesus messiah . 
, 
jesus reply might expect matthew , 
mt 21.16 read ? 
` mouth 
babe suckling thou bring perfect praise . ' 
likely matthew make response since jesus 
never one point little `` prophetic '' thing 
since , might expect , quote error , seem 
fit matthew 's track record quite well . 
might ask jesus 
matthew , `` read ? '' 
source read , 
psalms o yahweh lord , majestic 
name whole world ! 
, whose glory 
chant heaven babe infant , 
found bulwark foe still 
enemy avenger . 
passage hardly need comment . 
`` perfect praise '' 
speak psalm , praise give g would , 
messiah king , jesus . 
mention , seem 
one case matthew 's pen make convenient prophetic 
scripture . 
say 
lord ... : 
jesus say ask promise jewish 
descend . 
jews agree -- king 
david . 
, jesus counter quote psalm 110 , 
`` lord say lord , sit right hand , 
put enemy foot . '' 
take face value , jesus deny necessity davidic 
descent . 
one assume opposition answer . 

course , christian answer agree , try 
make hidden point , reveal mystery divine 
nature . 
tempting believe , one 
christian interested matter investigation . 
, problem . 
jesus 's time , psalm think 
messiah . 
, easy see david might refer 
messiah superior . 
need look scripture 
messiah see expect great king , 
bring jews time even better david 's 
rule . 
course , jews listen good answer , 
passage could indeed refer divine messiah , 
christian worship . 
problem lie meaning 
psalm , error apparently several jews jesus 's time 
also make . 
one must remember various faction 
among jews , often result different expectation 
. 
jesus apparently one adventist , like 
audience , think messiah 's advent imminent , 
interpret psalms 110 , among , messianic . 
problem , ? 
psalm 110 literally read , 
's utterance lord : 
`` sit right hand , make enemy 
footstool . '' 
send forth mighty scepter zion . 
rule 
midst foe ! 
people offer 
freely day lead host 
holy mountain . 
`` priest order melchizedek 
forever . '' 
word `` lord '' often mistakenly capitalize christian 
bible denote divinity lord . 
, hebrew , 
word `` , '' capitalization exist . 
adoni simply mean 
`` lord , '' generic term would use . 
use often 
scripture refer king g 'd . 
merely 
address respect . 
nothing text imply word 
refer either divinity . 

suppose write david certain . 
title 
psalm translate either `` psalm david , '' `` psalm 
david . '' 
seem fitting assume write court 
poet , david 's covenant endorsement g would . 

psalm write david , unlikely would 
talk messiah . 
idea perfect king , descend 
david , present david 's age . 
extensive 
tale david 's doings saying -- none include 
praise messiah . 
many psalm show evidence write long 
david dead , time exile g would put show 
favor david 's kingdom hold . 
description psalm fit david well . 
david 
promise g rise power , victory enemy , 
successful judgement among nation conquer . 
achieve 
priesthood common melchizedek righteous king , 
enable bless people . 
fit . 
blame problem matthew alone , 
though . 
, artificial prophecy allude , though 
use scripture rather questionable . 
still , 
event common gospel . 
, let matthew 
little easily time . 
interesting note , 
though , matthew dress event . 
earlier gospel 
mark tell tale jesus simply speak crowd . 
matthew pharisees , become religious competition 
infant christianity , target jesus 's question . 

might expect , matthew write event end 
embarrass pharisees . 
power pen . 
moses & jesus , 
together 
along ... : 
leave gospel story matthew momentarily see 
john 's gospel . 
gospel story john 
deserve special treatment , seem far remove 
real event jesus 's career tell even matthew . 
, moment , look one verse . 
early 
church leader found religion jewish hope messiah 
king , artificial extension original promise make 
g 'd . 
construct history abraham , moses write 
promise land nationhood jewish people . 

accomplish eventually , rule king david , 
christian come along later decide would claim 
fulfillment promise . 
, , expand 
promise , preach heavenly kingdom . 
john 8.56 j.c. speaking father , abraham , 
rejoice see day . 
say glad . 
would nice tie approval jesus abraham , , 
abraham know nothing jesus messiah , anything christian . 
try , fail find event old testament 
correspond john 's little prophecy . 
par 
course see st. john make old testament backing , like 
forerunner matthew . 
many christian know faith 
many foundation fraud , surprising 
still cling . 
potter 's 
field : 
tell jesus betray jerusalem 
one follower , judas iscariot . 
matthew write , 
mt throw piece silver 
temple , judas depart ... , chief 
priest , take silver , say , `` lawful 
put treasury , since blood 
money . '' 
... buy potter 's field 
bury stranger ... fulfil 
speak prophet jeremiah , 
`` take thirty piece silver , price 
price set 
son israel , give potter 's 
field , lord direct . '' 
prophecy utterly gross old testament 
scripture . 
first , matthew make mistake regard name 
prophet . 
zechariah utter verse 
matthew make use . 
zech . 
... weigh wages , 
thirty shekel silver . 
say , `` cast 
treasury , '' -- lordly price 
pay . 
take thirty shekel 
silver cast treasury house 
. 
first , verse zechariah deal betrayer 
messiah , g would . 
deal shepherd , likely 
priest , choose serve function preside people 
shortly g would would send judah israel conflict 
one another . 
word , `` treasury , '' replace king 
james scholars `` potter , '' precisely make 
matthew 's quote fit better . 
, blatant error . 

correct translation hebrew indeed `` treasury , '' also 
make perfect sense zechariah 's context , whereas `` potter 's 
field '' totally unrelated . 
whether mistranslation 
intentional seem beyond speculation . 
however , give 
matthew 's track record , one find hard resist notion 
intentional dishonesty . 
course , matthew would ample reason alter 
text . 
thirty piece silver match judas 's situation , 
christian seem , reader willing disregard 
contextual incongruity , matthew might another prophecy 
toss around . 
however , correct translation zechariah 
directly contradict situation juda high 
priest . 
high priest would put money 
treasury . 
worthless shepherd zechariah exactly 
opposite ! 
course , average bible student , 
`` prophecy '' present matthew would take new 
testament face value . 
, matthew 's work convince 
enough . 
wine , vinegar , 
& casting lots : 
, jesus lead away crucify . 
mt ... give vinegar drink , 
mingle gall ; taste , would 
drink . 
, crucify , 
divide garment among cast lot : 
might fulfil speak prophet , 
`` part garment among , upon 
cast lot . '' 
first , vinegar offer jesus actually common sour 
wine , type roman soldier drink regularly . 
find 
right jesus die , soldier give 
drink -- polluted gall . 
jn jesus ... say , `` thirst . '' 
bowl 
vinegar stand , put sponge full 
vinegar hyssop hold mouth . 

receive vinegar , say , `` finish ; '' 
, matthew seem draw , passage 
prophet , one psalms . 
p look pity , none ; 
comforter , find none . 
give 
poison food light . 
put gall meat , 
thirst , give vinegar drink ... add 
punishment upon punishment , may 
acquittal thee . 
let blot 
book live . 
course , sour wine offer jesus request 
drink . 
indeed seem show pity . 
psalm 
quote david political military enemy . 

messiah jesus . 
surprising 
run problem see `` jesus '' 
psalm ask g would damnation `` , '' whereas 
jesus gospel say , 
lk 23.34 jesus say , `` father , forgive , 
know ! '' 
, matthew miss attempt create prophecy 
gall bitter substance put jesus 's drink , 
meat , psalm stipulate . 
`` prophecy '' vinegar faulty , naturally 
ask , `` casting lot ? '' 
bring 22nd 
psalm , deserve discussion . 
suffice 
say fact jesus 's clothes divide tell 
great thing . 
turn happen often felon 
day . 
soon see , perhaps least 
erroneous passage psalm apply jesus . 

indeed bring interesting question quality 
jesus 's clothes . 
man remove worldly possession , 
ownership clothes worthy cast lot raise 
suspicion . 
22nd psalm : 
psalm attribute david , lament 
condition attack enemy . 
become song 
praise hope . 
take context , part 
seem fit plight jesus crucifixion quite well . 

examine primary passage . 
verse 1-2 : god , god ! 
forsake ?! 
far help , far word 
groan ? 
oh , god , cry day , 
answer , night , find rest . 
jesus say cry first sentence cross . 
suggest whole psalm really jesus , rather 
king david . 
course , rest first stanza 
fit nicely jesus execution . 
jesus picture 
complain whole ordeal , suppose like `` 
lamb lead mute shearer . '' 
indeed , jesus much 
groan , even cross . 
certainly cry 
day night cross . 
6-8 : , worm , man -- scorn man ... 
see mock . 
make face wag 
head ; `` commit cause . 
let 
deliver ... delight . '' 
seem fit jesus 's execution pretty well , 
exception holy messiah call worm . 
12-13 : many bull encompass ... open 
mouth widely like ravening roar lion . 
16-18 : yea , dog round , company 
evildoer , pierce hand 
foot . 
see bone ... divide 
garment among , cast lose raiment . 
19-21 : , , far away ! 
... deliver 
soul sword , life power 
dog ! 
save mouth lion , 
afflict soul horn wild bull ! 
would seem quite convincing , sure early christian 
father write prophecy think . 
unfortunately , 
prophecy fatal flaw . 
word `` pierce '' really 
exist psalm . 
correct hebrew translation , 
16 : yea , dog round , company 
evildoer encircle , like lion , 
hand foot ... 
hebrew phrase `` like lion '' rare verb form 
mean `` pierce '' differ one phonetic character . 

word hebrew text literally , `` like lion '' , 
make sense context , even fit animal 
imagery employ psalm writer . 
convenience 
would urge christian change word `` . '' 
, 
add need yet artificial weight `` prophecy '' 
christian translator choose . 

correct translation eliminate psalm refer 
jesus , absence say much honesty 
translator . 
apart erroneous verse 16 , psalm lend 
jesus easily . 
verse 20 speak sufferer 
save sword rather cross . 
naturally fit 
psalm 's true subject , king david . 
side note , know 
crucifixion pierce hand , palm , rather 
forearm . 
say much favor traditional 
thought resurrect jesus show disciple scar 
palm . 
, fact bind religious belief . 
matthew escape culpability time , 
attempt draw many direct link psalm lord 
jesus . 
psalm , like many , mind 
gospel writer compile story 
interpretation jesus 's life death . 
much 
scripture may contribute actually get write 
question serious repercussion christian 
theology . 
easy see , faithful 
fundamentalist , event new testament might 
`` enhance '' scribe eager matthew . 
, 
less speculate simply investigate scriptural 
matter prophetic claim . 
far , say good 
thing st. matthew . 
reference pierce look lot like jesus 's 
crucifixion . 
john 's gospel recount , write 70 year 
fact , tell jesus 's execution , 
jn one soldier pierce 
side spear , come blood water ... 
thing take place scripture fulfil ... 
`` look pierce . '' 
course , build passage take blatantly 
context . 
prophet zechariah tell much nation 
israel split jerusalem judah go war 
. 
zc give victory judah ... 
day , seek destroy nation 
come jerusalem judah . 

pour spirit compassion supplication ... 
jerusalem look 
pierce , mourn , weep bitterly 
like weep firstborn child . 
john 's attempt make prophecy perhaps weaker 
matthew 's attempt . 
matthew , least , usually 
one passage . 
john 's error grossly obvious 
blatant . 
speak well gospel 
writer , help show prophetic aspect 
religion found . 
reckon 
transgressors : 
arrest , jesus quickly execute claim 
jewish kingship , . 
accord one version 
gospel tale , jesus get execute along two thief . 
mk 15.27 crucify two robber , 
one right , one left . 

scripture fulfil say , 
`` reckon transgressor . '' 
, mark try link jesus passage isaiah 53 , 
servant nation israel . 
passage 
messiah , one read whole chapter isaiah 53 , 
surround chapter , one see servant nation . 

verse also servant go 
past , prediction come , event . 

servant think criminal . 
also happen fit 
description jesus . 
passage really 
messiah , still clear execute jesus 
two thief would fulfill `` prophecy '' isaiah . 
jesus would 
fittingly fulfill whole ministry . 

consider blasphemer troublemaker throughout 
career . 
lock onto single event rather poor way 
steal prophecy , least case , see mark could 
make better analogy general comparison . 
mark go tell `` crucify 
jesus also revile . '' 
15.32 expect 
couple robber . 
course later recount , st. luke 
decide change thing . 
luke tell , 
lk one criminal hang 
rail , `` messiah ?! 
save 
, ! '' 
certainly fit mark 's recount , tell 
people crucify jesus say , `` save ! '' 

robber . 
luke go , 
criminal rebuke first say , 
`` fear g would , since 
sentence condemnation ? 
, indeed justly , 
receive due reward deed . 
, man nothing wrong . 
say , 
`` jesus , remember come kingdom . '' 
jesus answer , `` verily say , today 
paradise . '' 
, little dialogue seem highly contrived . 
stretch 
imagination bit see picture one ruffian rebuke 
fellow criminal eloquent speech . 
rather 
strange picture criminal lament goodness 
punishment justness suffering . 
man , 
apparently noble principle , seem likely 
robber . 
wonder amount theatric create 
luke . 
course , luke 's recount also disagree mark 's . 
luke one criminal revile jesus , . 
easy 
enough discount discrepancy account make 
, wish believe part error free 
word g would avenue open . 
yet another 
example writer try take old testament passage 
expand reinterpret suit theology . 
case , 
embroidery create embarrassing problem , 
see . 
end 
world -- 
mt. 24 : 
come perhaps one extraordinary 
embarrassing passage new testament . 
find 
three synoptic gospel story , cast 
unfavourable doubt whole theory christianity . 
jesus 
mention destruction jewish temple building , 
disciple ask , end world 
warn . 
disciple : tell , temple 's 
destruction , sign 
come , close age ? 
jesus : take care one lead astray , 
many come name , say , `` christ . '' 
... hear war rumor war ... 
must take place , end yet . 
, 
nation rise nation ... 
beginning . 
deliver ... put death , 
false prophet arise lead many astray . 
... endure end save . 

gospel preach throughout whole world , 
testimony nation , end come . 
, see desolation speak 
prophet daniel , ... let judea flee 
mountain . 
immediately tribulation day , 
sun darken ... star fall 
heaven ... appear sign son man 
heaven , tribe earth mourn , 
see son man come ... send 
angel ... gather elect ... 
learn lesson fig tree : soon 
branch become tender put forth leave , know 
summer near . 
also , see 
thing , know near , 
gate . 
truly say , generation 
pass away thing take place ... 
, day hour , one know ; 
angel , son , father ... therefore , 
also must ready , son man come 
hour expect . 
, clear jesus think world would 
within lifetime least disciple . 
tell 
although know exact day hour , 
come , thus must ready . 
theologian wet 
pants panic find way holy error . 
, unfortunately , jesus make explicit . 
tell 
disciple generation would still around end , 
particular prepare , prepare 
sweep away . 
resort remove inerrant 
nature bible , say phrase , `` generation 
shall pass away ... '' really mean `` race people 
pass away ... '' course , word generation use many 
time refer exactly , generation disciple . 
interesting notion god decide learn greek , 
learn well enough make clear . 
. 

quite obvious rest dialogue disciple 
least suppose live end world . 
charge mistranslation completely blow away look 
apostles ' response . 
become abundantly clear 
rev. 22.7 , 1 peter 4.7 , 1 john 2.18 , rev. 22.20 , jesus 
mean exactly say . 
end near . 
2,000 year , christian rationalise 24th 
chapter matthew , ignore meaning altogether . 
2,000 
year , wait execute leader come back , 
hearing war , rumor war , sure come soon . 
surely must . 
must wait . 
imagine 
tired must , sit around , holy , wait 
right moment spring ? 
, shortly crucifixion , jesus nazareth , 
, die . 
say three day , 
three day three night , three period time , three 
eternal seconds -- three whatever decide make 
less trouble -- see , resurrect , glowing divine 
radiance . 
saviour decide best 
interest new religion stick around , therefore 
disappear sight heaven . 
story go , anyway . 
see , many thing attribute jesus 
people get around write gospel story . 
, 
jesus prophecy scripture . 

see , though , matter quite shaky . 
, throughout 
church history , christian hold fast faith , simple 
belief . 
doctrinal objection could solve 
argumentation brute force , faith forgetfulness keep away 
question . 
question investigate never 
easiest way treat matter . 
thus 2,000 year , 
prophecy cite new testament go largely 
accept . 
thing may well continue way time . 
pause moment consider way doctrine christianity 
accept use properly improperly support 
war persecution , suppose one prophecy 
christianity securely keep hold . 
mt 10.34 jesus : `` think come 
bring peace earth . 
come bring peace , 
rather sword . ''
