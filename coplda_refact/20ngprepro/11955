eisa machine understand 
eisa video card match performance isa 
counterpart . 
instance , eisa orchid pro designer 
`` fast '' isa diamond plus , 
would call `` fast . '' 

understand eisa video card , group , 
level performance local bus card , give eisa video 
card 32 bit bus move datum around , instead isa 's 8 bit .

eisa two maybe 3 time

would expect eisa board twice fast isa 
board . 
move datum path twice wide 
least , difference number clock require 
bus transaction two bus . 
isa board require 
multiple clock per bus transaction -- typically around 3-4 . 
eisa board suppose able ` burst ' 1:1 rate , 
would expect performance isa card . 
guess , , question unanswered still . 
would expect 
able see 6x speed difference , apparently 
.
