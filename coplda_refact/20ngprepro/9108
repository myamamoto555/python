better yet , instead thrash around dos file system , take 
step . 
write minimal `` file system '' program 
use file , , list 
directory . 
put util , password protect , floppy . 
catch storage space use util part 
dos file system . 
instead , defrag disk , thus pack 
allocate cluster cluster . 
use back end 
partition hold ` stealth ' file system . 
, leave small 2nd 
partition disk assign dos . 
another approach 
might use directory contain set invariant file 
system file , instance . 
due dos allocate minimum storage 
unit `` cluster '' unused physical space disk 
tail end file end associate cluster . 

dead space could use hold stealth file 
system . 
situation encrypted datum `` appear '' 
disk .
