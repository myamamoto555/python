bandwidth unlikely problem , except wet string network . 
one major flaw x horrendous number transaction 
hence process switch force upon host . 
actual measurement 
hourly average 5 per second per log user , lead 
20-50 process switch depend whether event 
filter window manager well application 
many process need character . 
blinking cursor need application networking 
process , add transaction , add something like 
10 process switch per second per user . 
significant increase 
overhead , especially application may quite large working 
set . 
want rapidly blinking cursor , could many 
50 . 
want go , would start !
