course , inevitably tend attract evangelical christian 
look someone convert . 
reader newsgroup 
want preach , although seem derive perverse pleasure 
tear apart particularly ill-considered uninformed posting . 

subject : hitler atheist ! 
typical post : 
hitler atheist , look ! 
response : 
adolf hitler emphatically atheist . 
say : 
man , particular , sacred duty , 
denomination , make _ _ 
's _ , _ 's _ , _ _ 
's _ . 
_ orig . 
ital . 
god 's give man form , essence , 
ability . 
anyone destroy work declare war 
lord 's creation , divine . 
therefore , let every man 
active , denomination please , let every 
man take first sacred duty oppose anyone 
activity word deed step outside confines 
religious community try butt . 
... 
hence today believe act accordance 
almighty creator : _ , _ _ 
. 
_ orig . 
ital . 
-- adolf hitler , `` mein kampf '' , trans . 
ralph mannheim . 
course , someone bad believe something make belief 
wrong . 
also entirely possible hitler lie claim 
believe god . 
certainly conclude atheist , 
though . 

subject : bible prove 
typical post : 
bible say ... 
response : 
reader feel bible questionable 
accuracy , write thousand year ago many author 
record oral tradition exist many year . 
thus , claim 
` truth ' questionable legitimacy . 
say 
bible truth ; simply truth must examine 
accept . 
many reader group also feel passage 
subject `` interpretation '' , claim passage ` mean ' one thing 
one thing legitimate . 
note feeling tend extend book . 
also remarkable many atheist theist tend ignore 
equally plausible religious book favor religion . 

subject : pascal 's wager 
typical post : 
believe god turn incorrect , lose nothing -- 
believe god turn incorrect , go 
hell . 
therefore foolish atheist . 
response : 
argument know pascal 's wager . 
several flaw . 
firstly , indicate religion follow . 
indeed , 
many mutually exclusive contradictory religion . 
often 
describe `` avoid wrong hell '' problem . 
person 
follower religion x , may end religion y 's version hell . 
secondly , statement `` believe god turn 
incorrect , lose nothing '' true . 
suppose believe 
wrong god -- true god might punish foolishness . 
consider also death result people reject medicine 
favor prayer . 
another flaw argument base assumption 
two possibility equally likely -- least , 
comparable likelihood . 
, fact , possibility god 
close zero , argument become much less persuasive . 
sadly 
argument likely convince believe already . 
also , many feel intellectually honest people , belief base 
evidence , amount intuition . 
matter 
cost-benefit analysis . 
formally speak , argument consist four statement : 
1 . 
one know whether god exist . 
2 . 
believe god bad one 's eternal soul god 
exist . 
3 . 
believe god consequence god exist . 
4 . 
therefore one 's interest believe god . 
two approach argument . 
first view 1 
assumption , 2 consequence . 
one problem approach , 
abstract , create information information . 

consider invalid information theory . 
statement 1 indicate one 
information god -- statement 2 indicate beneficial information 
gain absolute lack information god . 
violate 
information entropy -- information extract information , 
`` cost '' . 
alternative approach claim 1 2 assumption . 

problem 2 basically assumption state 
christian position , christian agree assumption . 

argument thus collapse `` christian , interest 
believe god '' -- rather vacuous tautology , way pascal 
intend argument view . 
biggest reason pascal 's wager failure god 
omniscient certainly know really believe believe 
wager . 
spurn latter ... assume actually care 
whether people believe . 

subject : occam 's razor ? 
typical post : 
people keep talk occam 's razor . 
? 
response : 
william occam formulate principle become know occam 's 
razor . 
original form , say `` multiply entity 
unnecessarily . '' 
, explain something without suppose 
existence entity , . 
nowadays people refer occam 's razor , generally express 
generally , example `` take simplest solution '' . 
relevance atheism look two possible explanation 
see around : 
1 . 
incredibly intricate complex universe , 
come result natural process . 
2 . 
incredibly intricate complex universe , 
also god create universe . 
clearly god must 
non-zero complexity . 
give explanation fit fact , occam 's razor might suggest 
take simpler two -- solution number one . 
unfortunately , argue third even simple solution : 
3 . 
incredibly intricate complex universe . 
imagine . 
third option lead logically towards solipsism , many people 
find unacceptable . 

subject : good believe jesus 
typical post : 
want tell people virtue benefit religion . 
response : 
preaching appreciate . 
feel free talk religion , please write posting 
`` conversion '' theme . 
posting belong 
reject try newsgroup 
. 
would doubtless welcome posting atheist favorite 
newsgroup attempt convert ; please unto would 
unto ! 
often theist make basic claim god form lengthy 
analogy parable . 
aware atheist hear god know 
basic claim ; sole purpose parable tell 
atheist god exist bring salvation , may well post , 
since tell nothing tell . 

subject : know god exist 
typical post : 
know personal experience prayer god exist . 
response : 
many theist personal evidence worship 
exist , many atheist personal evidence 
exist . 
evidence vary person person . 
furthermore , without wish dismiss evidence hand , many 
people claim kind unlikely thing -- 
abducted ufo , visit ghost elvis , . 

subject : einstein `` god play dice '' 
typical post : 
albert einstein believe god . 
think cleverer ? 
response : 
einstein comment `` god play dice universe '' . 
quotation commonly mention show einstein believe 
christian god . 
use way , context ; refer einstein 's 
refusal accept uncertainty indicate quantum theory . 
furthermore , 
einstein 's religious background jewish rather christian . 
better quotation show einstein think god following : 
`` believe spinoza 's god reveal orderly harmony 
exist , god concern fate action 
human . '' 
einstein unable accept quantum theory belief 
objective , orderly reality ; reality would subject random 
event would dependent upon observer . 
believe 
qm incomplete , better theory would need 
statistical interpretation . 
far better theory find , 
much evidence suggest never . 
longer quote einstein appear `` science , philosophy , religion , 
symposium '' , publish conference science , philosophy religion 
relation democratic way life , inc. , new york , 1941 . 

say : 
`` man imbue order regularity event 
firmer become conviction room leave side 
order regularity cause different nature . 

neither rule human rule divine exist 
independent cause natural event . 
sure , doctrine 
personal god interfere natural event could never 
refute italics , real sense , science , 
doctrine always take refuge domain scientific 
knowledge yet able set foot . 
convince behavior part representative 
religion would unworthy also fatal . 
doctrine 
maintain clear light dark , 
necessity lose effect mankind , incalculable harm 
human progress . 
struggle ethical good , teacher 
religion must stature give doctrine personal 
god , , give source fear hope past 
place vast power hand priest . 
labor 
avail force capable 
cultivate good , true , beautiful humanity 
. 
, sure , difficult incomparably 
worthy task ... '' 
einstein also say : 
`` , course , lie read religous conviction , 
lie systematically repeat . 
believe 
personal god never deny express clearly . 
something call religious 
unbounded admiration structure world far 
science reveal . '' 
latter quote `` albert einstein : human side '' , edit helen 
dukas hoffman , publish princeton university press . 
also book : 
`` believe immortality individual , consider ethic 
exclusively human concern superhuman authority behind 
. '' 
course , fact einstein choose believe christianity 
imply christianity false . 

subject : everyone worship something 
typical post : 
everyone worship something , whether money , power god . 
response : 
true , everyone polytheist . 
theist care much 
thing atheist care . 
atheist ' reaction 
example family amount worship theist ' . 

subject : must cause 
typical post : 
set integer lower bind smallest member , 
chain cause must first element , cause . 
response : 
set real number greater zero definite lower bind , 
smallest member . 
, even true must cause , 
imply cause must conscious supernatural entity , 
especially entity must match description favor 
particular religion . 

subject : universe complex must design 
typical post : 
presence design universe prove god . 
surely 
think appear chance ? 
response : 
know argument design . 
matter dispute whether element design 
universe . 
believe complexity diversity living 
creature earth evidence creator best advise read 
newsgroup . 
insufficient space summarize side debate . 
however , conclusion scientific evidence favor 
so-called scientific creationism . 
furthermore , much evidence , 
observation theory explain many complexity 
universe life earth . 
origin argument design feeling existence 
something incredibly intricate , say , human improbable 
surely come chance ; surely must 
external intelligence direct thing human come chaos 
deliberately . 
human intelligence improbable , surely existence mind 
capable fashion entire universe complete conscious must 
immeasurably unlikely ? 
approach use argue favor 
existence creator turn around apply creationist 
position . 
lead familiar theme `` creator create universe , 
create creator ? '' 
, addition spiral 
improbability . 
way declare creator 
create `` '' `` '' . 
might well ask wrong say universe 
`` '' without introduce creator ? 
indeed stephen hawking , book 
`` brief history time '' , explain theory universe close 
finite extent , beginning end . 
argument design often state analogy , so-called 
watchmaker argument . 
one ask imagine one find watch 
beach . 
one assume create watchmaker , 
evolve naturally ? 
course one assume watchmaker . 
yet like 
watch , universe intricate complex ; , argument go , 
universe must creator . 
watchmaker analogy suffer three particular flaw , 
common argument design . 
firstly , watchmaker create 
watch pre-existing material , whereas god claim 
create universe nothing . 
two sort creation 
clearly fundamentally different , analogy therefore rather weak . 
secondly , watchmaker make watch , many thing 
world . 
walk along beach find nuclear 
reactor , would assume create watchmaker . 
argument 
would therefore suggest multitude creator , responsible 
different part creation . 
finally , first part watchmaker argument conclude 
watch part nature order , therefore 
stand randomness nature . 
yet second part 
argument , start position universe obviously 
random , show element order . 
watchmaker argument thus 
internally inconsistent . 

subject : independent evidence bible true 
typical post : 
event new testament confirm independent documentary 
evidence . 
example ... 
response : 
writings josephus often mention independent documentary 
evidence . 
early version josephus 's work think mention jesus 
james ; extant version discuss john non-christian context . 
many 
scholar believe original mention jesus james pass , 
expand christian copyist . 
several `` reconstruction '' 
original text publish effect . 
much information appear ecclesiastical history eusebius 320 
c.e. . 
worthless historical material deliberate 
falsification wily eusebius generally acknowledge ` 
first thoroughly dishonest historian antiquity . ' 
eusebius 
generally give title authorship material . 
aside new testament , biographical information jesus 
well-documented . 
information , please consult frequently 
ask questions file newsgroup . 

subject : godel 's incompleteness theorem 
typical post : 
godel 's incompleteness theorem demonstrate impossible 
bible true complete . 
response : 
godel 's first incompleteness theorem say consistent formal 
system sufficiently expressive model ordinary 
arithmetic , one formulate expression never prove 
valid invalid ` true ' ` false ' within formal system . 
technically 
speak , system must also recursive ; , must decision 
procedure determine whether give string axiom within formal 
system . 
essentially , system formulate know `` liar 
paradox . '' 
classic liar paradox sentence ordinary english `` 
sentence false . '' 
note proposition undecidable , formal 
system even deduce undecidable . 
logic use theological discussion rarely well define , claim 
godel 's incompleteness theorem demonstrate impossible 
prove disprove existence god worthless isolation . 
one trivially define formal system possible prove 
existence god , simply existence god state axiom . 
unlikely view atheist convincing proof , however . 
may possible succeed produce formal system build axiom 
atheist theist agree . 
may possible show 
godel 's incompleteness theorem hold system . 
however , 
would still demonstrate impossible prove god exist 
within system . 
furthermore , certainly would tell anything 
whether possible prove existence god generally . 
note also hypothetical formal system tell nothing 
actual existence god ; formal system abstraction . 
another frequent claim godel 's incompleteness theorem demonstrate 
religious text bible , book mormon whatever 
consistent universally applicable . 
religious text formal 
system , claim nonsense .
