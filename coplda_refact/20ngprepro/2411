honestly hold tripe charley ? 
start enough 
current version bible make comparison show write 
utter garbage . 
witness jw , mormon , catholic , anglican , greek 
orthodox bible . 
really convince would take good 
old library . 
local library 1804 king james compare 
brand new , hot god 's tongue good news bible . 
genesis almost 
unrecognisable , many four gospel 
edit good news bible . 
fact god good news much 
congenial fellow must say . 
like 'll get 1804 king james actually give 
quote . 
least heading change much .
