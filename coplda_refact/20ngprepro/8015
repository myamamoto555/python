mean absolutely idea assumption . 
however greatly extoll mary , quite obvious 
way god even part god equal god . 
assumption 
blessed mother , mean close identification 
redemptive work christ , assume note 
ascend body soul heaven , thus one , along 
elijah , enoch , moses maybe ???? 
already perfect 
heaven . 
obviously , virgin mary far superior glorification 
previously mention personage . 
jung stick psychology rather get theology .
