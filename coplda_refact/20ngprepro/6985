blacks + - 2 % crime report rate , arrest rate , incarceration 
rate violent crime . 
doubt violent crime , inherent bias mechanism 
present . 
wider discrepancy crime black wrt 3 category . 
interestingly enough , discrepancy largest southern 
united states -- black incarcerate well average 
rest united states ! 
point wrt 
black . 
case , violent crime burglary drug selling , black 
report 53 % , arrest 44 % , present 47 % 1988 . 
consider 12 % population black , 6 % black male , 
percentage age group , 
situation remember old calculation right 4 % 
population commit almost half really nasty crime . 
blacks similar history crime whites get sentence , 
except south , receive around 20 % less paper !!

environmental disaster .
