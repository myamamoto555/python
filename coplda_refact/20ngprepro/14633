indeed , immediate context nasb : 
26 otherwise , would need suffer often 
since foundation world ; 
consummation manifest put away 
sin sacrifice . 
27 inasmuch appoint man die 
, come judgement ; 
28 christ also , offer bear 
sin many , shall appear second time , 
bear sin , tro eagerly await . 
first point verse part even larger 
context , subject destiny 
individual human soul rather singular nature christ 's 
sacrifice , `` '' , fulfillment law fall 
mankind . 
rudolf elaborate detail 
`` christianity reincarnation '' . 
thrust passage 
context liken one time incarnation 
sacrifice christ mankind individual 
experience human death . 
`` '' 
repeat emphasize , highlight singularity 
christ 's deed . 
one thing certain 
refute claim christ incarnate 
. 
comparison human experience - die 
, judgement note : `` judgement '' , 
`` judgement '' . 
word judgement `` '' . 
hebrew 9:27 one passage often quote defense 
doctrine bible deny reincarnation . 

point , would emphasize passage 
arguably speak , invariably 
talk something ele , apparent denial 
reincarnation either infer , , case 
hebrew , take literally deposit imply context , 
namely doctrine destiny human 
death . 
consider seriously bible essentially 
silent fate individual human death 
last day . 
take passage could possibly 
interpret mean single earth life , arguable . 

passage point , arguably , - 
tion . 
matthew 11:14 john . 
continue debate individual scrap scripture 
might , indeed discuss . 
want introduce discussion approach 
idea repeat earth live , unlike hindu , buddhist 
`` new age '' teaching , take full cognizance divinity , singular 
incarnation , death , burial , resurrection , second come christ 
savior mankind ; accountability individual 
deed reality fall sin consequence ; 
redemption man sin christ ; resurrection 
body , last judgement . 
take larger sense , many serious question take entirely 
different perspective . 
e.g. destiny die 
sin christ come . 
relationship faith grace 
work , meaning `` deathbed conversion '' , meaning 
sacrament , many thing . 
propose answer 
question simple doctrine convenience , 
discussion take different dimension , opinion 
one truly worthy man , earth , creator 
redeemer . 
many deep question continue deep , 
meaning second death , whole christian 
doctrine would apply larger perspective human existence . 
deeply believe thing bible 
speak thing concern . 
christ 
also indicate thing would come know 
future , include thing disciple therefore 
could bear yet . 
idea human capacity growth 
knowledge , individual one lifetime , whole 
humanity , also take great meaning realize growth 
spirit long term process . 
bible mean codify 
spiritual knowledge one place forever , proclaim gospel 
incarnation redeeming deed christ - take gospel 
greater context , genesis revelation . 
, salvation healing become , 
end man 's sojourn beginning . 
last judgement 
new heaven earth follow become .
