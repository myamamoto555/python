`` fiery apocalypse '' ... thought . 
personally , fire set either side , wonder 
timing . 
koresh & co. set fire , wait six hour 
start ; anything `` new '' 
happen around point ? 
similarly , fbi go 
torch place fake , course , wait long , would 
`` reasonable '' believe bd 's would set fire early 
assault begin ? 
plausible accidental start 
fire tank . 
among thing , say 
listen radio fire start reporter 
watch distance , course say look like least 
one tank penetrate farther building previously . 
specifically , say one tank apparently halfway half 
tank 's building previously 
penetrate foot . 
reserve judgement ,
