ok !

different language serbs croats ? 
bosnia , `` muslim '' merely religious category , ethnic 
one well . 
actually , two contradictory argument 
make people subject : 
1 serbian croatian nationality , bosnian muslims 
simply croats serbs islamic faith . 
2 bosnian muslims separate nationality since feel 
croats serbs . 
1968 , argument 2 accept former yugoslavia valid , 
1 soundly reject . 
reason pragmatic : even 
bosnian muslims croats serbs convert islam 
turkish rule century ago , none present generation 
clue ancestor 's actual nationality . 
fact , although 
bosnian muslims feel draw croatian serbian national 
allegiance , feel separate cultural 
historic identity . 
, argument like `` yes , ancestor 
croat serb '' carry little weight . 
regardless 
ancestor might , long bosnian muslims feel 
separate national group , end debate . 
outsider say simply relevant . 
> way western press use word ` muslim ' bosnian debacle 
> keep wonder meaning know childhood 
> change dictionary . 
question . 
flame intend ! 
case former yugoslavia , date 1971 , `` muslim nationality '' 
appear census category first time . 
result 
sequence decision past decade , recognize 
`` bosniaks '' ethnic group 1961 february 1968 resolution 
declare muslims separate nation , formal endorsement 
january 1969 , eventually 1971 inclusion 
`` muslim nationality '' choice census form . 
comparison , 1948 census three national category 
available muslims bosnia-herzegovina : 
: 
: 
muslims , ethnically undeclared : 
clearly demonstrate muslims feel 
nationality . 
tiny minority feel able choose serb croat 
nationality . 
census result show bosnian muslims 
consistently opt third category : 1948 choose `` undeclared '' , 
1953 choose `` yugoslavs '' , 1961 `` yugoslavs '' `` bosniak 
ethnic group '' , 1971 , 1981 1991 choose `` muslim nationality '' . 
perhaps term `` bosnian muslim nationality '' confusing 
rest world . 
, present context , talk 
muslims nationality ; religous group within 
separate national identity . 
reason mostly historical 
cultural . 
religion play smaller role , part culture general , 
area simply know religious fanaticism . 
political 
fanaticism , yes ; religious fanaticism , . 
group security survival 
dominate people 's thinking ; fine point theology . 
fact , 
bosnia-herzegovina well know religious tolerance peacetime 
know terrible carnage wartime . 
sincerely ,
