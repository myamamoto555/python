try ship x server support 
visual . 
main problem encounter : 
1 client write logic like following : 
! 
1 
assume default depth 
client need deep visual root window 
run correctly . 
2 client even bother much , 
outright assume dynamic visual class , 
dynamic . 
work cmap 
associate static visual class , 
many client bother check , start 
throw call . 
though clearly client error , case many 
client easier expose 
default root window visual , ever would client 
writer change client right thing .
