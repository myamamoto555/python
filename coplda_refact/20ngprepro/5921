oh yeah , israel really ready `` expand border '' holiest day 
year yom kippur arabs attack 1973 . 
oh wait , 
choose omit war ... perhaps 100 % support exact 
opposite point try make ? 
think 
war hit israel hardest . 
also , 1967 
egypt , israel kick un force . 
1948 arabs 
refuse accept existance israel based border set 
united nations . 
1956 , egypt close red sea israeli 
shipping , clear antagonistic act . 
1982 attack response 
year constant shell terrorist organization golan 
heights . 
child murder time terrorist israel 
finally retaliate . 
nowhere see war israel start 
border could expand .
