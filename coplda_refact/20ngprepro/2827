| nick look interesting , need someone point 
| documentation . 
method likely give better result server - 
| resident ? 
would also interested look code 
| mention ... 
easy answer question : depend whether display 
device hold off-screen memory , , efficiently 
server manage resource deal limited off-screen 
memory bane server implementor 's existence ! 
. 
work graphic device off-screen memory 
main display copy rate eclipse main memory display copy 
rate , main memory display faster 
off-screen display require write framebuffer rather 
read f.b. follow write 
server use cfb code something like render 
cpu main memory , rate get 
likely equal maybe tad slower , depend os 's implementation 
share memory window , also 
copy cpu main memory graphic device . 
one image large , end 
grow size server process hold . 
one disadvantage , sample implementation , 
provision elegantly clean share memory segment 
client die sudden , violent death e.g. , `` kill '' . 

mindful clutter system zombie share memory segment .
