use on-chip capacitor reduce noise small 
systolic array chip load clock line . 
design cmo , use scalable design rule . 
thought bypass capacitor : 
1 help much simultaneous output switching -- 
still large inductance bypass capacitor 
load capacitor signal line ground 
return , still get ground power line bounce . 
2 help lot on-chip load , high load 
clock line . 
3 transient try suppress really high 
frequency , forget large area 
capacitor , since rc time constant large . 
make , metal , poly , diff sandwich , 
put lot hole poly layer , allow frequent 
contact . 
forget exactly wide poly 
line . 
design , would probably 
omit diff altogether , use solid poly sheet instead , 
use m2 , m1 , poly substrate , high 
resistance ignore speed . 
4 probably better try tune circuit run 
slightly slower edge lower voltage swing especially 
output signalling , spend chip area capacitor . 
spare space die since circuit big 
tiny chip , next size twice big 
need .
