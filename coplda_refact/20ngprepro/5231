would give baserunning much value . 
effect clear , effect well . 

olerud hit double , runner first score ; alomar leg 
extra base onto hit gap , runner first may need hold 
third . 
thus olerud 's double advancement value 
alomar 's . 
course , alomar likely score hit 
double . 
another reason give much extra value baserunning 
run create formula work fast slow team . 

team 1950 's run much , team certainly faster player 
. 
still , current run create formula work well 
1950 's team . 
bill james give 1955-1958 senator example . 
use harmon 
killebrew regularly pinch runner , 1957 , steal 13 basis 
38 time catch steal . 
yet score slightly run 
predict runs create .
