detect double standard ? 
exactly american constitution say `` right 
association '' ? 
homosexual , whether clayton like , much member 
society . 
right participate 
equal opportunity pursue goal . 
no-one say clayton force associate 
private life one suspect gay question would 
object also 8 - , proclaim general right associate 
public sphere include housing , hire , etc , 
give right priority rights 
equal access opportunity . 
historically , people associate publically disliked group 
little , however cut group normal 
commerce severe impact life . 
clayton , exactly `` right '' 
public sphere take priority homosexual 's rights equal opportunity ?
