think proposal would work get extra one , maybe two extra 
bit color resolution . 
however , display 
zero full intensity primary , think would get great 
equivalent 24-bit photograph .

year ago friend take 256 photo 
1 bit mac plus screen use method . 
display 256 level 
synchronize display take 10 seconds . 

experiment different aperture setting screen 
brightness find range work well , give respectable 
contrast . 
quality image pretty good . 

visible contrast band . 
minimize exposure time display program build 255 
different 1 bit frame . 
first contain dot pixel 
value 255 , second pixel value 254 , 
etc. . 
frame store use sparse datum structure 
fast ` ' onto screen sequence . 
create 
frame sometimes take 5-10 minute old mac , camera 
shutter close time anyway . 
yes , write 
directly screen memory . 
mea culpa . 
biggest problem small image display 
top leave corner screen instead center . 
take 
extra week film develop print , 
processor take trouble manually move image 
center print . 
would guess ? 
regard ,
