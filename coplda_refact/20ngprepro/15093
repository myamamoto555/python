vmax racing horror story delete 
portland international raceway 2-for-2 ` e . 

- handle ? 
. 
actually , wera racer , william lumsden , consider run vmax 
superstock . 
take talladega gpr practice day , 
_ really _ annoy 600 rider -- usually get catch behind 
sideways vmax corner , pass go , would 
blow straight usually wobble . 
needless say , since 
2 seconds faster 1977 , decide vmax . 
bad .
