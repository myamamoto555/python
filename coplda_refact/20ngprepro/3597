andy byler 
issue get mighty subtle . 
see people say different 
thing often hard tell whether really mean seriously 
different thing , whether use different terminology . 

think question problem 
nestorius , would agree say christ human form 
without real human nature heretical . 
would like 
bit wary copts , armenians , etc. . 
recent discussion 
suggest monophysite position may far 
orthodoxy many think . 
nestorius extreme 
representative one two major school thought . 

moderate representative regard orthodox , e.g. theodore 
mopsuestia . 
impression modern monophysite group 
inherit entire tradition , nestorius ' version , 
may sufficient balanced position regard 
orthodox .
