: one argue objective value moral sense one must 
: first start demonstrate morality objective . 
consider 
: meaning word `` objective '' doubt ever happen . 
: , back original question : 
: objective morality ... ? 
may unfortunate choice word , almost self-contradictory . 
objective sense use mean something immutable 
absolute morality describe behavior group 
people . 
first term inclusive , second specific . 

concept supposedly describe may mean however . 
god describe christian instance , 
existence apart independent humankind ; 
existence outside frame reference reality . 

declare thing , - necessarily - since 
define omnipotent , claim believe , 
least omnipotent relative . 
god intrinsically 
self-defined reality whatever say - 
objective sense . 
god determine standard conduct , standard objective . 
human hold accountable conformance 
standard permit ignore , substitute relative 
morality mode conduct , give term morality nebulous , 
meaningless sense argue pretend 
misunderstand . 
standard objective conduct require 
meet standard therefore objectively determine . 
convenient pretend term morality 
infinitely malleable , mean objective standard 
exist . 
morality come mean little cultural 
norm , preferred conduct `` decent '' people , make seem 
subjective , derive absolute , objective , standard . 
ironically , objective standard perfect accord true 
nature accord christianity least , yet condemn 
contrary human nre , oppressive severe . 
may due 
bill 
much amoral inclination standard , like
