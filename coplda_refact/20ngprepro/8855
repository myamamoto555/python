good hear reasonable christian . 
christian `` scientist '' would take note . 
australia strong movement , bunch christian 
scientist believe every single event bible exactly 
true , rational explanation justified 
use law physics . 
example , chap 
try prove age universe 6000 year old , 
error conventional calculation result fact speed 
light rapidly decay year ,

> modern day koresh actually say .

intend become manifesto billion people .

million people `` die lie '' . 
point difficult 
substantiate since well define great many religious argument 
work way , consider many aztec warrior sacrifice 
god belief act would bring victory 
spanish invader . 
list endless . 
aztecs lose , btw . 
> call fool , believe heal people . 
perfectly reasonable , grounds anyone 
become christian . 
point , add weight 
claim jesus `` real thing '' . 
> lunatic . 
would entire nation draw 
> someone crazy . 
doubtful , fact . 
example 
> anyone draw david koresh obviously fool , logical people see 
> right away . 
ever see documentary rise nazi germany ? 

point , tony mention ? 
one could hardly call werner heisenberg 
many colleague fool , illogical man , support hitler base 
presume upon emotional issue rather rational agreement 
principle . 
obviously argument invalid tony think hitler 
sane ...

hmmm ... think argument warrant use `` therefore ... ''

unfortunately alot religious discussion 
people result - quote bible . 
reasonable way think 
people look bible treat story sort 
metaphorical representation message author try 
present . 
someone try interpret part bible literally , 
end sort shit . 
tony 's argument would perfectly reasonable people believe 
event describe bible take place , convince someone , 
think bible total fiction , jesus real quote 
book totally pointless . 
example , mathematics say `` 
equal b equal b '' . 
> think people understand christian . 
would possibly explain many people kill 
religious war , hundred different version 
claim correct .

rather think

box everything time unit . 
work

god box 
> carry box create 
> . 
think post part would get flame 
. 
never really understand emotional sentiment 
stranger interest people . 
someone famous say two evil life , church , one 
rule fear living , fear dead . 
press 
could probably find exact quotation . 
cheers , 
charles .
