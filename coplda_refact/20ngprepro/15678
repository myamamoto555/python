think grant fuhr deserve credit ! 
true entire sabres team play well , 
still believe grant fuhr , series would 
tie 2-2 . 
virtually steal game 1 3 sabres . 
game , fuhr stand head give sabres 
chance win . 
especially game 3 , fuhr make series 
huge stop third period score tie 2-2 . 
even game 2 sabres win 4-0 , score seem 
indicate sabres dominate . 
however , 
fuhr , sabres would 2-0 think 
2nd period bruins would open 
game thereby allow mogilny score third goal 
breakaway salt away game . 

doubt mind fuhr critical factor 
victory . 
opinion , neely , oates juneau play well 
lafontaine , mogilny hawerchuk . 
sabres get 
extraordinary effort hannan , sweeney , wood , khmylev 
compare bruins checkers . 
however , bruins defense 
, imo , play better sabres defense sabres ken sutton 
play regular shift afterall ; - 
difference series fuhr , outplay andy moog . 
gary 
go sabres !
