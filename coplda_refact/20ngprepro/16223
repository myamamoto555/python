dandridge cole isaac asimov collaborate book title , 
`` habitable planet man '' think 1964 . 
available 
good library , inter-library loan . 
answer question ask speculatively , course , along 
many need consider habitability study : 
length day temperature variation , agricultural 
concern , partial pressure certain unexpected gas ever hear 
xenon narcosis ? 
neither , density particulate atm , 
composition ever hear silicosis ? 
much fun , etc. . 
climate global phenomenon probably need concern , 
axial tilt ought . 
play large part determine 
severity seasonal difference , lesser still significant 
part determine speed prevail wind .
