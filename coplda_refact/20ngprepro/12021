rob debate wood stove . 
original post claim pump napalm 
build hope wood stove inside would ignite . 

would wood stove light first place ? 
would light 
heating purpose weather texas . 
everyone claim 
cooking . 
stop think . 
cs gas pump 
building presume everyone wear gas mask either 
buy type makeshift type go 6 hour . 
know ever around cs , . 
expose cs 
gas part army training , know without mask 
uncomfortable make eye water , nose run , make sick 
stomach . 
mask difficult drink water much less 
eat . 
question `` cooking food ? '' 
buy lantern could knock cause fire . 
stove use cooking unless even 
crazy claim .
