comet 
| may remain orbit around jupiter long enough allow galileo 
| make closeup observation . 
orbital trajectory comet 
| still determine . 

positional uncertainty ? 
assume know 
galileo within meter . 
without 
hga , pretty good idea , look 
imaging ? 
hga work , could slew around 
near real time less speed light delay . 

imaging ???? 
someone get lucky guess 
find first image ? 
also , imagine mostly visual image . 

affect imaging mission . 
lga , real 
tight allocation bandwidth . 
may premature hope answer , 
think would throw floor .
