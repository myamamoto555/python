necessarily -- could release detail algorithm 
without release `` system key '' call sk hellman . 
would 
make people happy , sort verification procedure 
key exchange , `` official '' chip would work 
`` official '' chip . 
word , secrecy sk make `` physically 
identical clone version '' impossible ; secrecy algorithm 
necessary . 
course , reveal algorithm open attack sk -- 
since unit share key , compromise may big deal . 
personally , would feel comfortable know one `` secret '' 
80-bit number hold many place guarantee security . 
course , compromise sk necessarily mean system 
compromise , impossible tell whether true 
secret algorithm . 
incidentally , keep `` secret algorithm '' use secret 
sk main key , uk marginally important . 

court order uk may even necessary wiretap .
