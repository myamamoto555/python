primarily convertible . 
convertible look 
feature detail . 
alpine actually make better radar unit want 
get one . 
zone shut independently 
one side car pedestrian traffic something else 
would trigger alarm , shut zone , rather , pull tighter . 
see real benefit unless convertible 
leave top . 
avoid voice alarm add radar package . 
talk 
people walk . 
see one install lotus esprit . 
kid would 
taunt see close could get ` warn ' get back . 
owner finally disabled , defeat purpose mind .
