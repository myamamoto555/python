buy new portable cd player office , notice 
proudly proclaim `` 8 time oversampling '' box . 
think 
understand oversampling rate discrete `` sample '' 
exceed highest frequency component interest factor , 
understand `` 8 time '' business ... seem 
buy first cd player really 10 year ago ?! 
, spec 
say `` 4 time '' ... could someone please tell whether get 
senile ? 
, good player take 
sample higher rate ?

quite correct understanding . 
filter 
interpolation , would distort frequency content signal 
listen . 
generally , player run sample thru 
filter network . 
ecg waveform person 's 
heart , effect rather spooky . 
actually reconstruct peak 
correctly , ! 
fill gap 
properly compute value , real sample take 
point . 
use cpu math . 
take decent 
unreasonable amount cpu time . 
keep thing 
realtime write efficient code . 
case care , filter method use fir finite impulse response 
filter . 
would guess cd maker use kind method . 
anybody 
know real answer ? 
would say use tap delay line 
weighting accomplish filter . 
strike 
cost effective method volume production run .

actually , think reason say 
. 
would guess cheaper 
filter signal . 
use sloppier component 
give filter roll-off sharp . 
bad 
charge something think actually less costly build . 
seriously doubt filter cost better . 

build price spec , spec say `` cheap possible ! ''
