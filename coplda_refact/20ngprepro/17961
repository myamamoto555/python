design ramp shutoff , current limit even 
cutoff ... sound like want `` '' current limit . 
lead correct pull bias series regulator base 
drive . 
order get brick - wall , need enough voltage gain 
current sensor . 
normally darlington current sense 
resistor adequate , infinite gain . 
. 
use op amp sense 
current stable voltage reference use driver 
turn base bias transistor . 
phase compensation 
may necessary closed loop control system 
180 degree phase shift circuit unity gain ok ??
