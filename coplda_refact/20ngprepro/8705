follow giants closely off-season -- newspaper , 
, etc -- first close personal last night 
stick . 
watch giants hitter struggle last year , barry 's swing 
impressive -- quick swing seem effortless , even 
compare clark particularly clark late . 
interesting see bond hit maddux well . 
sure 
barry revenge braves stroke 
three pretty hit 1b , 2b , hr 5 's . 
giants team lot surprising thing year 
addition bond . 
good pitching hitter 
seem swing much better . 
clayton 's defense superb . 
mcgee seem like lead year . 
drive ball . 
& forth . 
hope continue ... think need continue well june 
people really sell real -- particularly pitching . 
, think fresh start really wipe 
lot negative last year real factor 
help significantly improve last year .
