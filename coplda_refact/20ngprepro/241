clearly depend type question ask many 
case fine . 
critical information neuron 
firing frequency maximum 100 action potential per 
seconds , amplitude signal detail 
signal shape . 
resolution 0.4 % get 8 bit 
sufficient . 
ac coupling problem either , since many case 
interested dc level . 
pre amplifier ac couple 
also . 
critical point lowest frequency pass . 

cutoff point high , action potential slightly 
distorted . 
even normally matter since 
occurrence spike important . 
however , want know exactly expect start 
battle toolbox get go . 
yet clue 
start look technical specification .
