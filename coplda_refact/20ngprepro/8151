`` assume '' ? 
also : come , brad . 
go get anywhere 
discussion , help bring element never 
address , comment way . 
make comment 
`` right '' `` wrong '' , civilian use cover 
, place `` '' israelis guerilla , 
injure party continue fight . 
purpose army 's use military uniform 
set member apart civilian 
civilian think side 
`` combatant '' . 
, think `` meaning behind '' , 
intention effect `` army '' purposely 
uniform go way look 
like civilian ' ? 
judge benefit 
receive `` cover '' important harm 
come civilian . 

comment israeli experience say 
guerilla responsibility put civilian 
`` middle '' fight . 
put uniform live apart 
civilian barracks , etc. , guerilla would significantly lower 
risk civilian . 
guerilla put 
greater risk ? 
absolutely , ask `` set 
apart wear uniform ready-made 
cover civilian ? 
make sense point 
view , cover use , guerilla accept 
responsibility subsequent harm civilian .

make sense shell

least show reckless disregard israeli

agree . 
always think israel 's bombing 
bombing policy stupid , thoughtless , inhumane 
ineffective . 
, reason israel passive wait 
attacker choose act ; every reason believe 
`` take fight enemy '' stop attack . 
say previously , israel spend several decade `` sit passively '' 
side border act stop attack 
attacker enter israeli territory . 
work well . 
`` host '' arab state try stop attack 
side border israel number attack 
considerably higher , physical psychological impact 
civilian catch path .

another `` selectively apply '' statement . 
reason drawn-out impasse israelis 
neither side willing accept word . 

criterion everyone stay away negotiation . 
precisely palestinians recent proposal 
`` interim '' period negotiation lead full autonomy 
demand condition essentially define `` autonomy '' already . 

trust israel `` follow '' entire process allow 
palestinians reach full autonomy . 
understand accept viewpoint palestinians ? 
, israel 's view 
different ? 
trust ' word ? 
since , reluctant give `` tangible asset 
land , control area exchange `` word '' . 
reason , 
also concern sort `` guarantee '' 
arabs follow part agreement reach . 
> 
> see statement make way ? 
> lebanon interested peace accept word 
> israel attack cause war disarm 
> hizbollah remove cause continued occupancy . 
absolutely , ask first 
israelis `` word '' relation agreement ? 
, 
demand first land . 
issue land , one party 
finally get hold `` land '' , `` party '' 
totally irrelevent . 
possession land , 
word absolutely power ; whether israel choose 
keep word get land back .

hezbollah remain independent militia . 
hezbollah

> sheikh , wife , young son . 
`` major armament '' allow people wage `` civil war '' 
remove , weapon need cross-border attack still 
remain extent . 
rocket attack still continue , `` commando '' 
raid require easily conceal weapon refined disregard 
human life . 
attack also continue .

bat guano . 
situation call exist 1970 attack 
commonplace . 
> furthermore , hezbollah subsequently disarm , would possible . 
way group effectively `` disarm '' unless state 
authoritarian syria 's . 
way lebanon take 
upon constantly patrol entire border israel , essentially 
mirroring israel 's border side . 
prove isreal 
commit protect israel attack lebanese territory .

syria stay thay may even dangerous israel .

say , ok ? 
, mean syria `` take '' 
lebanon ? 
think israel lebanon would like . 
> 
`` side '' need receive something `` tangible '' . 
arabs 
palestinians look `` land '' demand receive 
prior give anything israel . 
israel two problem : 1 
give real land expose changed geostrategic 
situation change help israel 's position , 2 
give land need receive something return 
compensate increase risk
