ezekiel 18 teach correct principle . 
however , assume father son 
equal knowledge prepare judgment . 
parent responsible teach child 
gospel life skill . 

fail make sufficient attempt teach 
child , parent would hold responsible 
-- child 's sin , 
teach properly . 
whenever lord install someone position 
authority either family church 
expect person teach charge . 
ezekiel -9 someone call care 
liken `` watchman unto house israel . '' 
`` thou dost speak warn wicked 
way , man shall die iniquity ; 
blood require thine hand . 
nevertheless , thou warn wicked way 
turn ; turn way , 
shall die iniquity ; thou hast 
deliver thy soul . '' 
even though d&c preface commandment 
`` parent child zion '' believe 
parent responsible teach child 
whatever good principle understand . 
however , ld parent accept greater responsbility 
could judge strictly .
