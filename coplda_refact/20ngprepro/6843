> hispanic magazine april 1993 couple interesting article 
> hispanic player include hispanic all-star team . 
> major point : 
npr 's morning edition air report morning 
american player mlb many 
problem face american player 
first enter league . 
however , although baseball 
adjust presence black player , many hispanic 
player still labor stereotype `` fireball , 
hot blooded , flashy '' . 
report also emphasise despite 
ranting word jessie jackson baseball 
discrimination black player upper echelon , 
baseball actually much better black player 
hispanic player . 
another interesting point language barrier problem . 

reporter elaborate interview ruben sierra 
give spanish spanish speaking newspaper reporter 
fact maybe 2 major baseball writer 
speak spanish , despite fact spanish one 
easiest language learn , easy author cormac 
mccarthy learn spanish age 50 order research 
book , _ pretty horse _ . 
yet , mlb organization 
employ spanish speak personel , one exception 
oakland 's . 
another point : 
nearly 90 % latin american player african blood . 
yet , report would never really feel black 
play ball us . 
ironically enough , early presence latin american 
baseball player major leagues support idea 
baseball integrate arrival jackie robinson , 
many `` light black '' `` brown '' , latin americans 
incorporate baseball .
