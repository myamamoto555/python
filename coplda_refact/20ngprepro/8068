find argument strange , though unfamiliar . 
analogy someone use back perhaps illustrate . 
say , example , people live volcanic island , group 
geologist determine volcano imminent . 
warn people 
island danger , leave . 
group people 
island give task warn danger . 
believe danger real , may . 
mean first group necessarily arrogant warn 
danger ? 
mean say belief 
correct , false ? 
might indeed react opposition arrogance , behave 
arrogant manner , personal . 

necessarily mean arrogant .
