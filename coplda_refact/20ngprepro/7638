actually , `` roughly ... urban economy '' , 
extremely different ethnic composition .

however , account economic ethnic difference , 
difference disappear completely : seattle 's minority 
poor , vancouver 's middle upper class . 
rate whites city find , 
rate poor , seattle minority almost three 
time great well-to-do minority vancouver .

gross distortion : `` self-defense '' mean kill 
attacker . 
21 case civilian kill 
attacker self-defence . 
case represent less 
0.5 % crime prevent armed self-defence ; every 
case cite , 200 case self-defence 
crime prevent attacker kill . 
0.5 % , way , conservative possible figure , 
base national crime survey 's estimate 80,000 
crime prevent armed self-defence year . 

study subject put figure 500,000 600,000 . 
figure would imply less 0.08 % sucessful self-defence 
involve kill attacker . 
, correctly , 4000 possibly many 25,000 
case civilian act self-defence , 21 result 
death attacker . 
significant factor , 
comparison 592 homicide . 
memory serve , homicide 
make approximately 1 % violent crime study 
consider , fair comparison would 40 - 250 homicide 
prevent 592 homicide . 
clearly , study 
close accurate , since ignore case self-defence .
