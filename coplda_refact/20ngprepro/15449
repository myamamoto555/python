8 mb simm composite simm , although many ? 
16 mb 
simm . 
simm allow two memory bank per simm , thus permit 
use 4 mb dram device one use 4 mb simm use 
two 4 mb bank one simm . 
imagine would cheaper 
build 8 mb simm use 1 mb dram 4 mb part reach 
exceed bit bit price parity 1 mb part time ago . 
probably possible build 8 mb simm use 4 mb part - 
could cause problem . 
sure would want 
, though , 8 mb simm would cheaper build 
composite one .
