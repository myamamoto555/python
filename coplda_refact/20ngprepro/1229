great , however leave one detail , always 
see nuclear plant , always fossil fuel plant . 

nuclear plant prefer run water close cycle , whereas 
fossil fuel plant case get away dump hot 
water . 
recall water hot thermodynamically many 
fossil fuel plant , course less danger radioactive 
contamination .
