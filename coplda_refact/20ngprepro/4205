isa bus ?

talk isa bus , 1 dma channel 
active one time , presumably transfer datum single device . 
even though least 7 device scsi bus , explain 
7 device dma transfer single scsi card 
bus time . 
also , still try track copy ibm 's reference book , 
pc technical manual page 2-93 : 
`` fdd adapter buffer bus use system board 
direct memory access dma record datum transfer . '' 
expect see something similar hdd adapter . 
lowly low-density original pc fdd card use dma 
hdd controller 
make real sense .
