henry spencer write :

question whether 
: anyone go large-scale satellite servicing near 
: future , point justify development thing . 
mighty fine idea . 
since ask `` , '' ` ll 
respond . 
put aside application space dock , 
factor consider pressurized volume . 
temperature control 
difficult space , inflatable hangar 
incorporate thermal insulation maybe double-walled inflatable . 
micrometeoroid protection radiation protection also require . 
think clear plastic bubble ; likely 
look like big white ball make kind multi-layer 
fabric space suit make today . 
almost manned space vessel skylab , mir , salyut use 
pressurization increase structural rigidity , even though 
metal skin , still kind qualify inflatable . 
inflation process would carefully control . 

space environment reduce ductility expose material due 
temperature extreme , oxygen impingement , radiation 
effect material , `` fabric '' may retain flexibility 
long . 
may matter . 
even inflation , pressure 
change hangar may cause flex fabric , could 
lead hole tear ductility decrease . 
technical difficulty llnl proposal 
inflatable space station deal vary degree 
success .
