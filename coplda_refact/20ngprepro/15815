bleep ! 
bruins lose o.t. stand ! 
aside frustrated ravings , must give buffalo credit : make good 
score opportunity , play great defense . 
boston 
player seem get control puck anywhere near buffalo net 
except rare occasion . 
buffalo defense also excellent 
job clearing away rebound . 
fuhr play great big save need 
also get plenty help . 
boston play rather well better would indicate 
series score 3-0 lack extra drive earlier part 
game . 
result , boston keep leave ice end 1st period 
2 goal . 
must stop boston hope win single 
game outlook bruin 's advancement second round quite 
bleak . 
, bruins need score first . 
, 
excellent chance win , since outplay sabres 
2nd 3rd period . 
scary thing 'll go grad school buffalo next year . 
'll never cheer sabres ... convert ... ^ :
