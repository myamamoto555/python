would help mention chapter verse sirach 
james . 
job 5:13 `` taketh wise craftiness '' seem 
quote 1 corinthians 3:19 . 
james 5:11 `` hear patience job '' , 
quote , imply james listener familiar 
story man name job exhibit exemplary patience . 

possible story know find hebrew 
bible , rather another similar related story . 
one 
problem direct quote . 
, matthew 1:5 `` boaz beget obed ruth '' tell matthew 
know story woman name ruth marry man call boaz 
become ancestor david . 
since ruth mention 
ot outside book ruth , seem likely matthew 
familiar book respect , think ruth important 
enough one woman mention genealogy . 
reference like prove nt writer consider 
ot source inspire inerrant canonical . 
neither direct 
quote .
