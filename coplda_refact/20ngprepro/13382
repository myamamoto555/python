actually d&c -28 parent hold accountable 
sin . 
specifically accountable failure 
teach child properly . 
fail teach child 
steal wrong responsible theft 
later indulge behavior . 
similar instruction ezekiel give 
eze 3:18 . 
ezekiel fail duty warn wicked , 
would wicked die sin lord would hold 
ezekiel responsible ! 
similarly parent responsible teach 
child right wrong . 
suspect christian 
jews etc. would agree parent responsibility .
