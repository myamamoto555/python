sound like cool program . 
tis ' gleam eye point . 
yet choose tracking 
method . 
initial requirement design system locate dancer 
one eight zone across stage . 
experiment 
pyroelectric detector find difficult align get definite 
zone transition . 
dancer stand still alot , ir signature go 
away . 
good thing signal proportional 
size warm body body part , velocity say body . 
could useful detect intensity dance gesture . 
dancer also really hate wear little box battery strap 
body , really need emit kind signal track . 
current toy work program call mandala 
amiga , use live ! 
video digitizer . 
work video camera 
train stage . 
set threshold zone within field 
view , object brighter threshold trigger event . 
event 
midi object sequence , amiga sound graphic object . 

fun play , arcane , digitizer noisy . 
still , appealing , dancer wear appliance , 
ot zone , , speak midi , use control light , 
build electronics . 
lighting 
video brightness contrast adjustment . 
yet anything 
particularly useful artistic , hope ...
