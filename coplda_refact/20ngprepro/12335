since bio support interface hard disk xt , 
support must come bio extension rom hard disk 
controller . 
usually controller low level format 
program common jump address ... type g :5 
debug see small table drive geometry `` know '' . 
sometimes selectable use jumper card , sometimes 
enter manually llf menu . 
fail , must use 
third-party hd prep program like , disk manager , like . 
ide drive come format already , since controller part 
drive mechanism , concern geometry irrelevant . 
plug 
go fdisk .
