think agree much . 
however paragraph seem repeat 
uncritically standard view `` progress '' 
`` rationality '' science . 
since address issue 
newsgroup distant past , go . 
wrong observation explicitly give 
impression may fact hold view common perhaps 
even `` correct '' approach scientist follow sit around 
flight fancy scheming basis jealousy 
petty hatred . 
least implicitly advance position 
science go `` forward '' clear mean give 
context occur generate completely non-rational 
even random way plethora hypothesis theory 
weed via `` critical function '' science . 
though critical 
function less subject non-rational force mystery . 
experimental design , hypothesis creation , theory construction 
subject jealousy petty hatred , must equally true 
application `` critical function '' concern replication . 
lead one alum feyerabend `` anything go '' view . 
true , generation part totally irrational . 
typically 
. 
anecdote concern instance hypothesis seem 
result way dream one 's political view simply 
generalize well actual history science .
