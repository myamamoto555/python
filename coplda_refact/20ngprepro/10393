ultimate statement equal rights something many 
forget `` care either man woman , 
care black white , care gay 
straight . '' 
say `` care color , 
race , gender sexual preference '' , truly 
right track . 
keep shove difference face expect get along ? 
get real ! 
long try make care black , female , 
whatever , go continue balk . 
natural human behavior . 
moment employer search employee , bank look lend 
money , administration look appointee 
say `` care color , race , gender , sexual preference ; 
instead treat human , '' crap like last year 's 
riot continue happen . 
> 1 . 
hey man , rule !! 
barf . 
mean economic theorist say thing like `` sake 
convenience mathematical modeling first assume 
wealth creation '' get crack implement phd thesis 
real life ? 
go back textbook macroeconomic theory . 
look first chapter 
book , introduce field macroeconomic theory . 
right 
chapter 1 , section 1 , statement like following : 
`` difficult predict model wealth creation , 
especially economy wealth creation inherently 
province individual create new invention 
discover new idea , assume rest 
book wealth creation . 
`` assume lack creation real world , 
however mathematical modeling inherently 
unpredictable subject impossible . 
even though assume 
wealth creation , believe mathematical 
economic modeling assumption reasonably valid 
allow make prediction test . '' 
guy run store clinton company 
assume wealth creation exist . 
borrow 
idea hitchhiker 's guide advance think simple 
thing . 
, would rather engineer year experience 
build bridge design next bridge , rather theoretical 
physicist freshly mint phd experience job .
