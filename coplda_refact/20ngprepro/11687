point ? 
course . 
something get corrupt app need 
reinstall , worst thing want software tell `` 
software already register law 
install machine . '' 
something similar ; access windows 
require click `` ok '' go away . 
pretty 
non-intrusive , get point across .

great idea . 
like key system shareware
