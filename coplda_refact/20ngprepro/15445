_ _ know 
primary instrument development all-sky map 
long-term source . 
give fact , spacecraft attitude knowledge 
approx . 
2 arcmin , might able figure well 
determine location rotational gamma ray burster knowledge 
all-sky map 's accuracy . 
pr material three instrument 
give accuracy order `` fraction degree '' , 
help . 
speak gro , probably happy see prep 
orbit adjust appear go well . 
branch guy help
