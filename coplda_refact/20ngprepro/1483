idea suggest around discussion possible 
near-term commercial space activity . 
one folk involve 
discussion , 
spacecraft engineer name preston carter , pass suggestion 
type , mike lawson apparently go ahead 
. 
preston llnl , work space marketing

nasa would provide contractual launch service . 
however , 
since nasa base charge seriously flawed cost estimate 
wn 26 mar 93 taxpayer would bear expense . 
actually , sound unlikely . 
know launch vehicle 
would , would expect go commercial launcher -- 
certainly shuttle -- fraction cost pay nasa 
, e.g. , launch support would probably 
cover nasa 's incremental cost pretty well . 

may look like environmental vandalism , mike lawson , ceo 
space marketing , tell yesterday real purpose 
project help environment ! 
platform carry ozone 
monitor explain -- advertising help defray cost .

, note , llnl involve lightweight sensor design , per 
clementine related program . 
sure folk around would like 
see demonstration modern inflatable structure , , 
u.s. echo satellite long ago , advertising structure 
would much closer inflatable space station echo 
parade balloon , matter .

think revolting hideous attempt vandalize 
night sky ? 
even april 1 anymore . 
happen personally dislike idea , mostly get 
background astronomy , hardly vandalism -- would short-lived 
intrusion night sky , permanent damage actually hurt 
small subset astronomer . 
hand , would certainly 
draw attention space .
