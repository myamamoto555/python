would desparately prefer rehash argument 
go ad infinitum last time . 
especially true 
. 
matter , create , since 
traffic appear many different group right . 
go focus technical aspect plan , hence 
followup . 
frankly , absolutist , 
feeling may turn issue . 
example -- 
80-bit key , simply splitting two 40-bit piece much less 
acceptable scheme , mean one 
repository , shall say , overly pliable , would-be eavesdropper 
would need recover 40 bit key . 
need point 
newsgroup pretty easy exhaustive search . 
slightly complex scheme -- key random number , 
complement -- would produce two 80-bit , 
neither useful alone . 
variant much resistant 
attack . 
clearly , one get even sophisticated , protect 
even . 
thought ... people note size complexity 
database necessary . 
id string phone emit could 
back door key , escrow repository ' 
public key . 
matter , could session 
key , back door . 
case , fbi would 
bring every intercept repository decrypt . 

would answer many objection along line `` 
make sure stop '' . 
even combine variant digital telephony back 
door -- switch tap , record 
time , phone number , etc , call . 
provide proof 
escrow agent tap compliance term 
warrant . 
suggest variation , . 
suppose clipper chip 100 
public key pair . 
would use ~ 10 time , would need 
key material . 
bad idea event . 
could 
use enforce time limit , rather , usage limit , warrant ; 
key repository agent would deliver would last 
long . 
suspect cryptographic algorithm secure . 
apart 
obvious -- push weak algorithm already get 
back door ? 
-- think government still genuinely concerned 
foreign espionage , especially aim commercial target . 

scheme let spook cake eat , . 
hear 
rumor , year , faction within nsa unhappy 
des good . 
could crack , 
much expensive easily would want . 
keep 
detail secret build implementation 
without back door . 
cryptographic protocol , though , another matter . 
see valid 
reason keep secret , -- hope show -- 
lot way thing quite bad .
