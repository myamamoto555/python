know mwm resource specify position use 
border window `` user '' window . 
maybe window manager 
similar option .

use remember window manager 
decoration window parent window . 
unfortunately , 
figure decoration width height window map 
way .

multiple 's get 
root work case , guarantee outside 
decoration window parent root window display .
