point , experiment would difficult . 
know 
enough physics situation calculation . 
fact three effect contribute lean bike 
begin turn . 
1 . 
gyro effect cause torque twist bike . 
2 . 
contact patch shift one side , cause bike fall . 
3 . 
contact patch accelerate side , cause 
torque twist bike . 
take average , average bike wheel , speed 5 , 
15 , 50 mph say calculate much twist bar would 
need produce say 20 degree lean say 2 seconds 
effect alone . 
guess slow speed 2 dominant , 
high speed 3 dominant , speed 1 contribute far 
bugger , relatively speak . 
way , similar problem : runner want 
run round corner get lean corner fast ? 
run 
group could start `` '' argument 
fall try work go round corner ?
