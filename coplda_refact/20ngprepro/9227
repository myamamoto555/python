, mention , must omnipotent . 

mean omnipotent ? 
mean `` omnipotent '' 
god able ? 
create 
self-contradictory definition omnipotence effectively 
useless . 
descriptive , omnipotence must mean `` all-powerful '' 
`` able '' . 
let illustrate analogy . 
suppose united states nuclear power earth . 
suppose 
us military could effectively counter 
nation group nation . 
us power go country 
time reason straighten thing leader 
us see fit . 
us would militarily `` omnipotent '' . 
suppose us hold 
interfere internal affair nation , current 
civil war former yugoslavian state . 
technically scenario us would power 
unilaterally go yugoslavia straighten mess . 

effectively us could intervene without violate policy 
non-interference . 
policy non-interference hold 
strongly enough , would never question would 
ever violate . 
effectively , us would limit 
could actually , although power `` whatever want '' . 
us would simply `` never want interfere '' idea would 
beyond consideration leader give inviolate 
non-interference policy . 
god effectively limit sense . 
powerful , 
use power way would violate essence 
, . 
hope help clear misunderstanding concern 
omnipotence .
