understand anger german audience . 
mean , 
finnish team play take advantage ridiculous 
penalty canadien ref call last period . 
germans get 
match penalty 10 minute misconduct practically nothing 
seconds german goalie get two minute `` delay game '' 
shot deflect go crowd . 
result 5:3 
skate advantage lead decide goal point , germans 
start come strong . 
also sick nationalism go german sport event . 
watch example tennis davis cup match player often 
able play minute , crowd obnoxious . 

admit kind nationalism strong even stronger 
country go us watch way present 
olympics television ; soccer crowd england ; finnish 
spectator nordic skiing event ... . 
mean make sick see 
nationalism world would rather see best 
win get .

admit sport german national site favorite team 
watch german soccer team bore watch , example .

crowd criticize . 
easy talk nearly 
german nazis nationalist ; kind propaganda 
ultraconservative people use germany . 
true 
great danger nationalism germany experience 
people least people know also regard 
big threat try demonstrate attitude . 

look people human try put drawer 
correspond nationality eg . 
russians communists ; 
americans capitalists ; german nazis , fin hang 
around bee drunk ferry ... .

seem different nazis talk .
