; serious motorcycle enthusiast without motorcycle , 
; put bluntly , suck . 
really would like advice would 
; good starter bike . 
know one thing however , need 
; make first bike good one , buy second time soon 
; question . 
specifically interested race bike , cbr 
; 600 f2 , gsx-r 750 . 
know may sound kind crazy 
; consider never bike , responsible , 
; fast learner , love . 
responsible love ? 
believe contradiction 
term . 
unless really brave read : `` reckless '' 500cc sport 
bike go way faster dare least first 
year ride . 
get really overkill , 
'll never even want use . 
follow bike 
buy repair ! 
cheaply , easy novice 
manage , plenty high performance : 
kawasaki 
honda `` interceptor '' 
suzuki 
time full throttle `` way 
sooner ready '' . 
something 
small 250 , would probably wish 
power pretty quickly unless rgv . 
, say 100 % certain kill 
immediately . 
plenty 
people start ride bike 
fine . 
say waste 
money , waste perfectly good plastic 
drop thing learn balance stop . 
'll never get throttle half open 
anyway , spend extra 2000 buck ?
