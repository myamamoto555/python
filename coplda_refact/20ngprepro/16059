yet another suggestion , one non-toxic although would handle 
like cleaner smell nice . 
chemical call 
, smell like lemon peel think lemon extract 
kind . 
might find hardware store , sell 
general-purpose solvent , best bet would bike store -- 
use fluid . 
work sticker glue , crayon , 
grease , oil , etc. . 
clear yellow bottle , use straight ; add 
water , change creamy consistency , good job .
