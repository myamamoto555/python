ah , rub . 
catch-22 boot . 
purpose 
contest , 'll probably compete 'n afford ride get

although lower price delivery system might doable , without 
demand doubtful anyone develop new system . 
course , 
low price system exist , might demand ... 
wonder might way structure contest encourage 
low cost payload delivery system .

depend soon new launch system come line . 

word , perhaps great deal worthwhile technology life support , 
navigation , etc. could develop prior low cost launch system . 
would want use expensive stuff forever , would hate see 
folk wait anything low cost mac , oop , mean launch 
system come line . 
guess would simplify say ` waste ' slippery concept . 

goal man lunar exploration next 5 year , perhaps 
` waste ' money . 
goal explore moon $ 500 
million , put exploration decade .
