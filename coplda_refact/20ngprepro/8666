canon scripture complete . 
mean god longer 
speak ? 
hear voice -- audibly though , 
clearly nonetheless . 
hear equivalent scripture ? 
. 

never hear contemporary prophet claim receive 
lord level scripture ; contrary , 
mature obey scriptures submit prophecy fellow 
believer judgement . 
reliable yardstick judge 
prophecy , certainly , scriptures . 
canon close 
-- god silent !
