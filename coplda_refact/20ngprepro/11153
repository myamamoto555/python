party back negotiating table , stake 
see indeed high future stability region 
perhaps world balance . 

israel continue refuse talk plo , labeling 
`` terrorist organization '' , window opportunity peace 
narrowing day . 
present talk allow deadlock 
without agreement long term lasting peace take 
account interest involve , chance peace indeed 
. 
plo , decision rejoin talk , stake 
reputation success talk . 
longer talk continue , 
start 1 half year ago , without tangible progress , 
plo support territory erode . 

land peace agreement reach , real soon , chance 
comprehensive peace treaty good . 
arabs , , 
recognize israel 's right exist inside secure border , isreal 
would turn recognize legitimate right palestinians self 
statehood . 
peace guarantee air tight 
treaty , region hope dwell economic social 
well population , rather prepare next war .

see right , position influence enjoy party favor 
negotiation process tenuous best . 
local `` election '' hebron 
plo expect win perhaps add bit flagging 
position `` legitimacy '' eye palestinians middle east 
disrupt hamas action overtly direct towards 
undermine west bank election . 
present ruling israeli 
labor coalition seem one rather thin political ice . 
palestinian 
delegation reduce 14 three protest israel `` lack 
seriousness '' talk refusal reverse deportation 
immediately . 
hopefully , however , party begin learn 
fact negotiation take place mean give 
anything away `` side '' favorite argument 
`` rejectionist '' . 
let 's hope inevitable disagreement 
major issue lead time agreement smaller 
`` interim '' `` phase '' , whatever term prefer step take .
