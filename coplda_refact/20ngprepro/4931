anybody know ? 
know , willing speculate anyone . 
several people suggest chip use public-key cryptography . 
another possibility use diffie-hellman key exchange , 
algorithm similar effect . 
dh allow end agree 
session key use symmetric cryptography something 
like des encryption . 
could `` back door '' key work system ? 
see 
possibility . 
one algorithm property 
session key deduce eavesdropper know back door 
key one possibly communicant . 
perhaps random number 
use dh seed back door key , . 
another possibility , suggest earlier , chip 
simply broadcast session key , encrypt chip 's 
internal secret key . 
system back door key secret key 
usable decrypt session key broadcast . 
actually chip 's 
secret key need public key usage , 
identical secret back-door key . 
proposal seem 
straightforward . 
still another possibility encryption algorithm use 
message `` dual key '' property , possession either 
two key use decrypt . 
one key would session key 
dh exchange , would back door key chip . 
worth note one proposal dorothy denning raise 
amazingly prescient on-line discussion last november 
december variation diffie-hellman third party would 
participate derive session key . 
quite fit 
know clipper work hint early 
knowledge clipper whose thinking somehow synchronize 
clipper designer may diffie-hellman mind .
