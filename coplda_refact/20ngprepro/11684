gerry palo write nothing christianity exclude 
theory succession life . 
write apostle paul , romans 9 , speak god 
choose jacob esau , add result 
anything either child , since bear 
yet . 
clearly , paul believe previous life , 
suppose reader believe . 

previous life , would make sense say , `` neither 
anything good bad yet , since yet bear . '' 
daniel cossack write ask whether fair god hate 
esau nothing bad ? 
reply hebrew standard usage speak hate 
mean simply put second place . 
example , 
consider say matthew 6:24 
+ man serve two master ; either hate one 
+ love , ... 
, obviously false man two master must hate one 
. 
obviously true must put one 
second place . 
dog always come either billy bobby 
call problem stand different place call 
simultaneously . 
give first priority . 
one must take 
second place . 
original example , second place mean 
jacob , esau , choose bear covenant blessing 
obligation , ancestor christ . 

eugene bigelow mention matthew 11:14 say john 
baptist : 
+ ye receive , elijah , come . 
take mean john figure , dress 
live like elijah , preach like elijah , fulfil 
prediction elijah would prepare way messiah . 

think elijah literal sense , , , 
neither john 1:21 .
