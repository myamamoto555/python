anyone know english language edition show 
verse even chapter number . 
always think 
edition would useful - although hard navigate around . 
scots nt show verse number , great 
read , particularly longer narrative passage , scots quite 
proper study edition - tend use get 
`` feel '' story , particularly gospel , use 
english edition look detail .
