opinion , limited tort option best thing casey ever 
. 
basically , limited tort mean give right sue 
pain suffering , unless one following condition meet : 
1 . 
medical bill result accident exceed $ x x 
number like 50,000 -- sure exact number 
2 . 
accident cause drunk driver mean , driver 
drunk 
3 . 
get good lawyer good case basically , appeal 
regain right sue , almost chance ever 
happen . 
give right sue pain suffering ; 
still sue medical cost , actual damages , etc. . 
agree limited 
tort , essentially give right asshole 
treat every accident entry litigation lottery . 

exchange , get substantial reduction rate . 
save 
$ . 
unfortunately , insurance company manage scare confuse 
people much 5 % pennsylvanians go limited tort . 
guess ok -- people opt , insurance 
company would push harder repeal .
