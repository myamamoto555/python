right ? 
would call `` predict 
> future '' . 
opinion sabo `` clearly better hitter '' 
samuel . 
datum 4-year period end last season . 
last season samuel batted .272 sabo hit .244 park adjust . 
season hit .200 , albeit sabo 
bat . 
agree career sabo better 
hitter samuel , also remind samuel 
better hitter certain situation sabo . 
predict sabo would choke , samuel would get 
hit . 
express opinion red manager 
even red fan would prefer samuel hit 
situation sabo . 
red manager time , assume 
would basis let sabo hit rather pinch - 
hit samuel . 
sure basis would utilize 
prior performance . 
would use particular 
aspect prior performance . 
correct ?

must say , aware publication . 
email 
information regard availability ? 
guess must apologize extensive 
study , say , supply side economics . 
mean insult . 
never believe right path . 
sorry 
contrary . 
also regret 
ability prove wrong . 
. 
believe 
season 's end chris sabo 's batting average clutch situation 
significantly lower batting average 
situation . 
prove happen , guess ` ll 
wait see .

worse clutch overall ? 
say !

second much stronger statement . 
fact ,

test rule past datum see

think agree rule

right ? 
`` second '' statement , mine .

sure , find somebody

well , actually , yet . 
finish look . 
, yet find someone hit significantly 
overall batting average clutch situation year 
1989 - 91 , reverse relationship 1992 .

unless reason expect consistency ,

give reason expect clutch ba

see detailed study 
> expect correlate . 
nope . 
sorry . 
interested reason expect 
chris sabo 's ability hit clutch correlate one 
year next , think could . 
interested 
reason expect joe carter 's ability hit clutch 
correlate one year next , think could . 
` re 
interested , think conclusion 
could valid could extrapolate entire 
baseball population . 
.

`` total idiot '' ? 
yes .

problem believe . 
accept work . 
believe try predict future clutch performance base 
prior clutch history meaningless . 
better coin toss . 
actually accept work . 
happen , also opinion certain situation , 
certain player , history superior inferior ability 
hit clutch might suggest reason history could 
valid project future player performance . 
player . 
chris sabo one player . 
> tell ? 
term fit ? 
open mind ? 
well , since defer statistical wisdom , think must 
open mind . 
pose question .
