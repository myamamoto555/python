dear friend , 
risc mean `` reduce instruction set computer '' . 
risc usually 
small instruction set reduce circuit complex increase 
clock rate high performance . 
read book 
computer architecture information risc .

theoretically suppose reduce ... longer . 
everyone 
argue risc v.s. cisc . 
personally , think cisc win . 
take look pentium ! 
like intel architecture either , 
another story ... 

bye !

first , remember intel cisc like

100 % sure , think transputer ? 
ya tie 
gazillion together get . 
newest 
kick anyone 's butt ... see used much though . 
anyway , respond , think pentium cisc better advanced 
risc e.g. , like alpha , etc. . 
pentium approximately 
`` performance '' 133mhz alpha - , performance 
weird everyone refer ? 
- hear - 
alpha still kick p5 's butt fp - , hear . 
computing world , sell lot chip like intel , 
make faster like intel , winner like intel , even though 
architecture 10 year ago like intel :0 . 
make `` cisc '' chip superscalar , , superfast 
idea behind `` risc '' ideology , get cisc chip . 

admit see advantage risc cisc ... 
latest technology generation behind , suck relatively 
speak . 
may sound like like intel , 'll say p5 
real kick butt pile si sio2 ... 
hope motorola really catch 68k line ... gon na 
start cry ...
