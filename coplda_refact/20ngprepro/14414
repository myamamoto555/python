kid stay home 1st grade , infection 
incidence much lower exposure lower . 
study suggest 
early exposure various infectious disease probably beneficial 
exposure adult carry much risk 
mortality mumps , measles . 
etc. .

datum

daycare always carry higher exposure risk home care .

exposure infectious organism build immunity . 
many virus 
mutate new strain require another immune response 
new antibody production . 
addition , antibody level tend decline 
time need keep antibody level high . 
chronic overstimulation immune response lead 
rare unlikely occur child . 
> -- take antibiotic regular basis negative long 
> term effect ? 
yes , chronic use antibiotic adverse effect good 
bacterium suppose present body . 
health effect 
depletion good bacterium hotly debate topic 
medical community physician seem discount health effect 
chronic antibiotic use view support . 
> -- one tell child susceptible illness 
> normal , one ? 
chronic infection adult child need work 
opinion . 
physician feel chronic infection child 
normal exposure lack prior immunity many 
infectious disease . 
share view 
physician also suspect diet play big role infection 
frequency severity . 
exposure infectious agent 
result severe infection . 
strong immune response minimize 
length time need deal infection well symptom 
associate infection . 
> -- way build immunity resistance ? 
five major nutrient responsible good strong 
immune response infectious agent . 
: protein , vitamin c , 
vitamin , iron zinc . 
american diet low protein 
rarely problem . 
vitamin , vitamin c , iron zinc often low 
lack adequate pool nutrient reserve impair immune 
response . 
iron know low kid vitamin . 

distinct biochemical test run check status 
nutrient patient problem chronic severe 
infection . 
serum ferritin iron status , dark adaptation vitamin 
status , red blood cell zinc zinc status ascorbate 
vitamin c status . 
attempt work post five 
nutrient role infection news group well 
participate . 
e-mail work far . 
best advice try find physician recognize 
critical role diet play human immune response . 
may also 
able get help nutritionist . 
anyone call 
nutritionist . 
want find someone 
like formal training education nutrition . 
many ph.d. program u.s. offer degree nutrition 
need look . 
dietician also call 
nutritionist dietician biochemical training 
need run specialized nutritional assessment test . 
good 
get general dietary advice however .
