comment thermal recalibration general . 
new 
drive perform order increase overall integrity datum 
write . 
basically , firmware instruct actuator perform 
test see datum track within certain physical 
tolerance , since media heat cool , 
track drift inevitable , drive monitor . 

become especially critical high recording density , 
use primarily large-capacity mechanism , 
seem find way smaller drive way 
boost drive 's long-term reliability mtbf rating . 
first become aware thermal recalibration pointed 
technique conflict prolonged write time 
digitize , say , audio video hard disk . 
manufacturer 
explicitly state drive thermal recalibration 
use application prolong disk write . 
hope help .
