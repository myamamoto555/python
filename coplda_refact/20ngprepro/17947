jonathan , interesting question . 
wonder whether moon could 
ever support atmosphere . 
would interested know 
science friend think . 
human tolerance , best example human endurance term 
altitude i.e. low atmospheric pressure lower oxygen partial pressure 
opinion scaling mt. everest without oxygen assistance . 
accomplish team mountaineer train high 
altitude quite awhile think month fly 
helicopter training altitude equivalent altitude 
mount everest , begin ascent planet 's highest peak 
without oxygen tank . 
quite feat physiological endurance , 
try go 20,000 foot exert , would probably 
pass , get altitude sick , could even die cerebral edema . 

limit low pressure . 
high pressure situation would 
limit duration time take slowly acclimate higher 
pressure . 
skin diver would know alot high pressure situation 
could tell safely make deep dive without get 
bend . 
military experiment put people several atmosphere 
pressure sure high limit papers 
front . 
usually certain point , nitrogen air become 
toxic body start act idiotic . 
diver call nitrogen 
narcosis . 
afflict dangerous irrational thing , like 
take diving mask oxygen tank order talk fish 100 foot 
water . 
hope diving folk elaborate matter , 
diving expert . 
mars support human life without pressurization atmosphere 
thin th earth 's atmospheric density . 
addition , 
mars atmosphere mostly carbon dioxide . 
basically , would need 
pressure suit , would die low pressure . 
interesting huh ?
