x 
new 1993 : 
x 
x entry format better anyway . 
program 
x update . 
see entry format . 
x 
x reject entry compile use c 
x compiler . 
certain old obfuscation hack cause c compiler 
x fit longer permit . 
new issue deal 
x array type , variable number argument , c preprocessor

x 
x 
suggestion : 
x 
x encourage examine winner previous contest . 
see 
x information detail get previous winner . 
x 
x keep mind rule change year year , win entry 
x may valid entry year . 
unique novel one year 
x might ` old ' next year . 
x 
x entry usually examine number way . 
typically apply 
x number test entry : 
x 
x look original source 
x convert ansi ascii 
x c source ignore ' ' line 
x c source ignore ' ' ' ' line 
x run c 
x examine algorithm 
x lint 
x compile 
x execute 
x 
x consider entry look test . 
x ask entry remain obscure 
x ` clean ' c c . 
x 
x entry need well , test . 
certain 
x case , test important . 
entry compete 
x ` creative source layout ' need well 
x term algorithm . 
hand , give 
x two entry , inclined pick entry 
x something interesting run . 
x 
x try avoid limit creativity rule . 
, leave 
x contest open creative rule interpretation . 
real life 
x programming , interpret requirement document customer request 
x important . 
reason , often award ` worst abuse 
x rule ' entry illustrate point ironic way . 
x 
x plan abuse rule , suggest let know 
x remark section . 
please note invitation abuse 
x invitation break . 
strict come 
x byte size limit . 
also , abuse entry format tend 
x annoy amuse . 
x 
x realize hole rule , invite entry 
x attempt exploit . 
award ` worst abuse rule ' 
x plug hole next year . 
even , attempt use 
x smallest plug need , smaller . 
: - 
x 
x check program sure work . 
sometimes make 
x effort debug entry slight problem , particularly 
x near final round . 
hand , see 
x best entry fall work . 
x 
x tend look prime number printer , claim 
x 16 prime number . 
bug , better 
x document . 
note `` entry sometimes print 4th power 
x prime mistake '' would save entry . 
sometimes , 
x strange even help entry ! 
course , correctly 
x work entry best . 
x 
x 
like dislike : 
x 
x mass obscure source become ` old ' . 

x tend ` see thru ' mass due test 
x apply . 
simply abuse - bar go far 
x program well round confusion . 
x 
x many c compiler dislike follow code , : 
x 
x d define 
x #d foo < -- expect turn foo 
x 
x int ; 
x j ; < -- use implicit type declaration 
x int k ; 
x 
x suggest compile entry c compiler . 

x must use c , k&r c , must avoid area result 
x error c compiler . 
x 
x unfortunately , c require array index integral type . 
x thus , follow classical obfuscation hack longer allow : 
x 
x int ; 
x char c ; 
x c ; < -- use c instead 
x +3 `` string '' ; < -- use `` string '' +3 instead 
x 
x entry use function variable number 
x argument , careful . 
systems implement wide variety 
x way . 
, number operation use 
x portable must use : 
x 
x assign variable variable 
x cast variable variable 
x pass variable function expect arg 
x pass variable function expect arg 
x perform arithmetic variable 
x use structure union 
x 
x particular , treat variable char 's . 
x 
x avoid use , use instead . 
x 
x use c preprocessor directive , , , ... , 
x lead ' # ' must first character line . 

x c preprocessor allow whitespace lead ' # ' , many . 
x 
x exit function return void system , entry 
x must assume return int . 
x 
x small program best short , obscure concise . 
x program complex winner , 
x serve useful purpose . 
often program people 
x attempt completely understand . 
reason , look 
x program compact , instructional . 
x 
x one line program short one line program , say around 80 
x byte long . 
get close 160 byte bit long opinion . 
x 
x tend dislike program : 
x 
x hardware specific 
x os un x version specific 
x difference ok , specific 
x code likely 
x dump core compiler warning 
x ok warn ` remark ' header item 
x compile bsd sys v un x 
x abuse build file get around size limit 
x obfuscate excessive use 
x longer need 
x similar previous winner 
x identical previous loser : - 
x 
x unless cramp space , unless enter 
x ` best one liner ' category , suggest format program 
x creative way simply form excessively long line . 
x 
x build file use try get around size 
x limit . 
one thing make use several - d 's help , 
x quite another use 200 + byte - d 's order 
x try squeeze source size limit . 
feel 
x free make use build file space , better 
x show amount restraint . 
x 
x allow whitespace , certain case ; impact 
x program size certain point , want get 
x away source simply compact blob character . 
x 
x give two version program , one compact blob 
x code , format like typical c 
x program , tend favor second version . 
course , third 
x version program format interesting 
x obfuscate way , would definitely win first two ! 
x 
x suggest avoid try ` smallest ' 
x program . 
amaze many different size claim 
x smallest . 
nothing wrong self-replicating 
x program . 
fact , number winner self-replicating . 
x might want avoid claim ` smallest ' , lest 
x know smaller one ! 
x 
x x client entry portable possible . 
entry 
x adapt wide collection environment favor . 

x depend particular type display . 
example , depend 
x color give size . 
require backing store . 
x 
x x client entry avoid use x related library 
x software wide spread use . 
ask x client 
x entry restrict low level xlib 
x athena widget set . 
, , . 
x use m tif , xv ew , ok toolkit , since everyone 
x . 
avoid depend particular window manager . 

x everyone , people stick back 
x earlier , try target without require . 
better 
x yet , try make entry run version 11 x window systems . 
x 
x x client entry depend particular item 
x . 
. 
must , sure note required line 
x -- remark -- section . 
x 
x like program : 
x 
x concise small need 
x something least 
x pass lint without complaint requirement , nice 
x portable 
x unique novel obfuscation style 
x make use number different type obfuscation 
x make laugh throw : - 
x 
x type program excel area . 
course , 
x program excel area , well several 
x area really help . 
x 
x freely admit interesting , creative humorous comment 
x -- remark -- section help chance win . 

x read many twisted entry , would enjoy good laugh two . 
x think reader contest winner well . 
x 
x creative ! 
x 
x 
format : 
x 
x order help process many entry , must request 
x assistance format entry certain way . 
format , 
x addition , allow quickly separate information 
x author program . 
see judge process 
x 
x provide program , , example 
x format entry . 
aware follow warning 
x find : 
x 
x program attempt implement rule . 
every 
x attempt make make sure program produce 
x entry conform contest rule . 
case , 
x program differ contest rule , 
x contest rule use . 
sure check 
x contest rule submit entry . 
x 
x require use . 
convenient , however ,
