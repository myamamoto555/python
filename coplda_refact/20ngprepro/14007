think design use much retrieval

guess , base similar design fly large 
gro , uar . 
also , _ might _ consideration give mass 
requirement weight less conventional . 
finally , 
hst array _ _ ability detach -- remember , ` re 
go replace new array . 
however , ac guy see branch management pull 
collective hair hst , would voice hearty ` yea ' use 
conventional array , whenever possible . 
half hertz 
flexible mode , thermal snap , problem .
