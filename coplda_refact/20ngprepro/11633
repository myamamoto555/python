well , agree last one basic thing need 
statistic able predict player 's performance 
future correlation year year . 

player 's batting average correlate fairly well year year . 
player 's ability walk infielder 's defensive average correlate 
better . 
say , give past performance statistics 
pretty good handle 'll next year . 
put 
simple information aging even better . 
one 
basic problem something like `` clutch '' batting average - overall 
batting average correlation year year almost zero . 
add sample size seem help much . 
counterexample 
show , consider follow two player 1984-1987 : 
clutch 
ab h ba ab h ba 
maldonado 1060 260 .245 254 78 .307 
lemon 1643 457 .278 256 57 .223 
two player 1988 , logic , `` clutch '' 
situation , would bat maldonado lemon blink eye . 
well , 
1988 , maldonado hit .267 `` '' .190 `` clutch '' , lemon 
hit .254 `` '' .313 `` clutch '' . 
accuse 
completely cook datum , 96 player 25 + `` clutch '' 
bat every year 1984-1988 accord elias . 
simple 
measure , let 's look clutch ba . 
use 
' 84 - '87 predict '88 96 player , would find 27 
96 league average measure ' ' 88 , 
26 league average period 43 
one . 
flip coin , 
would expect get 24 48 switch . 

difference observe result coin flip experiment 
significant . 
btw , correlate player ' _ overall _ batting average ' 84 - '87 
'88 give correlation coefficient 0.59 , significant 
something better 99.9 % confidence level . 
correlate 
ba period give correlation 
, significant level interest . 
> 
> 
everyone would agree hope grand 
slam bottom ninth team three 
clutch hit . 
way predict 
likely get clutch hit base past performance hit 
`` clutch '' situation . 

> 
> say , dave . 
way . 
> 
actually , technically incorrect say predict future 
clutch performance . 
correct say predict 
future clutch performance skill .
