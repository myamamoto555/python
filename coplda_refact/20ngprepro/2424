interesting seminar work uk 's space science 
dept. subject , specifically small-scale solar sail 
propose student space project . 
guy give talk keen 
generate interest project . 
'll handout give 
meeting . 
go : 
microlight solar sail 
------------------------- 
1 . 
introduction 
solar sail well-established concept . 
harness pressure 
sunlight , spacecraft would unlimited range . 
principle , 
vehicle could explore whole solar system zero fuel consumption . 
however difficult design practical solar sail 
people realize . 
pressure sunlight one kilogram per 
square kilometer . 
deploy control large area aluminized 
fabric would necessary transport ` conventional ' type 
spacecraft daunting task . 
, despite potential hte 
idea , craft actually launch date . 
2 . 
design 
recent advance microelectronics make possible different concept : 
tiny sail metre diameter could control purely 
electronics , mechanical part . 
several attitude control 
method feasible : example pressure sunlight exert 
panel solar cell vary accord whether power draw . 
key component craft minute ccd camera develop 
edinburgh university act attitude sensor datum 
gather device ; solar cell provide ~ 1 watt power control 
communication ; directional radio antenna etch onto surface 
sail . 
launch piggyback payload , total cost 
mission limit ten thousand dollar . 
3 . 
mission 
craft would capable ambitious mission . 
example : 
could rendezvous nearby asteroid apollo amor 
group . 
closeup picture could transmit back earth low bit 
rate . 
b could steer lunar polar orbit . 
previously unobserved 
area around lunar pole could view . 
angle sail 
reflect sunlight downward , polar crater whose basis never receive 
sunlight could image . 
bright reflection would confirm 
volatile water ice become trap 
location . 
immensely valuable information set man lunar 
base , btw 
c could send rendezvous small asteroid comet 
nucleus . 
impact low speed , thin wire probe attach craft 
cause capture tiny sample sharp-edged 
tube , like perform biopsy . 
return earth , sail act 
ideal re-entry parachute : load per unit area 20 ensure heat 
sail temperature exceed ~ 300 
deg c. material sample recover , enclose small insulate 
container .

-------------------------------- 
guy would love hear anyone interested project 
seek detail anything , would happy send 
information .
