perhaps trust escrow agency one come 
s1 s2 , agency really trust aclu & nra 
interesting example , hope 'll use physical 
process come truly random number . 
nsa come 
number , trap door could drive truck .

either . 
seem follow start 
question : 

april 16 , 1993 
washington , dc 
computer professional call public 
debate new government encryption initiative 
computer professional social responsibility 
today call public disclosure technical datum 
underlie government 's `` public encryption 
management '' initiative . 
new cryptography scheme 
announce today white house national institute 
standards technology nist , implement 
technical specification plan . 
nist spokesman 
acknowledge national security agency nsa , super - 
secret military intelligence agency , actually develop 
encryption technology around new initiative build . 
accord nist , technical specification 
presidential directive establish plan classify . 

open initiative public review debate , today 
file series freedom information act foia request 
key agency , include nsa , nist , national security 
council fbi information relate encryption

request keep spirit 
computer security act , congress pass 1987 order 
open development non-military computer security standard 
public scrutiny limit nsa 's role creation 
standard . 
previously question role nsa 
develop so-called `` digital signature standard '' dss , 
communication authentication technology nist propose 
government-wide use 1991 . 
sue nist 
lawsuit last year , civilian agency disclose first 
time nsa , fact , develop security standard . 
nsa due file papers federal court next week justify 
classification record concern creation 
dss . 
david sobel , legal counsel , call 
administration 's apparent commitment privacy 
electronic communication , reflect today 's official 
statement , `` step right direction . '' 
question 
propriety nsa 's role process apparent 
secrecy thus far shield development process 
public scrutiny . 
`` time move towards 
development new information infrastructure , vital 
standard design protect personal privacy 
establish openly full public participation . 

appropriate nsa -- agency long tradition 
secrecy opposition effective civilian cryptography -- 
play lead role development process . ''
