read far much aside obvious fact 
hold anybody write 10 year old 
book rapidly change field like . 
quite simply say security depend 
secrecy algorithm . 
secret algorithm still secure , 
, know . 
level trust 
affect , security system . 
algorithm could rsa know , believe 
secure . 
much better reason classify algorithm 
protect security . 
want protect market share . 
publish algorithm , shortly manufacturer would 
make chip implement algorithm standard 
use key store escrow . 
course , everybody would buy . 
whole push chip establish standard 
use follow rule , get follow 
rule without enact new law would fight tooth 
nail . 
quite simply , clipper establish , would much harder 
another encryption maker define new standard , make phone 
talk lead phone company . 
result 
cryptography without law forbid kind , 99 % 
populace . 
get crypto , would build special phone 
run top system , everybody talk would 
one . 
chicken egg crypto . 
government use 
special ability solve chicken egg problem new 
technology control one way like . 
almost admirably clever . 
eff start , pose question 
`` police go wake discover 
wiretap ? '' 
nobody answer even think 
much question 
come backdoor digital telephony bill , fight . 
real answer , cleverest .
