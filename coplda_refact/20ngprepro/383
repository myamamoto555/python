would 
trust confidential information encryption scheme , 
say $ 100,000 could crack one time hundred ? 
des , 
complaint 56-bit key , would probably cost several million dollar 
build machine .

oh , big brother afford thing time tight 
budget ? 
know many folk notice , dorothy `` trust '' denning give 
real clue current state art nsa machine 
say nsa tell even want holder 
part key . 
? 
doubt trapdoor skipjack . 

never know . 
doubt nsa would promote mass market chip 
could compromise . 
ergo , nsa capable compromise probably 
brute force engine complexity skipjack . 
look 
spec . 
, bet thousand little chip chug 
away crypto buster ... maybe even ten thousand . 
complexity ? 
much 3090 . 
many machine fit fort meade ? 
think .3 256 bit idea key ...
