3 general info injury 
first , foremost importance : experience pain , 
absolutely need go see doctor . 
soon possibly . 

difference day two mean difference short recovery 
long , drawn-out ordeal . 
go see doctor . 
, 
doctor may necessarily familiar sort injury . 
generally , 
hospital occupational therapy clinic offer specialist 
kind problem . 
wait , though . 
go see doctor . 
remainder information paraphrase , without permission , 
wonderful report new zealand 's department labor occupational 
safety health service : `` occupational overuse syndrome . 
treatment 
rehabilitation : practitioner 's guide '' . 
first , glossary , fancy name hand : 
note : likely hear term doctor keyboard vendor : 
rsi : repetitive strain injury - general term many kind injury 
oos : occupational overuse syndrome -- synonym 
ctd : cumulative trauma disorder -- another synonym 
: work-related upper limb disorders -- yet another synonym 
cts : carpal tunnel syndrome see 
hyperextension : marked bend joint . 
pronation : turn palm . 
wrist extension : bend wrist . 
supination : turn palm . 
wrist flexion : bend wrist . 
pinch grip : grip use pencil . 
ulnar deviation : bend wrist towards little finger . 
power grip : grip use hammer . 
radial deviation : bend wrist toward thumb . 
abduction : move away body . 
: open finger wide . 
, problem come two main type : local condition diffuse 
condition . 
local problem would expect : specific muscle , 
tendon , tendon sheath , nerve , etc. inflamed otherwise hurt . 
diffuse condition , often mistaken local problem , involve muscle 
discomfort , pain , burn tingle ; identifiable area 
tenderness muscle , although necessarily `` problem . '' 
-- occupational overuse syndrome occur ? 
theory . 
normally , muscle tendon get blood capillary 
pass among muscle fiber . 
tense muscle , restrict 
blood flow . 
time exert 50 % full power , 
completely restrict blood flow . 
without fresh blood , muscle use store energy run , 
switch anaerobic without oxygen metabolism , generate 
nasty by-product like lactic acid , cause pain . 
one muscle hurt , neighbor tense , perhaps relieve 
load . 
make sense normal sort injury , make 
thing worse repetitive motion . 
tension mean less blood flow , 
cycle continue . 
another by-product lack blood flow tingling numbness 
nerve . 
need blood . 
anyway , typing much , never really give change 
blood get back belong , muscle never 
relax enough let blood . 
stress , poor posture , poor 
ergonomics , make thing worse . 
-- specific injury may hear : 
note : injury come two flavor : acute chronic . 
acute 
injury severely painful noticable . 
chronic condition 
less pronounced symptom every bit real . 
-- inflamation tendon sheath . 
chronic 
occur repetitive activity mild intermittent : enough 
cause acute inflamation , enough exceed tendon sheath 's ability 
lubricate tendon . 
result , tendon sheath thicken , get 
inflamed , get problem . 
tendonitis -- inflammation tendon . 
repeated tensing tendon 
cause inflamation . 
eventually , fiber tendon start separate , 
even break , leave behind debris induce friction , 
swell , pain . 
`` '' tendonitis common , entail 
dull ache wrist forearm , tenderness , get worse 
repetitive activity . 
carpal tunnel syndrome -- nerve run wrist 
finger get trap inflamed muscle around . 
symptom include 
feel `` pin needle '' , tingle , numbness , even loss sensation . 
ct often confuse diffuse condition . 
adverse mechanical tension -- also know ` neural tension ' , 
nerve run arm become contract possibly 
compress result muscle spasm shoulder elsewhere . 
amt often misdiagnosed associate one oo 
disorder . 
largely reversible treat physiotherapy 
brachial plexus stretch trigger point therapy . 
: every part body , fancy name 
way injure . 
, get idea oos 
condition occur . 
careful : many inexperienced doctor 
misdiagnose problem carpal tunnel syndrome , reality , 
may completely different problem . 
always get second opinion 
somebody something drastic like surgery . 
4 typing posture , ergonomics , prevention , treatment 
important element prevention recovery reduce 
tension muscle tendon . 
require learn relax . 
load stress , doubly important . 
tune 
world breath deep regular . 
relax become guide 
principle work : every three minute take three second break . 
every three minute , take three second break . 
really , every 
three minute . 
also helpful work comfortable surroundings , 
calm , relax . 
sleep , really need focus . 
rest , sleep , 
relaxation really big deal . 
kind treatment , course . 
drug reduce 
inflamation pain . 
splint forcefully prevent bad 
posture . 
surgery fix problem . 
exercise help strengthen 
muscle . 
regular stretch help prevent injury . 
good posture 
good ergonomic workspace promote reduce tension . 
ice 
contrast bath also reduce swell . 
doctor say best 
. 
-- posture -- basic guideline . 
like way 
write new zealand book lift almost verbatim 
appendix 10 . 
-- 
. 
let shoulder relax . 
. 
let elbow swing free . 
. 
keep wrist straight . 
. 
pull chin look - flop head forward . 
. 
keep hollow base spine . 
. 
try lean back chair . 
. 
slouch slump forward . 
. 
alter posture time time . 
. 
every 20 minute , get bend spine backward . 
set seat height , first . 
foot flat floor . 

undue pressure underside thigh near knee , 
thigh slope much . 
, draw desk see height comfortable 
work . 
short , may impossible . 
remedy 
raise seat height prevent leg dangle use 
footrest . 
, adjust backrest height buttock fit space 
backrest seat pan . 
backrest support 
hollow back , adjust tilt give firm support 
area . 
operate keyboard , able spend time lean 
back , experiment chair taller backrest , available . 
, diverge little text 
good chair make big difference . 
like chair , go 
find better one . 
really want adjustment height , back angle , 
back height , maybe even seat tilt . 
arm rest seem get 
way , although expensive chair height adjustable arm 
rest also rotate way . 
find good 
store play chair -- pick one right . 
san francisco bay area , highly recommend `` chair . '' 

name say . 
-- keyboard drawer , wrist pad , keyboard replacement : 
fair amount controvery get right . 

people , wrist pad seem work wonder . 
however , good posture , 
rest wrist anything -- would prefer 
keyboard `` right '' . 
drop arm side 
lift hand elbow , want keyboard hand 
elbow 90 degree . 
course , want avoid 
pronation , wrist extension , ulnar deviation cost . 
wrist pad 
may may help . 
get somebody else come 
look work : sit , type , relax . 

often easier somebody else notice hunch shoulder 
deviate hand . 
argue normal , flat keyboard antiquated poorly 
design . 
number replacement available , market , today . 
check accompany much detail .
