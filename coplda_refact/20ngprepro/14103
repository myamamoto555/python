hmmmmm ...

amp good sound , 
word , `` bearing ... '' . 
, suggest everyone run create combination 
degrade lifespan , 
circuit much temperature 
variation current one . 
since 
junction resistance function temperature , detrimental 
effect linearity . 
fact : 
- bias point vary temperature 
- junction resist temp 
- adcom product run class-a 
still beleive assertion , consider warm-up requirement 
good test equipment , better yet , listen amplifier 
warm-up . 
many design quite audible , mine , 20 minute 
output stage , many hour driver . 
fortunately driver 
switch . 
experiment , draw conclusion listen , 
seperate effect device temperature bias 
idle current level . 
positive correlation low 
distortion `` good '' sound quality , high bias result 
warmer operation , factor equal .
