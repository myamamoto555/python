problem , certain solve 
correct way . 
wonder anyone shed light , point 
right place look ... 
x-ray imaging camera metallic tube cylindrical hole 
pass right angle tube 's axis : 
| 
| | image 
| 
x-ray source | | | screen 
metallic | | tube | 
| | | 
| 
know source -- screen center distance , radius tube , radius hole . 
calculation base image hole screen . 
however , 
calculation mathematically highly complex , must assume 
object 's hole project image resemble ellipse tube 
parallel screen center screen . 
however , unlikely 
object place conveniently . 
firstly , must transform major minor axis ellipse . 

know angle tube screen . 
assume 
parallel transformation ? 
transformation ? 
secondly , distortion image due screen planar 
source -- screen distance increase move away center 
screen . 
compensate ellipse 's axis image distortion ? 
, please anyone give pointer ? 
transform 
image appear would center screen , 
deal distortion due shape screen ? 
would appreciate help , either post email . 
thanks advance , simon .
