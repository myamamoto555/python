society accept risk 
innocent person murder execution .

include sort malicious intent , involve

murder violate golden rule . 
execution , allow 
, society implicitly accept consequence matter 
innocent victim .

read mind jury would certainly tell whether conviction 
moral . 
, objective system , absolute truth 
matter , jury system one method approximate truth . 

, twelve member must convince truth .

, read mind people , would know 
conviction unfair . 
, would perfectly fair could read mind ? 
assume 
would fair know absolute truth , much less 
fair , opinion , good approximation absolute 
truth ?

yes , could objectively determine difference know 
possible information , always determine difference 
flawed system . 
think system almost good possible , 
still objectively perfect . 
see , matter 
know fair . 
objectively , either fair . 
> huge difference . 
read mind , know ,

difference

know effect objective system . 
think possible produce fairly objective system , 
clear goal suppose promote .

sure ?

reality , remember .

simply know . 
, assume system fairly decent , least likely . 
, realize correctness system say nothing 
totally ideal objective system .

people seem willing .
