? 
| 
| frequently ask question . 
every time arise , cause 
| month debate . 
let see answer directly . 
| basically law give moses part 
| specific jews . 
jews , 
| part covenant . 
argument early 
| christian history whether mosaic law apply 
| gentile become christian . 
see account 
| debate act 15 . 
main question circumcision , 
| keep sabbath would part well . 
apostle 
| conclude need become jews order become christian , 
| therefore rule circumcision apply . 
1 . 
law know man reveal mount sinai . 
rom 
4:15 note `` law , transgression . '' 

sin exist sinai eden , sabbath keep 
reveal sinai ex 16 . 
2 . 
problem first covenant law , promise 
undergird . 
god want perform life 
people , ignorance 400 year slavery , promise 
`` ever say . '' 
new covenant 
base `` better promise '' heb . 
. 
rather away law 
god promise `` put law mind write 
heart '' heb . 
8:10 . 
3 . 
include sabbath act 15 selective inclusion . 

sabbath important jews circumcision . 
attempt 
make away sabbath reaction would 
even strident record act 15 . 
confuse weekly 
sabbath decalogue ceremonial sabbath could occur 
time week part law ceremonial 
add transgression moral law gal 3:19 . 
4 . 
israel stand god 's people time . 
god graft 
gentiles . 
roma 9:4 say adoption , glory , 
covenant , give law , service god promise 
belong israelites . 
explanation paul make clear bear 
israel enough `` israel , 
israel '' v 6 . 
gal 3:19 say `` ye christ 's , ye 
abraham 's seed , heir accord promise . '' 
christian 
abraham 's seed , jews , israelites . 
physically , 
criterion , spiritually . 
joint heir jesus base 
promise god make people israelites . 
| 
| christian agree ot laws apply , 
| part specific jews , 
| also expect see similarity thing god expect 
| jews thing expect . 
, 
| god . 
however several way deal . 
| 
| day common approach separate ot commandment 
| `` moral '' `` ceremonial '' . 
ceremonial commandment apply 
| jews . 
part specific mosaic covenant . 

| like kosher law circumcision . 
moral law apply 
| everyone . 
10 command part moral law , except 
| commandment sabbath . 
believe people take 
| approach would say specific requirement worship 
| sabbath part ceremonial law , general obligation 
| worship regularly part general moral law . 
thus christian 
| free choose specific time worship . 
people would probably agree wrong . 
sabbath 
commandment ceremonial part law predate 
ceremonial law ? 
free choose time worship . 
even 
follow day worship origin pagan 
sun worship . 
would rather give day god bless , 
sanctify , hallowed exchange one church leader 
agree biblical foundation see sabbath admissions 
. 
| 
| radical approach generally connect john calvin 
| reformed tradition say law whole longer 
| binding . 
instead , entirely grace , behavior 
| guide solely love . 
portion ot law still 
| useful guidance . 
properly speak legally 
| binding . 
practice people take position 
| believe safe leave christian without moral . 

| may longer law , sinner , safe go 
| situation principle guide . 
good 
| self-justification safe . 
thus christian moral 
| guidance , thing like jesus ' teaching , paul 's advice , etc. . 
| may precisely law , serve much 
| function , largely content , `` moral law '' 
| previous analysis . 
calvin would deny fix 
| legal responsibility worship specific day , would say 
| give human weakness , discipline regular worship important . 
| 
care calvin theologian say . 
guide god 
say . 
law mean keep law , 
section law trouble 
sabbath commandment , one god thought important 
enough say remember ? 
study word deeply note 
message longer condemnation law 
free grace god . 
cop pull speeding , 
court ask mercy judge throw book give 
grace , walk court say `` go speeding , 
grace ? '' 
grace drive within speed 
limit . 
paul add rom . 
3:31 `` di make void law 
faith ? 
god forbid : yea , establish law . '' 
`` wherefore law 
holy , commandment holy , , good '' rom . 
7:12 . 
| analysis , specific day issue . 
matter 
| tradition , worship sunday memorial christ 's 
| resurrection . 
debate act show early 
| christian worship . 
common analysis show jewish 
| christian continue go jewish service sabbath , 
| specifically christian service necessarily hold . 
| act show worship first day sunday , cor also 
| imply gathering day . 
| 
| group continue believe christian 
| worship sabbath saturday . 
best-known seventh-day 
| adventists jehovah 's witness . 
argue act 
| regular worship service , special meeting see paul , 
| cor explicitly say regular worship service . 
prefer implication fact ? 
careful study act 20 show 
meeting saturday night sunday morning paul 
go worship service , set long journey foot 
asso . 
16 way equate `` lay store '' 
`` go worship service . '' 
| 
| clear issue contest one paul 's time . 
see 
| rom . 
paul 's advice careful 
| judge issue like . 
one person see specific 
| day mandate god , another . 
observe 
| specific day honor lord . 
believe 
| worship free restriction also honor 
| lord . 
believe sabbath still mandate argue 
| paul refer sabbath worship . 
note however col 
| 2:16 , say something similar briefer . 
explicitly 
| mention sabbath . 
wrong . 
sabbath day ceremonial law , sabbath 
day moral law . 
| 
| difference among christian use word 
| `` sabbath '' . 
originally term refer 7th day , jewish 
| day worship . 
many christian use refer sunday , 
| day christian worship . 
largely apply 
| 4th whatever -- couple different numbering 
| scheme commandment . 
reformed tradition . 

| distinguish sabbath -- observance mandate 
| jews , lord 's day -- free christian worship . 
| reference find nt rev 1:10 . 

| also difference law regard day . 
many christian 
| support `` blue law '' , secular law church law , set aside 
| day cause people spend worship . 
radical 
| approach see regulation return jewish 
| sabbath , appropriate free christian worship 
| lord 's day . 
| 
would prefer twist turn , rely different argument 
conflict , rather obey simple request 
god love enough die . 
jesus die law could 
change . 
bother die order meet demand 
broken law need change law . 
penalty law 
break mean law immutable . 
sin 
follow demand ceremonial law . 
always sin 
make false god , violate god 's name , break sabbath , steal , 
kill , etc. . 
except disagree . 
opinion weight 
place next word god . 
darius 
clear much need say faq . 

think paul 's comment esteem one day another rom 14 
probably need say . 
accept darius 
honor lord . 
wish might equally 
accept `` esteem day alike '' similarly 
best honor lord . 
however would like clear think unambiguous 
proof regular christian worship first day . 

indicate , response passage cite . 
difficulty passage actually 
something else . 
look like talk 
christian meeting , neither explicitly say `` 
gather every sunday worship '' . 
get various piece 
information , nothing aim answer question . 
act 2:26 describe christian participate jewish temple 
worship christian communion service home . 
obviously 
temple worship sabbath . 
act 13:44 example 
christian participate . 
unfortunately tell 
day christian meet house . 
act , despite darius ' 
confusion , describe act occur sunday . 
see 
reason impose modern definition day start , 
biblical text clear mean . 
wording imply 
normal meeting . 
say gather 
see paul , gather break bread , 
paul talk travel . 
explicit 
enough really convincing . 
similarly 1 cor . 
say 
first day set aside money paul 's 
collection . 
want believe gather specially 
, home , disprove , 
obvious time congregation take offering would 
normally gather worship , expect 
home would reason mention specific day . 
think obvious reading `` first day 
every week '' simply mean every time gather worship . 
think reason implication clear statement 
nt author assume reader know christian 
worship .
