um ... 
1 professor plain wrong . 
although blue led one heck 
lot less efficient red one . 
2 `` typical visible light led '' really exist . 
led fairly 
narrow region . 
since fermi energy around either side 
band gap fall exponentially , blah , blah ...

: - 
blue led certainly exist , get bunch work . 
cree research 
make probably along company ... cree big 
material science , though ; advertise stuff like physics today , 
etc. . 
buy think , definitely , 
plenty distributor . 
actually , day _ _ get `` typical visible light '' lead -- 
call `` rainbow lead '' , forget make advertise 
edn many trade rag , though . 
combine reg , green , 
blue lead one chip four lead . 
nifty device , although 
probably fairly expensive .
