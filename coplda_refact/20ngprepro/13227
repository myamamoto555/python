already respond one dimension , afterthought cause 
make another , independent reply . 
problem `` moment 
silence '' even-handed way `` allow '' religion 
amongst student public school . 
note , muslims need 
moment silence order perform prayer 
require muhammad . 
least orthodox jewish prayer also 
requirement address . 
, fact , highly selective bias towards christian prayer 
`` moment silence '' shit . 
especially bizarre 
christian prayer need stuff -- christain may pray totally 
incognito time extent , true muslims jews 
well -- intend first paragraph 
characteristic form prayer religion need special 
time behavior , undertake without observer 
able take note . 
christian may pray , time -- silently without trace 
activity evident . 
may may true 
religious tradition amongst : certainly , tend 
form prayer would evidence difference 
`` mainstream '' religion . 
`` moment silence '' allow one tradition 
need , `` special '' place set aside public school . 
nothing christian prayer require public form , rug , 
, anything else visible outside world . 

christian student may probably pray innumerable time 
day , without anyone else know . 
may also true non - 
christian -- otherwise . 
`` moment silence '' 
would still difficult jews gather daven , muslims 
ablutions find mecca engage prescribe 
form . 
course christian thing -- therefore , 
provision nothing disguised attempt encourage . 
luckily , strong jewish presence country , 
christian , revere jewish teacher public school , 
grow muslim presence well . 
hope political 
force consequent prevent imposition christian form 
non-christian . 
far see christian nothing `` moment 
silence '' campaign attempt use public social pressure force 
child adhere pattern bias towards christianity . 

christian , must protest coercion . 
worth , 
suspect coercion really target non-christian -- 
yet another case failure amongst christian parent `` make '' 
child prayerful , want public school teach 
manage teach , despite opportunity 
world . 
teach child pray , need moment 
silence school . 
manage teach , moment 
embarrass . 
give .
