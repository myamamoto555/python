hate follow post , perhaps clarify 
thing get flame . 
first , talk `` factor modulus '' 
`` breakthrough factoring '' , really mean breakthrough 
cryptanalysis rsa . 
know factor break rsa 
prove equivalent ; damn convenient 
repeat every time . 
also admit really know `` '' 
property cipher essential key chaining . 

think little , find way 
cryptanalyst could exploit group structure . 
, course , mean 
nothing . 
write ,

mean long advantage 
cryptanalyst faster computer , probably rsa 
long time come , even modulus somehow could 
break fast computer new algorithm , people 
would simply use longer modulus . 
user cryptanalyst benefit 
better technology way . 
hope keep flame away ... fun .
