spacecraft shut fund cut . 

example , could magellan tell go `` safe '' 
mode stay bob venus mode 
maybe year funding get restore economy 
get better hopefully , could turn . 
matter , exactly apollo lunar experiment 
`` turn '' rather `` safe '' . 
political i.e. 
along could use , someone would keep bugging 
congress fund ? 
turn keep pesky 
scientist bureaucrat 's hair ... 
hear argument active `` uncontrolled '' 
spacecraft cause `` radio noise . '' 
find hard believe 
could problem properly design `` safe '' mode . 
safe mode could program routine cause 
spacecraft go least fuel use orientation , 
week , month , year , whatever attempt signal lock earth . 
time , funding restore , mission 
continue . 
signal recieve , spacecraft go back 
safe mode another time period . 
would know 
spacecraft go try contact earth , could 
prepare necessary . 
another spacecraft could attempted contact 
beam store datum towards earth . 
someone receive , 
great , , lose big deal . 
make time signal location generally know , perhaps 
someone world might able willing intercept 
datum even willing contact spacecraft . 
see particularly useful spacecraft 
could otherwise long life go 
place otherwise orbit , 
exit solar system , etc . 
perhaps design future spacecraft cassini , pluto flyby , 
etc consider design `` pause '' mode case 
spacecraft get ax sometime future completion 
primary mission . 
perhaps mars observer could 
kind routine write post mission 
`` drift '' phase . 
hole ?
