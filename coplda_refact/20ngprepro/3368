problem fresh vegetable , guess 
obstruction intestine . 
without know 
possible say whether obstruction permanent due scarring , 
temporary due swell inflammed intestine . 
general , 
dietary limitation patient crohn 's except relate 
obstruction . 
evidence food bring 
recurrence crohn 's . 
important distinguish recurrence 
recurrent symptom . 
physician would think new inflammation 
recurrence , pain raw imply narrowing 
intestine . 
friend look membership crohn 's colitis 
foundation america . 

good luck friend .
