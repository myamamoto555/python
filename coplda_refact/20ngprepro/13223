hmm ... 48 bit aye ? 
well , beat 32-bit design thee sake . 
48 bit mean 16 bit per primary color . 
2 ^ 48 nr color bit misleading . 
make sense see 
65536 possible shades pure red . 
might actually make sense , since 256 shades red 24 bit color 
may produce visible ` jump ' intensity . 
, byte per primary color pixel elegant way 
color graphic , leave ya tidy fast program 
code . 
take care ,
