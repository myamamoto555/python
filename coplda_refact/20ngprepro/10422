like gui 's : 
- ability view manipulate group object , file , 
text , directory , etc. manipulate way 
delete , copy , paste , rename ... 
- ability several application screen visible 
time . 
- able standard set function easily 
quickly unfamiliar operating system . 
familiar 
command line several operate system occasionally 
work system almost never use . 
gui , usually accomplish want 
fairly easily , command line hand often 
long painful experience . 
hate gui 's : 
- switch mouse keyboard . 
guess 
strong one-handed preference . 
like use 
computer one hand use hold something 
like piece paper mug tea . 
configure 
favorite editor editing function 
one hand navigate , cut , pasting , 
search , open save file , etc. . 
main thing 
need use hand enter text . 
guess need get one mouse , like , 20 button
