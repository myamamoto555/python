, make custom equipment case , 
roll clipper implementation report wrong key 
escrow agency ? 
tell go chip business 
thing go -- nsa , something hide 
nsa . 
anyone verify phone use key register 
serial number , either : 
1 court order wiretap . 
go 
? 
tell judge individual really privacy ? 
know key enough , . 
2 court order wiretap phone series . 
part really scary . 
since `` expectation '' 
chip particular batch use seed base s1 
s2 serial number , get key one batch may give 
access . 
3 backdoor allow message decipher 
without key . 
find one especially threaten since 
scheme seem open known plaintext attack . 
need 
decipher datum header . 
talk someone one 
phone , presumably automatically negotiate 
key generate . 
try decipher record 
conversation know say , use known plaintext 
recover backdoor represent header , know 
header say conversation participate . 
even worse , 
phone series relate key , buy 
production lot . 
recover key , either elegantly 
talk , brute force analysis actual chip , 
apply key generation process seed find target 
key . 
hmmm ! 
think want ever come close phone . 
even des start look good . 
two string provide 
much better security .
