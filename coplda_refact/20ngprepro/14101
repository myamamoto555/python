thanks . 
well , fastest , crudest mixer aside physically connect 
input together directly run signal 
resistor common output . 
resistor give isolation 
signal source drive directly . 
take wild , guess , would say mix 
source like dynamic mike , electric guitar pickup , 
etc. , resistor ought maybe 5k - 10k . 
mix 
stuff output walkman , , would go 1k . 
input 1 -- \ \ \ ------------- + -- output

input 2 -- \ \ \ \ ------------- +

input 3 -- \ \ \ \ ------------- +
