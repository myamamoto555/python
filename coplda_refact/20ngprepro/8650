describe close build describe 
10th arrl computer network conference proceedings . 
build 10 watt fsk transceiver 904 mhz . 
essentially 
double conversion digital mod 29 mhz . 
receiver use fsk receiver chip use 
2 mbp 10 ghz datum link first publish ham 
radio also arrl handbook . 
, include vhf converter section , could also use 
speed . 
newer perhaps slightly improved design 
remember rightly . 
use would let reduce `` external '' count 
receive , really offer much help transmit 
bother . 
radio build first design build 512 kbp 2 
mhz channel later reduce half . 
256 kbp radio 
actually quite well test 384 kbp 
speed pretty much function filter design . 
handle datum 
stream another matter entirely . 
exist radio currently deploy hilltop 
`` beacon '' test mode . 
yet two-way datum flow 
due lack resource debug software digital hardware mio 
also show cnc proceedings , datum perfect copy . 
even 
though datum clock currently half speed , 2 + 
test text chapter 55 isaiah take little 
second . 
hope someone would get interested enough step 
get involve write code make whole thing usable borland 
ide environment remote debugging possible mention 
proceedings date couple run 
low resource time , money energy . 
anyone sf bay area want check also cw 
id text mark side mhz beacon sonoma 
mtn black mtn overlook si valley . 
antenna horizontally 
polarize . 
guess retrospect suggestion fairly costly 
approach radio intend user rather backbone 
might want carefully consider `` target '' . 

arrange path complete line-of-sight think 
'll want address cause 
multipath probably link budget path far los . 
detail , see 10th cnc . 
currently work spread 
spectrum , direct conversion design address problem . 
would glad help design problem .
