, `` believe god exist '' `` believe god exist '' . 
word , think statement like god somehow interfere 
world false meaningless . 
ontology , one fairly 
conclude `` exist '' meaningless exist . 

pragmatic definition truth , `` exist '' meaningless make exist 
even logically false . 
problem statement one disprove subjective god 
definition , might case subjective god would even 
make sense . 
trouble god definition include 
form objective existence consequence god affect 
. 
believer derive right interfere life .
