note : cable freak , might completely 
misunderstand say . 
also , math frequently note 
wrong , 'll better check calculation . 
assume 14.4 k mean 14.4 k bit . 
assume one start 
one , protocol overhead , effective number byte 
per second 1.44 k. 
let 's also assume want transmit speech 
stereo , send 1,440 . 
correspond 
nyquist frequency 720 hz , low , especially 
think 8-bit low quality sound . 
furthermore , 
converter probably present signal 
cut 720 hz , instead alia higher 
frequency . 
although definitely build filter overcome 
problem . 
hand , speech easily compressible . 
example , 
could form power spectrum , could simply band-pass filter 
fourier transform . 
cd quality sound , 
'll discernible . 
power spectrum method good 
respect . 
program software compressor , 
compression rate 90 % relative error due linearization 
less 5 % common . 
although must say musical 
sound , speech . 
fun .
