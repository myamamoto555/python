believe fundamental difference . 
x 
three instrument focus instrument , , less , form 
image , positional error limit craft attitude 
resolve power optics . 
altogether different 
beast , effectively 8 coincidence counter , one corner 
craft . 
positional information triangulate 
differential signal arrival time detector . 
positional error would predominantly determine time error 
error craft attitude . 
since none 8 baste detector 
independant angular resolution whatsoever , use 
determine parallax . 
indeed , parallax would add small 
component positional error . 
demonstrate puppy beyond oort cloud would 
require resolution order arcsecond , since oort 
cloud postulate extend 0.5 parsec together 
: `` parallax arc second '' , parsec distance object 
demonstrate one arc second parallax 2 au base line . 
3 degree accuracy report true , go 
add baste pluto fast flyby get enough baseline . 
beauty baste give positional information 
watch entire sky simultaneously , realy handy combination 
idea next burst come .
