begin suspect real difficulty 
truth , simply language . 
say glass 
half empty contradiction statement half 
full : fact express different word . 
whole 
point phrase illustrate different way pessimist 
optimist express fact . 
, course , quite true different people may express 
belief different word . 
also true may fail 
understand 's word expression belief 
may argue bitterly believe mile apart . 
great 
occur way , much ecumenical work 
simply resolve difference language conceal 
agreement belief . 
mean , sense , belief 
equally valid . 
since belief people hold contradict 
belief people hold , obfuscation 
language culture expression belief 
strip away , belief people hold must , 
false , neither arrogant illogical 
say . 
believe x believe y may correct , 
y equivalent one wrong long 
hold respective belief , must regard 
error .
