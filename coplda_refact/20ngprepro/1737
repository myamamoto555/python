authorities sometimes tell people evil thing . 
people `` 
follow order '' tortured kill large number , 
protest innocence afterwards . 
authority start tell thing , ask 
question . 
except situation press need `` say shut 
hatch submarine fill water ! '' 
, reasonable 
authority able give least justification 
understand . 
sure listen authority answer . 
anybody interested question psychological pressure 
follow order , might want read study solomon ashe 
1951 conformity , another stanley milgram 1963 
obedience . 
good book . 

result fascinating terrifying .
