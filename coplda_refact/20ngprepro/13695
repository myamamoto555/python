marvin minsky hi write build `` perceptron ? '' 
1950s use 
motor-driven potentiometer vary weight . 
report circuit 
work even tho wiring error . 
say robust ? 
sulfide cell vary light . 
cmo ttl gate provide sigmoid 
transfer function often use . 
low power schottky gate , earlier gate , gain x8 . 
led probably output enough light easily control cd cell , even 
ma . 
paper dark light region , control pencil 
eraser , could also control cd resistance . 
high input resistance 
cmo gate may let charge cap serve memory .
