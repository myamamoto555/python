always two-way street . 
god give grace avoid sin , 
thus visit gabriel , give fiat , total 
acceptance god 's . 
fiat summarize catholics regard 
highest human , god choose 
accept . 
know advance , extrapolate 
neither stain subject original sin . 
god create miraculously free choose choose sin . 
`` sufficient day evil thereof grace god 
command . '' 
amount grace precisely determine god 
amount require god ask . 
grace 
give also enough , always choose 
accept . 
also believe jesus fully human never 
sin . 
god could create much better person , one 
always choose right thing , yet create instead , despite 
flaw . 
prove love , continually draw 
towards perfection . 
whatever purpose , 
confidence accomplish . 
ask god repeat 
miraculous creation mother son , leave ?
