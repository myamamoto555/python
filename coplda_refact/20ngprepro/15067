whether use known plaintext attack ? 
dictionary attack . 
attack make sense . 
mean whoever encrypt file type password 
single dictionary word , russell try 
word dictionary . 
implausible , especially

first block decrypt obviously 
either . 
assume one attempt second , take seven hour try 
word . 
real tough . 
want des secure , use random keys .
