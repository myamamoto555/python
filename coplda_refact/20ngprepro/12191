okay , think agree singles hitter take 
strike two try get base way . 
`` '' guy excuse . 
`` '' guy right thing . 
`` '' guy could leave big cat ? 
. 
would guy better slugging percentage take 
pitch ? 
perhaps , doubt . 
tell joe carter 
go take pitch , draw walk , 
also hit many frozen rope bleacher 
likely hold back pitch use drive . 
`` '' guy ? 
joe morgan small strike zone 
rickey henderson `` strike zone size hitler 's heart '' 
get walk base small zone . 
look 5 guy : thomas , bonds , mcgwire , ruth williams . 
wow ! 
lot pitcher would rather nibble corner maybe 
walk guy throw clear strike . 
pitcher would better opinion come 
good fastball strike first pitch , pitcher 
would rather nibble , go 2-0 3-1 get hurt .
