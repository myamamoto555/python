one candidate suggest key registration 
body aclu . 
think poor choice . 
aclu 
essentially group auditor : audit people 's civil 
liberty administer . 
traditionally , auditor like get 
involve design operational aspect thing , good 
reason . 
system programmer , always infuriate 
auditor would come tell implementation stunk 
security point view , would tell fix . 
always 
figure like , without work help fix 
problem . 
take stint auditor , find real reason . 
auditor like recommend solution , put 
bad position criticize implementation later . 

say , `` well , tell way would ok . '' 

compromise independence necessary part auditor 's 
job . 
take case hand , suppose aclu become key half registrar . 
suppose , perhaps error aclu 's part , key half get 
away , use deprive someone civil 
liberty . 
aclu get wind , want take court . 
end time side defendant 
plaintiff , easy position . 
exception complete independence auditor : one 
place work , payroll check print , sign 
automatically signature drum burst machine . 
drum 
keep auditor also keep check stock , 
bring datum processing time check . 
believe difference situation key registration 
situation fairly obvious time payroll 
check : yesterday , someone want 
today , better able produce yesterday 's check 
destroy . 
determine many request key half 
legit trickier process , one much prone mistake could 
put aclu versus 
conflict interest . 
always , opinion .
