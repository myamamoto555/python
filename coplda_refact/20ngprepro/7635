sound wonderful , seem one either want spend time 
, power . 
example , would like 
see architecture like : 
.2 d 
.3 d 



app 
however , almost overkill . 
something like would probably 
make everyone lot happier : 




would nice see specialized group devote 2d , 3d , morph , 
, image processing , interactive graphic , toolkit , language , 
object system , etc. could post relevant group 
mailing list organize . 
way someone read news see subject 
heading , rather disparate : 
system specific stuff . 
??? 
. 
programmer : 
`` need help programming gl '' 
`` programming information ? '' 
`` fast sprite pc '' 
hardware technical stuff : 
`` speed '' 
`` driver 24x '' 
application orient stuff : 
`` 3.0 help '' 
`` good ? '' 
`` best image processing program amiga '' 
program orient stuff : 
`` fast polygon routine need '' 
`` good morphing want '' 
`` best depth sort triangle ? '' 
`` c + + library get ? '' 
wish someone power would get cfd go 
stuff ... newsgroup need .
