break cipher ? 
cipher , ciphertext something like 
plaintext xor , call cipher . 
key long plaintext english , 
follow : 
1 . 
discover length key count coincidence . 
see gaines , . 
try displacement 
ciphertext , count byte equal . 
two ciphertext portion use key , something 
6 % byte equal . 
use different 
key , less 0.4 % equal assume random 8-bit byte 
key cover normal ascii text . 
smallest displacement 
indicate equal key length repeat key . 
2 . 
shift text length xor . 

remove key leave text . 
since 
english 1 bit real information per byte , 2 stream 
text together 2 bit info per 8-bit byte , provide 
plenty redundancy choose unique decryption . 
fact 
one stream text 1 bit per byte . 
key short , might even easier treat 
standard polyalphabetic substitution . 
old cryptanalysis 
text show break . 
possible method , 
hand expert , ten time much text key . 
see , example , gaines , . 
send encrypted mail unix ? 
pgp , , pem , ... 
one popular method , use des command : 
cat file | compress | des | | mail 
meanwhile , de jure internet standard work call 
pem privacy enhance mail . 
describe rfc 1421 
1424 . 
join pem mailing list , contact . 
beta version pem test time 
write . 
also two program available public domain encrypt 
mail : pgp .

well . 
pgp commonly use outside usa since use rsa algorithm 
without license rsa 's patent valid least primarily 
usa . 
commonly use inside usa since use 
freely available within usa available shipment outside 
usa . 
since program use secret key algorithm encrypt body 
message pgp use idea ; use des rsa encrypt 
message key , able interoperate freely . 
although 
repeat call understand 's format 
algorithm choice , interoperation available time far 
know . 
unix crypt command secure ? 
. 
see . 
program available call cbw crypt 
breaker 's workbench use attack 
file encrypt crypt . 
one source cbw . 
use compression encryption ? 
number people propose perfect compression follow 
simple encryption method e.g. , xor repeat key . 
unfortunately , compress perfectly know exact 
distribution possible input . 
practical purpose 
impossible describe `` typical english text '' beyond coarse 
characteristic single-letter frequency . 
build 
sophisticated model input , enemy 
slightly accurate model , 'll able find 
redundancy compress output . 
note nearly practical compression scheme , unless 
design cryptography mind , produce output 
actually start high redundancy . 
example , output 
unix compress begin well-known `` magic number '' 
serve enter wedge cryptanalysis . 
say compression encryption inherently 
bad idea ; , carefully , means 
remove need strong encryption . 
compression encryption silly . 
unbreakable cipher ? 
yes . 
one-time pad unbreakable ; see part 4 . 
unfortunately 
one-time pad require secure distribution much key material 
plaintext . 
course , cryptosystem need utterly unbreakable 
useful . 
rather , need strong enough resist attack 
likely enemy whatever length time datum protect 
expect remain valid . 
`` random '' mean cryptography ? 
cryptographic application demand much pseudorandom 
number generator application . 
source bit 
cryptographically random , must computationally impossible 
predict nth random bit give complete knowledge 
algorithm hardware generate stream sequence 
0th bit , n lifetime source . 
software generator also know pseudo-random function 
expand truly random seed longer string apparently 
random bit . 
seed must large enough guess 
opponent . 
ideally , also truly random perhaps 
generate hardware random number source . 
sparcstation 1 workstation could , example , 
generate random number use audio input device source 
entropy , connect anything . 
example , 
cat | compress - > foo 
give file high entropy random much randomness 
. 
one encrypt file use part key , 
example , convert seed entropy pseudo-random 
string . 
look hardware device provide entropy , 
important really measure entropy rather assume 
look complicate human , must `` random '' . 

example , disk operation completion time sound like might 
unpredictable many people spinning disk much like 
clock output completion time relatively low entropy . 
unicity point a.k.a. unicity distance ? 
see . 
unicity distance approximation amount 
ciphertext sum real information entropy 
corresponding source text encryption key equal number 
ciphertext bit use . 
ciphertext significantly longer 
show probably unique decipherment . 
use 
back claim validity cryptanalysis . 
ciphertext significantly shorter likely 
multiple , equally valid decryption therefore gain security 
opponent 's difficulty choose correct one . 
unicity distance , like statistical information-theoretic 
measure , make deterministic prediction rather give 
probabilistic result : namely , minimum amount ciphertext 
likely single intelligible 
plaintext correspond ciphertext , possible key 
try decryption . 
work cryptologist normally 
deal unicity distance . 
instead directly determine 
likelihood event interest . 
let unicity distance cipher d character . 
fewer 
d ciphertext character intercept , 
enough information distinguish real key set 
possible key . 
des unicity distance 17.5 character , 
less 3 ciphertext block block correspond 
8 ascii character . 
may seem alarmingly low first , 
unicity distance give indication computational work 
require find key approximately d character 
intercept . 
fact , actual cryptanalysis seldom proceed along line use 
discuss unicity distance . 
like measure key 
size , unicity distance something guarantee insecurity 
small , guarantee security high . 

practical cryptosystem absolutely impervious analysis ; 
manner characteristic might serve enter `` wedge '' crack 
cipher message . 
however , similar information-theoretic 
consideration occasionally useful , example , determine 
recommend key change interval particular cryptosystem . 
cryptanalyst also employ variety statistical 
information-theoretic test help guide analysis 
promising direction . 
unfortunately , literature application information 
statistics cryptanalysis remain classified , even seminal 
1940 work alan turing see . 
insight 
possibility , see . 
key management important ? 
one fundamental axiom cryptography enemy 
full possession detail general cryptographic system , 
lack specific key datum employ encryption . 

course , one would assume cia make habit tell 
mossad cryptosystem , mossad probably find anyway . 
repeat use finite amount key provide redundancy 
eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress . 
thus , especially 
modern communication system vast amount information 
transfer , party must sound cryptosystem 
also enough key material cover traffic . 
key management refer distribution , authentication , 
handling key . 
publicly accessible example modern key management technology 
stu iii secure telephone unit , classify use 
employ individual code `` crypto ignition keys '' central key 
management center operate nsa . 
hierarchy 
certain cik use authorize cryptographic control 
personnel validate issuance individual traffic key 
perform function , 
reporting lose cik . 
give inkling extent key management 
problem . 
public-key system , several related issue , 
many `` trust ? '' 
use pseudo-random chaotic number key stream ? 
chaotic equation fractal produce apparent randomness 
relatively compact generator . 
perhaps simplest example 
linear sequence , one popular type random 
number generator , obvious dependence seed 
output . 
unfortunately graph sequence , 
high enough dimension , show regular lattice . 
mathematically 
lattice correspond structure notoriously easy 
cryptanalyst exploit . 
complicated generator 
complicated structure , make interesting picture -- 
cryptographically strong sequence computable 
structure . 
see , exercise ; ; . 
correct frequency list english letter ? 
three answer question , slightly deeper 
one . 
find first answer various book : 
namely , frequency list compute directly certain sample 
english text . 
course list `` correctly '' compute , 
exactly list get depend sample take . 
second answer question make sense . 

mean `` english letter '' ? 
`` english language '' 
fix , finite , close object exactly characterize . 

change time ; different different author . 
particular message different statistics 
language whole . 
third answer yes , particular message go 
exactly characteristic english general , 
reasonable statistical use slight discrepancy matter . 
fact entire field call `` bayesian statistics '' 
buzzword `` maximum entropy method '' `` maximum likelihood 
estimation '' study question like `` chance 
text letter frequency english ? '' 
come 
reasonably robust answer . 
make list sample english text . 

good enough practical work , use properly . 
enigma ? 
`` project datum security look source 
information german enigma code break 
british wwii . '' 
see , , , , . 
shuffle card ? 
card shuffling special case permutation array 
value , use random pseudo-random function . 
possible output 
permutation process equally likely . 
, 
need random function x produce uniformly 
distribute random integer interval . 
give 
function , shuffle follow c code : assume 
length array arr swap interchange value two 
address give 
n ; n > 0 ; n -- swap & arr n +1 , & arr n ; 
x achieve exactly simple % x since 
's interval may divisible x , although case 
error small . 
cover case , one take 's 
modulus mod x , call number y , return value less 
y , go back get another value . 
foil pirate encrypt cd-rom ? 
someone frequently express desire publish cd-rom 
possibly multiple piece software , perhaps encrypted 
separately , want use different key user perhaps 
even good limited period time order avoid piracy . 
far know , impossible , since nothing standard 
pc workstation hardware uniquely identify user 
keyboard . 
identification , cd-rom could 
encrypt key base part one sell user 
part unique identifier . 
however , case cd-rom one 
kind defeat intended purpose . 
cd-rom encrypt mass produce , must 
key set key encryption produce stage 
process . 
key useable copy cd-rom 's datum . 
pirate need isolate key sell along 
illegal copy .
