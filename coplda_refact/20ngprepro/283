's question . 
seem would 
electrical circuit hook neutral jumper 
neutral ground screw new ` three prong ' ground 
outlet . 
wrong reasoning ? 
> first , go local hardware store pick copy `` wiring 
> simplify '' h.l. richter . 
house wire metal 
> conduit , need seperate ground wire assume house 
> wire correctly pipe connect cold water 
> pipe basement . 
outlet neutral hooked 
> ground screw seem wrong . 
anyone else think ? 
back 70 's service technician cash register company . 
cash register use microprocessor circuit back 
susceptible electrostatic discharge line noise . 
biggest 
problem come outlet properly ground . 
almost every place go installation , find outlet 
ground connect neutral . 
99.9 % thing 
plug one , work fine . 
cash register 
nightmare -- line noise tend scramble memory 
periodically . 
modern electronics use switch power supplies 
less problem . 
even company use work longer 
recommend dedicated line seperate ground 
equipment . 
imagine check household wiring find 
ground neutral connect . 
although ideal , 
o.k. application .
