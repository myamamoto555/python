tube quality ?

rear tire . 
best metric match ? 
local bmw dealer think 
h 18 front h 18 back . 
also happen 
good get close match mail order price . 
thinking go metzler laser possibly comp k 
front back , mb variety possible longer 
last belting system . 
already use vision 
fj front , like , think shaft drive 
behavior torque guzzi might give predictable 
back end control slide behavior might , well give 
much better tire life .

runner modern update , historically exactly 
accurate still reflect relatively well representation cafe ' 
style .
