raid 5 model gen 4 90 . 
think may 
limitation channel customer need 
exceed speed since older model faster . 
also 
idle must work newer product might faster 
small company might able ask custom interface . 

still market older , faster model ago . 
maximum strategy , inc. . 
801 buckeye court

keep bus fully work time - sustained throughput 
might come close maximum burst rate . 
interesting problem .
