via .

template resource . 
correct 
resource , would grateful receive . 
way , could play around 
bit maybe get duo something useful serial port . 
appletalk . 
btw , believe port stats say maximum buffer 
byte , mean increase buffer help , 
use hardware handshaking . 
cram text datum pretty fast duo , 
monitor cts lower , buffer never get beyond 
4096 byte . 
make sense .
