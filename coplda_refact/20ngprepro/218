herein lie key thread : 
kindly note difference response . 
ed talk 
know ride technique , mike argue know physics 
behind . 
possible teach technique countersteering 
ie : push bar inside turn go way without 
learn gyroscope ice cream cone 
see parallel thread . 
stuff mainly interest 
geek like reader ; ^ , 
need teach average student learn . 
mike seem able make distinction . 
know people 
carve circle around could tell newton . 
hand , know intelligent , well-educated people 
think steer motorcycle either : 1 lean , 2 steer 
la bicycle , 3 combination 1 2 . 
knowledge physics 
get squat - knowledge technique !
