p h p hg + p hg ' g ' complement g

sense , hg necessarily `` complicate '' h h g , 
may splitting hair , try say irrespective 
subjective impression complicated something , p h > p hg

well , `` p x | p x | b '' mean x likely observe 
operative b operative . 
imply observe x 
provide useful information might allow discriminate 
respective possibility b operative ; difference 
reduce difference unknown unhelpful prior 
probability p p b : 
p x | p x | b > 
p | x k p , p b | x k p b 
k p x | p x p x | b p x . 
b `` equally consistent datum '' observe x 
give pointer b operative . 
particular case h b hg , however , know 
prior probability order p h > p hg , although know 
actual value , allow deploy razor

always determine whether equality `` p x | h 
> p x | hg '' true . 
certainly true , particular point whether 
` divine component ' actually underlie prevalence religion 
addition memetic transmission component , even religious 
implicitly acknowledge operative talk ` spread word ' . 
seem , say , observe variance religious 
belief well account memetic transmission model , rather 
less well one propose ` divine component ' addition , since would 
expect latter conspire wide variance even mutual 
exclusion among belief . 
thus personal feeling p x | hg 
even equal p x | h case , smaller h memetic transmission , 
g ` divine component ' , x variance among belief . 
happily 
acknowledge subjective impression .

need , analogy , know

multiplier two-headed coin hypothesis greater unity . 
need know initial value run estimate

clear large number observation , p

observation like ; really matter , affect 
reasoning , provide possible observation 
would count `` appearance '' . 
example might 
demonstration efficacy prayer , veracity 
revelation . 
statement p x | h general x still count 
prediction h. theism question , ht , say prayer may

p x | ht > 0 x. distinguish atheist

ok , 'll downgrade '' interact '' '' may interact '' , would 
actually better since `` interact '' imply falsifiability 
agree misplace .

'll explain , bear mind central ; require 
theism make prediction `` appearance 
never happen '' , atheism . 
somebody point quantum 
mechanic make prediction either , difference 
qm atheism form partition . 
prediction include statement `` prayer efficacious '' imply 
`` stats , find prayer efficacious '' , `` prayer 
efficacious '' , `` verily say unto , generation shall 
pass , till thing fulfil . '' 
think problem 
misunderstanding . 
persistent observation stuff happen , consistent 
ht though may , consistent ha , explain 
bayesian stats post . 

even ht `` god exist '' unfalsifiable ,

fine ; claim theism false , merely finite 
number observation available far suggest , 
continue observe , suggestion look better better . 
> renormalization stuff delete 
bayesian stats post , assume theism indeed unfalsifiable 
finite number observation . 
relevant quote : 

$ important assumption observation 
$ compatible theist hypothesis atheist 
$ hypothesis , thus would falsify atheism ; call 
$ ` appearance ' , need take literally . 

$ observation require explanation one god 
$ exist count . 
observation assume compatible 
$ hypothesis . 
leave theism unfalsifiable , atheism 
$ falsifiable single observation ` appearance 
$ ' .

could wrong statment - ... 
think ; `` appearance '' sufficient falsify 
atheism , whereas general corresponding theism unfalsifiable .

, general question .

x also unfalsifiable ? 
: way counterexample , let x `` coin fair '' , 
accurately x make sense `` two side coin 
different '' . 
unfalsifiable toss coin ; even string 
head consistent fair coin , go infinite 
number toss falsify x limit . 
converse falsifiable , 
falsify least one head least one tail appear .

, although falsifiable finite number observation .

might miss something . 
`` rapture happen october 28 1992 . '' 
said rapture would 
falsified atheism satisfaction happen , although failure 
happen , course , falsify theism 
specifically predict . 
`` phenomenon require existence one god 
explanation ever observe . '' 
sum whole thing .
