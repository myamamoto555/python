professor mine say `` difference computer engineer 
computer scientist $ 5000 '' mean engineer make $ 5000 
cs . 
seriously though main difference cs people write program 
people use , i.e. database , graphic , word processor , etc. , 
engineer write machine control system , i.e. `` computer '' 
car , flight control system , computer controle device , etc. . 
word 
cs write software cse write firmware . 
generalization part difference .
