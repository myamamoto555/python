major league baseball try expand appeal people shorter 
attention span i.e. football crowd . 
- : invariably , 
argument people like watch baseball t.v. say 
thing : game long boring . 
baseball try 
find way shorten game wider t.v. appeal . 
look 
, though , baseball game last around amount time football 
game . 
difference `` action '' duration 
football game . 
perhaps `` action '' baseball game , 
would get fan tune . 
anyway , come solution 
make baseball appealing bigger crowd go difficult . 
soapbox yet another reason get commisioner since obvious 
ruling baseball comittee work fast snail race 
nebraska . 
soapbox
