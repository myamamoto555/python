battery expert , recent reading , lead acid battery 
self discharge relatively high rate , store discharge 
state , develop condition think call sulfation . 
storage , 
either electrolyte remove replace use fat chance 
would ever home , battery store trickle 
charge . 
also think read condition may 
hook current limited charge circuit fro long period time . 
remember use c amp hour 
charge circuit , leave hook week . 
may 
apply gel type cell , suspect apply liquid 
type .
