> hear frequently - exactly pascal 's wager ? 
pascal 's wager go something like : 
premise # 1 : either god . 
premise # 2 : god exist , want believe damn 
believe . 
premise # 3 : god exist , belief god matter 
death death , anyway . 
conclusion : belief god superior 
damn eternal punishment wrong , belief 
god waste little time life wrong . 
sound pretty straightforward logically sound . 
problem , 
premise # 1 presuppose 1:1 odds belief . 

flat wrong , sheer number religion 
fact , part , religion mutually exclusive . 

hear theist refer `` 99 % atheist '' believe 
god god _ one _ god set god . 
consequence 
`` pick wrong god ? '' 
suddenly , odds look 
good pick wrong god wrong doctrine god still 
leave possibility wrong damned another 
god 's version hell . 
sound `` break '' ?
