try prozac month ago , insomnia , 
anxiety jitters . 
probably could live insomnia 
prozac good , provide tiny benefit . 
maybe 
person prescribe know much give 
dose work . 
see psychiatrist put zoloft another serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor like prozac . 
one seem help . 
try . 
zoloft fewer milder side effect 
prozac . 
think doctor say 4 % people take zoloft 
discontinue side effect . 
problem 
minor gi distress , nothing annoying . 
hopefully 
zoloft work . 
maybe friend try one next . 
psychiatrist 's strategy seem first try one serotonin 
drug , usually prozac . 
work , great . 
work many 
side effect , try zoloft maybe paxil . 
serotonin drug work 
, try one tricyclic like desipramine . 
> ... suggestion next step ? 
doctor know something antidepressant make big 
difference . 
psychiatrist claim gp fp much 
experience area , see inclined believe 
. 
think know antidepressant people 
family practitioner 's office . 
disclaimer : doctor ; know come talk 
psychiatrist reading .
