'll tell story example . 
early 1984 take ride lesson college roommate 
old honda . 
take msf beginner 's course , 
actually learn need know ride . 
proceed buy beat-up honda $ 400 $ 12 helmet 
ride around wear cotton windbreaker . 
decide 
invest full-face helmet first smart move . 
sometime around 
also pass road test . 
may 4 , 1984 , get catch rainstorm way home 
4-mile trip . 
enter town live rather urban suburb , 
stop suddenly red light notice late , 
skid rear tire , eject face upward 
lane traffic . 
fortunately oncoming traffic 
also stop red light , otherwise might slide 
car kill . 
anecdotal evidence , sure , later take 
experience rider course msf see earlier training 
could help greatly . 
case need even greater 
since nobody help practice even basic stuff 
. 
advice take msf beginner 's course first thing . 

would even buy bike take course , unless 
happen pick real good deal store someplace 
ready use .

wait take course might take week 
dc , recall always wait list boston , could 
save money start right ? 
say $ 300 ride gear , 
plus cost bike , plus maybe $ 100 guess mechanic make sure 
machine safe assume economize buy old beat-up 
machine private individual , plus insurance , plus registration 
licensing fee , plus course , look maybe $ 600 
include bike reserve ongoing maintenance .

turn 18

> till , need comprehensive list cost buy 
> motorcycle go insure live washington dc make 
> difference 
pay $ 100 insurance upstate ny closer $ 200 
boston urban decent insurance include substantial 
coverage liability , want unless plan always 
poor . 
would guess dc like boston like rural area , ergo 
expensive . 
> 3 recommendation look ? 
use annual buyer 's guide usual motorcycle 
magazine ; find helpful get idea new 
recent model might available . 
could probably look 
past issue size use bike might available . 
first 
bike 13 year old buy go friend 's advice 
instead . 
also look bike see people ride 
park street . 
basically settle present bike 
notice lot bmw 's run around 
generally set way want . 
nothing wrong talk various dealer area visit 
showroom . 
dealer boston area , least shop , 
nice let look around showroom 
quote price bike latest model hence 
cheaper , although end buy bike private sale .
