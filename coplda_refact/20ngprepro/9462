opinion stupidest thing hidden game . 

argument 
1 defense , run allow , 50 % game . 
2 unearned run amount 12 % run allow ; earn run , 88 % . 
3 since unearned run result fielding , pitch , 
earn run product pitching , fielding , fielding 12 % 
defense pitching 88 % defense . 
4 # 1 , pitch 44 % game , field 6 % . 
pete usually sharper . 
feel fielding 
% defense range ; call 30-70 fielding 
pitch . 
> one also separate offense batting baserunning , 
> split probably somewhere around 49.5 % 0.5 % . 
would give baserunning little credit , maybe 45-5 , 
even 40-10 . 
give team roberto alomar team john 
identical batting stats would unreasonable , 
even let roberto steal single base , 'll score lot
