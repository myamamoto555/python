flight fancy , irrational approach , common . 
crucial 
thing sit around fantasy ; use 
unless make experiment . 
know lot scientist 
whose fantasy lead creative work ; usually admit 
loud fantasy , prior consumption beer . 
simple example : warren jelinek notice extremely heavy band dna 
electrophoresis gel human alu fragment . 
get excited , hope 
would see essential part control mechanism eukaryotic 
gene . 
fantasy lead sequence sample band carry 
binding assay . 
result , 400 bp , sequence 
occur 500,000 time human genome . 
unfortunately 
warren 's fantasy , turn transposon present 
many copy replicate copy back 
genome . 
hand , characteristic transposon 
much elucidate ; necessity cellular reverse transcriptase 
recognize ; standard method recognize human dna create . 
species different set transposon . 
fortunately , 
warren use eat dinner t.g.i. fridays time .

sure random . 
known rational mechanism 
generate rich set interesting hypothesis . 
really 
work unknown area , unlikely much sense 
might might true ; circumstance , best 
thing follow whatever instinct . 
wrong , 
find soon enough ; least , find _ something _ . 
try experiment random , prior conception 
mind , probably get nowhere .

unfortunately , critical function sometimes become hostage 
non-rational force . 
get variety pathological science : 
lysenko , mirsky 's opposition , cold fusion , forth .

agree follow . 
fact , _ exactly _ point 
disagree feyerabend . 
important part 
culture science one keep one 's jealousy refereeing 
process . 
failure aplenty , , whole , thing work . 
another point : couple sens phrase `` experimental 
design '' . 
would say less rational part experimental _ choice _ , 
design . 
alexander fleming proc . 
royal , 1922 choose look 
bacteriophage mucus strange reason phage previously 
find locust diarrhea ; fleming probably think runny bottom , runny 
nose , hell , worth try . 
method look phage 
well-designed detect anything ; fact , find lysozyme .

clear mean rational v. irrational . 
perhaps 
give example surprising experiment try 
perfectly rational reason , interesting new theory first 
advance logical grounds . 
main example think 
modern high-energy physics typical science whole .
