nuclear weapon dangerous . 
radioactive 
decay plutonium uranium , well tritium 
weapon , tend somewhat dangerous live thing .

think 75 % ? 
whatever neutron hit good chance absorb 
neutron become radioactive . 
mostly , mean water 
turn harmless heavy water . 
neutron would 
also hit bone , result , radioactive 
would remain body decade . 
think unshielded nuclear 
warhead could reasonably consider public health hazard . 
shield warhead , think fair amount 
require remain safely shield e.g. storage 
dry , facility , etc. . 
. 
private 
ownership unregulated , think single individual must 
able keep weapon , keep safe 
condition . 
random private citizen could properly 
keep , maintain store nuclear weapon , regulation 
clearly appropriate . 
plus thing self - 
defense purpose . 
kinda hard justify use 
militia weapon best mean battlefield use 
low-yield weapon worst industrial target obliteration 
translation : city population center . 
> militia job overthrow illegal 
> government , indeed useful weapon militia . 
disagree purpose : job militia defend 
community . 
look american 
revolution example , militia win seperate 
, become independent , repressive government . 

overthrow , community canada england , 
example defend still 
old regime . 
role militia offensive , go 
destroy repressive government , nuclear weapon _ might _ appropriate . 
job defensive , nuclear weapon suit 
. 
also question personal collective arm : 
second amendment definately protect ownership personal 
weapon since nature militia require member 
provide arm . 
clear cover 
arm . 
certainly , member would supply example 
tank , could use effectively 
. 
however , provide heavy weapon 
disproportionate control militia . 
militia , framer envision , extremely 
democratic : 50 % member support cause , 
50 % would respond muster , militia 's firepower would 
proportionately reduce . 
militia firepower popular 
, therefore , link . 
small minority 
member supply large fraction firepower 
form heavy weapon would change : militia 's 
firepower would depend small minority , 
general public . 
worse , minority would quite 
different general public least , 
would much richer . 
result , think nature 
character militia require member provide 
roughly equal share militia 's firepower : personal 
weapon , equitable fraction squad 's heavier firepower .
