seem hell eternal death god . 
course , popular conception hell correct incorrect 
something akin eternal perpetuation consciousness , least .

> see god -- , fact , believe go hell . 
think good number atheist believe nothing beyond 
bodily death , simply abuse language say believe 
go hell . 
believe go _ die _ . 
understand 
turn hell verb . 
use logic , also follow 
animal ` go hell . ' 
sure want 
say ? 
presumably animal opportunity get heaven , 
still change fact go hell die 
final death 
claim know whether afterlife _ _ 
sort , hell describe final death , 
eternal perpetuation consciousness true 
never moment aware non-existence . 
assume ` go hell ' heaven word , ` ll 
never know dead . 
hmmm ... 
> hell worse earth hell -- eternal , 
ever hear people say loved one ill , die : 
`` least suffer ; heaven . '' 
? 
consider follow statement : 
`` least suffer ; hell . '' 
statement sound odd , accord definition hell , 
would true statement . 
person hell would suffer . 
grant , would anything would 
conscious experience whatsoever . 
say hell death eternal . 
however , lose meaning 
dead person . 
, seem threat sort 
eternal punishment make force one expect 
conscious throughout eternity . 
many atheist believe thirst afterlife simply 
product propaganda `` friend , want free gift life ? '' 
understanding early jew believe afterlife . 
anyone back ? 
combine survival instinct 
animal share . 
difference consciousness , get 
idea eternal life drill brain , desire sort 
. 
> lot worse heaven . 
comparison matter . 
would depend heaven like . 
god king , 
eternity heaven consist give thanks praise king , 
might opt hell .
