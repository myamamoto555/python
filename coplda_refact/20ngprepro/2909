certainly exception . 
write paper include 
sufficiently detail information build nuclear weapon , 
classify . 
understand law , nuclear weapon design 
_ automatically _ classify even work . 
believe 
allow read paper . 
less serious example : tell driver speed trap

break law discover location policeman .

reverse engineering clipper chip . 
tell think violate constitution -- find 
court case strike law .
