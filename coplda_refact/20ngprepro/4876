flight sequence c8 active , spacecraft subsystem instrument 
payload perform well array normal spin outer cruise 
configuration , uplink downlink via high gain antenna ; uplink 
125 bp , downlink 2 k engineering datum rate . 
result spacecraft enter contingency mode april 9 , 
payload instrument automatically power on-board fault 
protection software . 
gamma ray spectrometer random access memory 
successfully reload monday , april 19 . 
prepare 
magnetometer calibration reschedule execution flight 
sequence c9 tuesday wednesday next week , reload payload 
data system random access memory take place morning 
begin 10:30 . 
weekend , flight team send real-time command 
perform differential one-way ranging obtain additional datum 
analysis navigation team . 
radio science ultra stable oscillator 
testing take place monday . 
flight sequence c9 uplink occur sunday , april 25 , 
activation midnight , monday evening april 26 . 
c9 modify 
include magnetometer calibration could perform c8 due 
contingency mode entry april 9 . 
magnetometer instrument 
calibration allow instrument team better characterize 
magnetic field effect instrument . 
information critical martian magnetic field measurement 
occur approach mapping phase . 
mag cal require 
sequence command spacecraft array normal spin state 
perform slew roll maneuver provide mag team datum point 
vary spacecraft attitude orientation . 
today , spacecraft km mi .
