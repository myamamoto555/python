whatever auto transmission . 
normal manual transmission 
gearbox clutch , servo motor ,

minimal mechanical friction , transmission 
ferrari , williams , mclaren ?

however , transmission share important disadvantage 
stock : expensive . 
long gearbox available 
` normal ' car gon na stick manual .

loss mileage power except maybe real heavy traffic . 

drive mostly autobahn country road anyway .
