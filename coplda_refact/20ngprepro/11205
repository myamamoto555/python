package pc vga graphic . 
currently work realtime application run pcc 
kernel need simple graphic . 
sure 
graphic library go issue . 
suspect 'll implement display controller server process 
handle graphic request , queue mailbox , one time . 

provide sufficiently frequent display update believe 
restrict graphic operation perform server thus 
constrain access library single process avoid need 
reentrant graphic library . 
fairly new realtime system world may overlook something , 
think ? 
cheers ,
