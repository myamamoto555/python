come destruction jerusalem would understand 
people time full frontal assault understanding 
relationship lord . 
today general populace 
hear `` prophesy '' like portland earthquake new york burn 
one , unlikely see context relationship 
lack lord . 
far likely think 
result fevered imagination religious nutter . 
one reason always deep ; y suspicious bald judgement 
prophesy without explanation reason judgement . 

long winded . 
see relatively modern example look 
abraham lincoln 's second inaugural speech .

fondly hope - fervently pray - mighty 
scourge war may speedily pass away .

wealth pile 's two hundred fifty year 
unrequited toil shall sink , every drop blood draw 
lash shall pay another draw sword , say three 
thousand year ago , still must say `` judgment lord ,

malice toward none ; charity ; firmness right , 
god give see right , let strive finish work 
; bind nation 's wound ; care shall 
bear battle , widow , orphan -
