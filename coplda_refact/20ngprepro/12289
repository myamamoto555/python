justify want . 
extend warranty ripoff , high profit item 
dealer . 
buy , get free , 
buy . 
still pay $ 50 every time use 
great ` warranty ' . 
better put money bank use repair 
need . 
consider last car 1.5 year old , 
sure even keep new one past free warranty period ? 
btw , typical profit extended warranty around 80 % . 
right , 
20 % money need go collective pot pay future 
repair group collect .
