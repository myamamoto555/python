discussion purpose , ignore dynamic effect like pulse 
exhaust pipe , try paint useful mental picture . 
1 . 
unless engine supercharged , pressure available force 
air intake tract _ atmospheric _ . 
time intake 
valve open , pressure differential available move air 
difference combustion chamber pressure leave 
exhaust stroke atmospheric . 
piston 
intake stroke , combustion chamber pressure decrease , allow 
atmospheric pressure move air intake tract . 
time 
pressure ever become `` negative '' , even approach good 
vacuum . 
2 . 
time exhaust valve closing , pressure 
combustion chamber essentially pressure exhaust system 
first major flow restriction muffler . 
note volume 
gas must flow exhaust much larger volume 
must flow intake , temperature 
difference product combustion . 
3 . 
last 6-8 year , japanese manufacturer start 
pay attention exhaust intake tuning , pursuit almighty 
horsepower . 
point time , high-performance bike , 
substitution aftermarket free-flow air filter almost 
zero affect performance , stock intake system flow 
well anyway . 
substitution aftermarket exhaust system make 
little difference , unless general new exhaust system 
_ much _ louder stocker . 
4 . 
older bike , exhaust dominate factor . 
free-flowing air filter substitute , little difference 
note , unless free-flowing exhaust system install well . 
5 . 
general , engine visualize air pump . 

give rpm , anything cause engine pump air , 
intake exhaust side , cause produce horsepower . 
pump air require recalibration carburetor .
