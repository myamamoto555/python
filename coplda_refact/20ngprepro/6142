sure miss implication could another 
richard nixon type president future perhaps distant 
future , . 
mind , take also would 
object gov come decision proposal - 
like clinton cripple decision , proposal spring 
start place video camera sound every room house , 
could activate without knowlege . 
would well 
conceal would know location , prevent cover 
lens opening . 
, nothing would 
slightest interest government official , right ? 
, surely 
object proposal ... 
best , principle pretty close - ability 
eavesdrop activity little effort , without 
knowlege , protect entirely `` government safeguard '' . 

still draw curtain , still privacy everyone 
else except big brother !! 
need protection 
drug dealer terrorist criminal like ` enemy 
state ' ... really right `` unbreakable '' privacy 
anyway , sort press release clinton cripple decision 
put ... 
find curious use word `` unbreakable '' term really 
`` difficult break without proper authorization '' 
government certainly disposal , right ? 
would 
want able break illegally , would ? 
... , 
`` people '' clinton ... 
, mind , give one good reason 
algorithm secret algorithm , unless encryption scheme 
either joke , contain feature like ` master key ' back 
door unauthorized eavesdropping ? 
really even moderately 
secure , government really mean require proper court 
order key escrow account able decipher 
traffic , need keep algorithm secret ? 
seem 
hear rather often encryption scheme require algorithm 
remain secret effective , worthwhile scheme ... 
idle talk , administration everyone ? 
great skepticism , many doubt administration intention ... 
wait !! 
tell next gem administration 
mind e-mail datafile security . 
press release say 
part comprehensive thing datum security unprivileged 
citizen . 
perhaps ` subject ' would better term - ` citizen ' 
somehow seem appropriate ... imply free people , ` subject ' 
better fit population serve pleasure ruler . 
one thing certain : government longer regard citizen 
boss anymore , way around ...

without prejudice ucc pat myrto seattle , wa 
else fail , try : ... ! 

wisdom : `` two thing infinite ; universe human stupidity , 
sure former . ''
