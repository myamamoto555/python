plan post summary response soon work 
code , also include . 
intersection 3 plane method 
look best , implementation base short article 
graphics gem work . 
may misinterpret , course . 
avoid simultaneous solution plane equation favor 
dot cross product , former may actually better . 
either 
case matrix determinant need compute implicitly solution 
linear equation . 
get plane , take midpoint line , say , 
p1 p2 , set normal `` normalize '' vector p1 p2 . 
plug graphics gem . 
however , result 
center point occasionally equidistant 4 test point 
different test . 
math rusty , look like 
need verify , use simultaneous equation solution , 
require bring another routine easy 
find . 
another method first find center circle define 2 set 
3 point , intersect normal . 
would also define 
circle center . 
however , small numerical imprecision would make 
line intersect . 
supposedly 3 plane intersect unique 
point parallel .

thanks answer far .
