`` , , disk controller call device . 

device require exclusive interrupt ownership , eg . 
disk 
controller i6 keyboard i1 . 
also device 
require exclusive ownership , ie . 
share 
interrupt another device , eg . 
'' 

. 
standard isa bus , one almost pc use , 
two separate interface card share interrupt . 
due 
screwup bus design . 
example , soundblaster want 
drive interrupt number 7 , must hold certain bus wire 0 
1 time , depend whether want interrupt . 
preclude let another card assert interrupt number 7 . 

two device isa bus pc share interrupt , 
implement single card .

simple . 
first , andrew correct , although see might 
confusion . 
indeed possible two card configure use 
interrupt . 
share interrupt sense 
possible card active time . 
example . 
time , short `` free interrupt . '' 

tape controller `` floppy tape '' need one . 

old tape drive . 
solution use also use , 
modem . 
reason would never use modem 
tape simultaneously . 
kermit run , install interrupt 
handler use serial port . 
tape drive generate 
interrupt , kermit would clue tape 
controller . 
since tape controller would service , would 
likely `` hang . '' 
likewise , tape backup software run , 
install interrupt handler . 
handler anything 
serial port . 
dos , printing . 
instead , bios poll 
status parallel port determine another byte may send . 
sound card configure use . 
try nt see far 'll get .
