think anyone argue would effect . 

would _ net _ _ positive _ effect . 
also 
consider negative side : law abide citizen , arm 
pistol part , prevent 80,000 
national crime survey 1,000,000 dr. kleck crime 
year . 
extreme . 
study find 
number 500,000 600,000 . 
1 % crime 
homicide , private ownership firearm _ save _ approximately 
5,000 life year . 
roughly 12,000 criminal homicide 
fatal accident involve gun year . 

net benefit , would show gun control measure 
would disarm 40 % criminal currently use gun . 
would hard : accord federal batf , 
8 % criminal buy gun counter . 
since 
gun control law , nature , effect legal 
sale , law would remove benefit armed , 
law-abiding citizen minimal effect 
armed criminal , large , get gun illegally . 
sound like net benefit . 
> ... 250 > accidental < handgun 
> homicide america 1990 , licensed weapon . 
since licensed weapon , assume 
support `` reasonable '' law i.e. wait period , background 
check , , etc. . 
. 
. 
since complete ban would 
alter statistic refer , assume 
support . 
way , 1135 people die 1986 fall stair . 
250 accidental handgun death significant next 
household accident . 
> ... 
> american child accidentally shoot child last year 15 
> handgun homicide great britain . 
1080 child age 10 die drown , 69 
drink poisonous household chemical like drano , 139 
fall . 
real goal reduce tragic , accidental 
death child , would ban drain cleaner 
better palce start ? 
, perhaps , restrict ownership 
professional like plumber ? 
> ... please ... dictionary argument rate vs 
> total number , okay ? 
offer emphasis , comparison . 
might call `` emphasis '' , refer completely two 
statistics sentence _ imply _ comparison . 

valid , put number together convince people 
right , kindest thing could call propaganda .
