`` try true '' method utilize guerilla terrorist group : 
conduct operation midst local populace , thus force 
oppose `` state '' possible harm innocent civilian search , 
order avoid death civilian , abandon search . 
certainly 
people use population cover also drag 
innocent civilian harm 's way . 
suggest , guerilla use population cover , israel 
totally back ? 
... easiest way get away attack 
another use innocent shield hope respects 
innocent life ?

station country country allow

ask leave time ; nasser '56 
' 67 . 
somehow , `` limitation '' troops `` power '' 
think israel go comfortable . 
without genuine commitment peace arab state , concrete intellectual political exercise jargon `` guarantee '' party , un worthless 
israel , perhaps useful `` ruse '' ?

perhaps aware , community people , 
feeling better `` many die fight 
attack die silently 
accept fate . ''

israel 's perspective , `` concession '' get nothing ... except 
realization give `` something '' 
hope side decide likewise . 
word take 
back merely ; `` take back '' tangible item land , 
control land require sort action say israel 
stay away . 
israel put attack arab state territory decade 
essentially put stop invasion lebanon . 
entire basis reality exactly state : 1 israel 
would express outrage attack protest arab state 
involve , 2 state promptly ignore entire matter , secure 
knowledge could hold responsible act 
commit `` private group '' , 3 israel would prepare next 
round attack . 
would israel want return day 
idiotic suggest `` trust '' motivation 
present-day arab state ?

ah , ok ... `` different '' present situation tell 
arab state pursue past antagonistic 
policy towards israel ? 
, talk vague `` political factor '' 
`` tangible '' like israel give 
factor `` guarantee '' responsibility state . 

assessment `` difference '' base whole lot assumption , 
state feel confortable base existence 
sort thing .

without support , active involvement , syria , 
lebanon would able accomplish occur . 
syria leave say lebanon able retain 
control ?
