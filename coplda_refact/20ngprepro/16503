read post kirlian whatever spelling 
photography could help slightly disgust 
narrow-minded , `` know '' , `` believe see 
measure '' attitude many people . 
neither real believer , disbeliever come 
so-called `` paranormal '' stuff ; far concerned , 
likely existence , instance , god , seem 
quite accept society - without scientific basis . 
convince serious mistake close mind 
something , anything , simply fit current frame 
reference . 
history show many great people , great scientist , 
people keep open mind - ridicule sceptic . 
especially usa grateful ; , columbus 
drop edge earth . 
flame , end sermon : -
