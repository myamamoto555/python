secrecy clipper chip 
serial number clipper chip encrypt system key 
transmit one part three part message . 
presumably protocol recover nothing else , differential 
analysis . 
postulate , chip logic sit clipper chip 
communication channel . 
purpose chip twofold : 
1 transmit channel 
spoof chip xor 30 bit encrypted serial number 
secondary key variable . 
render serial number 
unrecoverable system key 
2 recieve channel 
spoof chip xor incoming encrypted serial number 
secondary key variable assume serial number 
necessary local operation . 
net result hide serial number . 
get 
interesting number serial number issue become large , 
make difficult distinguish valid serial number 
spoofed serial number . 
without know system key , could 
lie serial number , risk detection lie . 
system key encryption algorithm could 
successfully lie lower probability detection emulate 
format serial number . 
make wonder hide ? 
seem like secrecy 
prevent lie .
