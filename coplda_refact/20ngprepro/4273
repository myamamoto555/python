ok , read thread post $ 0.02 . 
would 
add phil 's discussion follow caveat : 
fifth amendment apply case . 
'' ... shall person . 
. 
. 
compel criminal case witness ... '' . 
thus father sue custody child , case would 
civil defendant mother would fifth amendment protection . 
oddly enough , refusal give information civil case lead 
criminal contempt charge thus land jail . 
interesting part 
murder trial , woman plead fifth 
location child -- routine . 
`` computer crime '' 
prosecution thus would seem fertile ground kind defense , 
suit party injure `` hacker '' would . 
accuse , 
example , send encrypted kiddie porn net fifth 
protect key . 
accuse send copyright material , however , 
copyright infringement `` crime '' 
technical sense . 
really tricky question , say naughty 
boy government use information gain civil 
trial ie . 
key gain access file use criminal 
prosecution . 
answer certainly , lord know 
would work .
