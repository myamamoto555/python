think hangup digital scope know much 
work basis , 
function typically present , opinion , 
counter-intuitive fashion hp make stride 
series , imo . 
automatic setup fine simple , 
repetitive waveform , give crazy result 
complex event need understand scope 
actually event . 
example , scope 
`` equivalent time '' `` real time '' sampling mode equivalent time 
mode sample built-up slowly add delay 
trigger event sweep ? 
scope 's actual sampling 
rate time ? 
datum massage capture 
display , etc. . 
one common misconception speed scope . 
hp scope use really 100 mhz scope ? 
20 mhz 
sample rate scope ~ 5 mhz single shot significance whose front 
end include support 100 mhz waveform important 
equivalent time sampling ? 
100 mhz input case really 
help waveform repetitive , single 
sample , get lucky hit transient event sample time . 
, lot variable understand get 
useful information digital scope . 
prefer analog scope 
general use digital event need storage 
later analysis comparison , event within capability 
scope . 
, price true 100 mhz digital scope 
fall ...
