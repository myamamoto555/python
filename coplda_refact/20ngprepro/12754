, far clear . 
word fbi 
survivor make claim . 
contradictory word lawyer 
speak survivor individually agree 
suicide pact intentionally start fire . 
absense 
evidence , see decide believe . 
furthermore , quite possible general suicide pact 
small inner circle take upon kill everyone else . 
state area , may never know happen .

good reason believe bd 's . 
agree assessment relative probability . 
likely 
bd 's start fire fbi . 
currently

nearly none .

d. fire start accidentally bd . 
truely amaze 
hear read one suggest possibility . 
tear gas lack power compound 
adult wear gas mask , chaotic inside . 
easily image someone leave lamp close something 
accidentally drop lamp knock one . 
wind , 
would quickly get control .

fire fbi

find latter

, think d also quite reasonable . 
personally really 
ass relative either 3 probability although 
force bet issue , would probably take accident either fbi 
bd setting fire . 
would also like add comment related report body recover 
gunshot wound . 
coroner today show morning categorically 
deny reach conclusion . 
point intense 
heat , sufficient pressure build head cause explode 
look much like massive gunshot wound head 
quite consist te report read hear . 
short , almost evidence corroborate many 
scenario happen monday . 
remain skeptical 
information available .
