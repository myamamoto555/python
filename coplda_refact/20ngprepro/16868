, frank o'dwyer , live dream world . 
wonder 
discussion leave statement . 
matter fact , think 
ignorant human nature . 
even one start something one 
believe , one get easily fool actually believe one say . 
# 
give benefit doubt , prove statement . 
onus proof , sunshine . 
make think 
theist leader believe say ? 
especially say 
one thing another , say one thing closely follow 
opposite ? 
practice restricted theism , 
anyone see . 
almost epidemic country . 
instance , harder camel pass thru ' eye 
needle , catholic church wealthy land-owner ? 

church square inch country ?

theism fanatic . 
however , rest already 
backup statement correlation

, specialty theistic belief allow 
switch easily . 
take nifty improvement

theism attraction gullible people 
correlation . 
whole discussion start way 
theism meaningfully correlate ,

quite well aware give everyone rights 
better fanatic way round . 
course , people always fanatic , never oneself . 

wish slur theist seem pretty fanatical .

unusually weak even . 
latter imply proof 
opinion . 
somehow accept 
accept pythagoras . 
wow , incredible insight . 
prove wrong opinion . 
possible 
system leave useful information respectively claim 
even absurd statement information . 
totally circular , totally useless . 
# 
wish believe make believe . 
thing judge appeal , 
information . 
make feel good believe 
good , contain zillion possible pitfall . 

despite contrary evidence bogus proof attempt . 
truth blatant assertion . 
see many bogus proof 
non-existence god existence . 
# 
system , way , mean every datum come 
analysis , point evaluation datum 
logic . 
easily follow system allow 
rational . 
yes , possible evaluate 
rational system rational fallacy 
, since validity axiom agree upon , 
impact possibility demon alum descartes . 
parse , sorry . 
# 
far matter consistency . 
use argument show 
system consistent . 
evaluation 
. 
need rationality . 
contradict , however .

evidence . 
trick choice axiomatic 
system difficult , possibility interweave . 
therefore choose least assumption assumption 
necessary get information system anyway . 
would like see alleged evidence . 
# 
need define axiom order define evaluation method 
usefulness , foundation lay one feel 
one feel . 
see . 
irrational belief . 
, fanatic never ,

would science . 
please 
subjective datum lend scientific treatment well . 
prohibit formulate objective statement . 
ergo , nothing objective . 
fair enough .

neighbor 
little . 
time exactly happen . 
nope , fallacy . 
go correlation 
wish see . 
# 
tell , irrelevant , statement 
holy books ? 
please note one could 
relevant anymore . 
god err ? 
say message ? 
excuse - holy books ? 
# 
come theist say genocide order god ok . 
god 
easiest way excuse anything , therefore highly attract 
. 
mention effect interpretation fanatic 
rest believer . 
happen . 
god neither easiest way excuse anything , way .
