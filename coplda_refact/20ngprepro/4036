would bother copy protection , . 
program 
good , pirate strip protection 
distribute strip version well week . 
hardware method prevent j. random loser use copy ii pc pirate 
software , stop anyone know people enough 
connection `` real '' pirate _ _ able defeat `` check 
hole '' code . 
may want price software depend tad 
higher ... price change $ 15 $ 25 probably would turn 
potential buyer , way could tolerate pirate whose 
number change price . 
20 % pirate figure ... ha , ha . 
course , lot pirate 
`` thing '' pirate software , even never use , 
perhaps really would count towards 20 % .

low .
