couple month ago go dealership test drive car . 
afterwards , 
sit discuss price . 
explain want car like 
one drive , different color . 
say could get one exactly like 
want dealer network within day . 
negotiate price 
sign deal . 
next day , get call . 
explain goof , neglect 
take account price increase . 
last price increase occur 
4 month prior visit . 
still want car , would 
fork another $ 700 . 
alternative , would honor 
price buy car test drive sit around 
6 month mile . 
say goodbye . 
good 
example lowball still cover butt . 

bad people demand honesty type dealer would 
longer business . 
next dealership go straightforward honest . 
first thing 
salesman say , `` let 's see dealer cost work 
much profit make . '' 
deal go problem .
