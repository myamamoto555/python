ibm , apple , motorola ready unwrap powerpc 601 processor 
wrap come powerpc 601 processor week , motorola 
corp. , ibm , apple computer inc. detail result yearlong 
effort . 
first series powerpc processor 32-bit 
processor 64-bit memory interface , much like intel corp. 's 
pentium , capability perform many three instruction 
per clock cycle , accord source familiar chip . 
motorola 
expect release chip volume year end two 
configuration , run 50 66 mhz performance 40 50 
mark , respectively , source say . 
floating-point performance 
processor even better , 
performance 60 80 , respectively . 
601 , scaled-down 
version power 220 chip develop ibm 
workstation , also include 32k single buffered cache chip 
protocol support motorola 's 64-bit multiprocessor bus 
build . 
chip , design initially support 
micro channel architecture , bus independent , vendor could develop 
powerpc - base system use number different architecture , 
include isa , eisa , sun microsystems inc. 's design , one source 
note . 
accord source familiar development effort , motorola 
extremely successful develop powerpc inexpensive 
architecture , despite complex design make 2.8 million 
transistor use technology . 
initial chip expect 
price $ 300 $ 400 -- slightly higher intel corp. 's 
486 processor -- could sell profitably less $ 100 , one 
source say .
