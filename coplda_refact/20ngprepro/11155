something similar happen - age ago work pgp 
use send short message development issue simply test 
new feature around . 
time pgp certainly newer version 
unknown . 
suddenly admin site use receive 
request stop send encrypted email . 
almost way 
automatic scanner could find , since would 
know pgp - must check unknown datum type 
message , try unscramble , find could get past pem 
armor part , contact ask stop . 
luckily 
current email carrier less picky go 
network . 
case people think email scanning take place , assure 
regularly many site - usually government 
agency least know , local administrator , 
reason , decide monitor communication 
sure think whole mess reason - stop hacker 
. 

several occasion get people trouble simply 
include traditional nsa bait message try 
. 
friend mine pick mention name 
uk town scunthorpe hint : look word embed . 
sure 
many example happen fact anyone 
example would appreciate hearing - could use 
ammunition talk privacy issue .
