invite onto state school president , 
conveniently fly coop , around . 
governor ohio , 
james rhodes , embark senate campaign , want know 
tough peacenik , order guard . 
matter quickly cover . 
year later , wound survivor launch 
civil lawsuit responsible ... settlement make , 
term , plaintiff could discuss much , guilty individual 
identify fact , shooter squad identify .

general command . 
study incident & 
photo , imo look like independent action small squad soldier .
