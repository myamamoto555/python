simply assert thing without support . 
analogy 
accurate assertion unsupported . 
try

murder one siamese twin kill 
womb . 
. 
equal argument . 
idea illogical . 
one siamese twin kill 
womb would likely kill well .

argument fantasy island . 
comparison total 
failure , demonstrate already , basis 
reality , neither legally medically . 
assert 
perfect comparison impossible , 
coercion oppression , ridiculous . 
say , 
give analogy little credit failure .

survive . 
, furthermore , already say , 
difference equal claim organ claim 
unequal .
