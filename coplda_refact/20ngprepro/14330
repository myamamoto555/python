hmmm ... would consider encryption weapon . 
would 
government classify encryption ? 
seem encryption ought 
cover first amendment . 
use line reasoning , 
government able restrict datum people encrypt 
encryption algorithm use would restrict 
one 's freedom speech . 
word , encrypted datum -- text , 
graphic , information -- another form free speech . 
reason government able regulate use 
encryption algorithm encrypted datum . 
time 
government able ` force ' someone reveal 
encryption key encrypted datum encrypted datum 
question may something protect first 
amendment kiddy porn . 
even case like 
government require get search warrant coerce 
someone reveal key . 
btw , encryption method consider state-of-the-art 
. 
feds relax export restriction des yet ? 
also , des still regard good form encryption ?
