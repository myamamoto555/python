------------------ 
still rather rough listing likely question 
information , program public key mail encryption . 

faq , write maintain marc

variety newsgroup monthly basis ; follow-up discussion specific 
redirect group . 
month , reformat post attempt comply 
standard hypertext faq formatting allow easy 
manipulation document world wide web . 
let know

nothing faq consider legal advice , anything 
one person 's opinion . 
want real legal advice , talk 
real lawyer . 
question answer 
--------------------- 
1 ? 
program perform privacy enhance mail pem use 
cryptographic technique rsa des . 
allow 
electronic mail property authentication i.e. 
send confirm privacy i.e. nobody read except 
intended recipient . 
write primarily mark riordan < > . 
code public domain , except rsa routine , 
library call license rsa data security inc. . 
2 get ? 
contain library cryptographic routine , 
consider munitions thus distribution 
people citizen permanent resident u.s. 
canada . 
therefore , follow request quote readme 
file : 
export cryptographic code distribution 
usa canada . 
personal request , 
#the author , condition use . 
note public domain , license 
include distribution . 
read use 
. 
best way get ask friend copy , since 
reduce load site carry mention 
human run . 
naturally require trust 
friend . 
available via anonymous ftp citizen permanent resident 
u.s. ; cd read readme file 
info . 
last look , site contain source tree , 
contain compile binary nice mac version . 
, well crypt stuff , `` home site '' 
, open ftp user 
u.s. canada citizen permanent resident . 
find 
obtain access , ftp , cd , read file 
. 
convenience , binary many architecture 
available addition full source tree . 
3 run machine ? 
probably . 
already port flavor 
unix sunos , next , linux , aix , ultrix , solaris , etc. port 
macintosh include standard port rather nice 
port write raymond lau , author stuffit . 
port 
expect , help user invite . 
4 work mailer ? 
probably . 
easy clean effective interface depend 
sophistication modularity mailer , though . 
user 
guide , include distribution , discuss way use 
many popular mailer , include berkeley , mush , elm , mh . 
code also include allow easy use inside gnu 
emac . 
make new interface create improvement one 
distribution believe convenient use , secure , 
may useful , feel free post . 
5 rsa ? 
rsa crypto system asymmetric , public-key . 
mean 
two different , related key : one encrypt one 
decrypt . 
one reasonably derive , 
may publish encryption , public key widely keep 
decryption , private key . 
anyone use public 
key encrypt message , hold private key need 
decrypt . 
note `` message '' send rsa normally 
des key real message . 
see `` des ? '' 
note provide privacy . 
authentication , 
fingerprint message see `` fingerprint , like 
md5 ? '' 
encrypt sender 's private key . 
recipient 
use sender 's public key decrypt confirm message 
must come sender . 
rsa name three man rivest , shamir adleman 
invent . 
find rsa , ftp look 
look . 
6 des ? 
des data encryption standard , widely use symmetric , 
, crypto system . 
unlike rsa , des use key 
encrypt decrypt message . 
however , des much faster rsa . 
use des rsa ; generate random key encrypt 
mail des use key . 
encrypt key 
recipient 's public rsa key include result letter , 
allow recipient recover des key . 
des sometimes consider weak somewhat old use 
key length consider short modern standard . 
however , 
reasonably safe opponent smaller large 
corporation government agency . 
unlikely future 
strengthen symmetric cipher , possibly use 
multiple encryption des . 
7 pem , relate ? 
pem privacy enhance mail , system allow easy transfer 
encrypted electronic mail . 
describe rfc ; 
document approve obsolete old rfc . 
really complete implementation pem , pem 
specify certificate authenticate key , 
handle time . 
addition plan . 
8 distribute authenticate key ? 
remote user able send secure mail , must know 
public key . 
able confirm message 
receive come , must know public key . 
important 
information accurate ; `` bad guy '' convince 
key fact , send message read . 
allow three method key management : central server , 
distribute finger server , flat file . 
three 
describe user guide part distribution . 
none provide perfect security . 
9 public key look similar ? 
public key begin pkc identifier describe various 
characteristic key , first bunch character 
key may lot people 's key . 
mean key similar , 
class key , generate program , 
length , etc. . 
10 fingerprint , like md5 ? 
md5 message digest algorithm produce rsa data security inc. . 
provide 128-bit fingerprint , cryptographically secure hash , 
plaintext . 
cryptographically secure 
possible reasonable amount computation produce 
different plaintext produce fingerprint . 
thus , 
instead sign entire message sender 's private key , 
md5 message need sign authentication . 
md5 sometimes use purpose ; example , often 
use map input arbitrary length 128 bit datum , 
passphrase interpreter cookie generator . 
md5 describe entirety include implementation c 
rfc 1321 . 
11 pgp ? 
pgp another cryptographic mail program call pretty good privacy . 
pgp around longer , work somewhat differently . 
pgp compatible way , though pgp also use rsa . 
major difference pgp : 
- pgp key management feature , particularly user without 
direct network connection . 
- conform pem rfc thus greater probability 
work pem software . 
pgp make attempt compatible 
anything pgp fact , pgp 1.0 compatible 
pgp 2.0 . 
- use , library rsa routine rsa data security 
inc. . 
come license allow noncommercial use . 
pgp use implementation rsa license ; thus , 
pkp , firm hold u.s. patent rsa algorithm , claim 
infringement patent make , use sell pgp 
u.s. canada . 
acknowledgement , pgp 's original 
author , phil zimmermann , say documentation : 
fact , live usa , federal agency , 
actually run pgp computer , public 
partners want forbid run software . 
pgp 
. 
- pgp , send outside 
u.s. canada . 
however , pgp already exist many ftp site 
europe place . 
whether use pgp whatever , documentation pgp 
recommend read anyone interested issue . 
note fact , regard patent export 
restriction , somewhat controversial ; many people think 
way , people interpret various document 
differently . 
unfortunately , discussion net inevitably 
seem produce heat light , probably belong 
. 
see : `` disclaimer '' 
12 ? 
stand rabin privacy enhance mail . 
similar , 
use public-key cipher invent rabin rsa 
attempt avoid patent rsa . 
write mark 
riordan , author . 
distribution halt , contrary belief many 
include rabin , public key partners pkp claim patent 
broad enough cover public-key cipher whose strength rest 
difficulty factoring product large prime , rsa . 
claim universally accept means , 
challenge pragmatic reason . 
really use anymore . 
compatible pgp . 
13 mime ? 
mime stand multipurpose internet mail extensions , 
describe rfc 1341 . 
find newsgroup 
. 
pem interact mime yet entirely 
clear ; people use stopgap solution mime type 
order send message mime one . 

hope standard emerge . 
draft internet document exist 
matter . 
14 simple way defeat security ... 
may wish check companion post `` '' 
discuss obvious attack 's security 
procedure minimize risk . 
's main `` weak area '' 
probably key distribution .
