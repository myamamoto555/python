let try drag discussion back original issue . 

note , necessarily dispute benefit 
eliminate anti-competitive legislation regard auto dealer , 
barber , etc. . 
one need , however , swallow entire libertarian 
agenda accomplish end . 
one grant benefit 
allow anyone wish cut hair sell service without 
regulation mean unregulated barber 
free bleed people medical service without government intervention . 
libertarian would argue . 
case case basis , ratio government regulation 
obviously worthwhile . 
libertarian agenda , however , call 
assessment . 
assume cost regulation 
kind always outweigh benefit . 
approach avoid sort 
difficult analysis , strike many rest dogmatic , 
say least . 
objection analysis medical care , education , 
national defense local police suggest `` free market '' provide 
effective , efficient means accomplish social objective 
provide `` statist '' approach . 
notable 
exception , however , see , worthwhile 
analysis carry self-professed libertarian .
