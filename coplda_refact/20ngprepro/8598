result , 400 bp , sequence 
characterize `` flight fancy '' `` fantasy '' ? 
unfamiliar scientific context , appear obvious 
speculation lack better neutral word 
least significant part consequence knowledge acceptance 
current theory couple observation . 
would appear 
something quite rational go attempt fit observation 
theory tailor theory cover observation . 

seem like example would normally call flight 
fancy fantasy .

well , think someone else thread first use word also , 
`` '' , etc. . 
prepare give general account 
rationality . 
term example , danger begin quibble 
`` surprising '' experiment , count `` surprising '' , etc. . 
may say `` logical grounds '' . 
point quite frequently 
perhaps even frequently root new theory trace 
previously exist theory even previously reject hypothesis 
theory domain . 
would offer rather well know example 
toricelli 's puy de dome experiment sake `` sea air '' 
hypothesis . 
theory result experimental test `` surprising '' ? 
well , give prior explanation phenomenon involve certainly must 
count . 
theory construct experiment design 
`` perfectly rational grounds '' ? 
well , pretty successful 
well know theory fluid . 
analogy fluid toricelli explicit . 
novelty thinking air fluid quite novelty 
time . 
theory interesting ? 
yes . 
`` new '' ? 
well , one 
could argue merely extension exist theory new 
domain , think beg certain question . 
debate 
like .
