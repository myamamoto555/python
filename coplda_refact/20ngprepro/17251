choose , would much

chronic carrier necessarily mean patient chronic 
persistent anything . 
person chronic carrier may clinical , 
biochemical , histologic evidence liver disease , may chronic 
persistent hepatitis , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis , hepatocellular 
carcinoma . 
case chronic persistent hepatitis cph probably result 
viral infection , although good number case cause 
determine . 
diagnosis cph make basis liver biopsy . 

consist finding portal inflammation , intact limit 
plate , occasion isolate focus necrosis . 
contrast 
chronic active hepatitis cah inflammation , 
bridge necrosis , fibrosis . 
cph , indeed , excellent prognosis . 
choose cah 
cph question would also choose cph . 
however , david point 
, distinction two neat would 
. 
histology sometimes pretty equivocal , biopsy show 
area compatible cph cah . 
maybe sampling problem . 
maybe 
continuum . 
know .
