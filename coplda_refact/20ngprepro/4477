organization : university illinois urbana 
lines : 24 
quick reminder : 
way interpret passage opinion . 
make 
sound opinion somehow undisputable fact . 
many would interpret passage cite differently . 
many -- several great theologian mention 
thing . 
people much expertise 
interpretation scripture probably anyone reading 
newsgroup . 
say wrong right 
, opinion , notice last three word come pretty darn 
close sin pride . 
future would suggest absolutist 
interpretation , especially contradict highly respect 
doctor christianity .
