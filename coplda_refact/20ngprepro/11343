think someone often immoral dream , like lustful dream , 
dream commit act violence , etc. etc. may sign 
something sinful heart . 
may holy spirit 's 
way allow sinfulness come light 
pray remove . 
generally , one 
pure heart , set mind thing holy , holy 
even dream . 
dream also lord . 
joseph two example 
people bible receive dream lord . 
regard body experience , something 
careful . 
call spiritual nature , especially 
one saw experience witness someone else . 
christian certainly avoid occult activity would generate 
body experience . 
thing might call 
might actually lord . 
paul write might .

third heaven .
