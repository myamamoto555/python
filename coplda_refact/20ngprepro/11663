sound like analysis base hypothesis 
actually use . 
would like give feedback base 
real life . 
keep advanced logic mode 
rarely light christmas tree . 
time 
middle major shopping area make 
sense since > 8 source come many different 
direction . 
find consistent 
reporting bogey regardless move car area . 
find directional indication useful . 
one case 
two radar trap set within one mile . 

pass first radar trap , direction indication change . 

detector set point forward direction . 

radar detector would assume due reflection . 
know high probability 
another trap . 
! 
occasion , directional help discern false alarm 
true alarm . 
example , pass source , direction indicator 
change . 
directional also allow focus attention 
signal might come instead look 
place . 
car approach rear detector 
leak , tell signal come rear 
car pass verify source . 
detector , would 
unable would assume radar 
trap none . 
several month find add feature 
useful gimmick .
