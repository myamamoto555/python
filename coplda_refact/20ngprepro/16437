whole hell lot better 2 3 degree 
differential timing measurement interplanetary network . 
ignore directional information ; look time 
arrival . 
three detector properly arrange , one often 
get position ~ arc minute . 
btw , oort cloud source : testable 
fairly near future ? 
grb short rise time < 1 
m . 
could detect curvature burst wavefront 
distance order b ^ 2 c b detector spacing 
time resolution . 
1 m b 2 au , 
order 16 light year . 
understand statistics reduce 
number considerably , would geometry burst come 
wrong direction .
