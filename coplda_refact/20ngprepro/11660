sorry , sherri , agree particular incident . 

cut number example 
rampant , difference . 
1 since time immemorial , batter complain call . 
pitcher catcher . 
usually , nothing happen . 
unless league notify team year allow 
complaint , hirschbeck act expectation . 
2 gant `` hirschbeck 's face '' . 
gant say 
something call , step box , turn away 
hirschbeck . 
hitter little consequence , 
decent eye , whenever receive short end stick 
questionable call , would want moment two box , 
reason rethink strike zone base 
experience last pitch . 
really angry 
ump , would rather turn away catch breath 
turn say something might get toss , 
especially key moment game . 
gant turn away , hirschbeck immediately motion gant 
step box . 
imo , point time , hirschbeck 
determine show gant exactly charge game . 
gant dawdle ; chance dawdle . 
hirschbeck 
simply exercise power play . 
gant resist , many 
might think unreasonable request , 
hirschbeck call pitch . 
point , cox come 
field , pitch throw , many braves leave 
dugout . 
cox toss `` protect player '' . 
pleasantly 
surprised gant keep cool enough stay game . 
small sample size , base see game , 
mark hirschbeck temper need play 
god field . 
good quality umpire . 

keep eye open future appearance hirschbeck 
future , order improve sample size . 
imo , game remember name umpire 
bad game umpire .
