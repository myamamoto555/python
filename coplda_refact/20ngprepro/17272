good question . 
answer : eisa bus move 32 bit rather isa 's 8 16 ? 
still move speed isa bus . 
think either 8 10 mhz . 
local bus design also move 32 bit like eisa , 
move datum cpu speed , 40 mhz . 
, cpu , local bus move datum 
33 mhz , eisa move datum 8 10 mhz . 
local bus 3 4 time faster eisa 
33 mhz cpu . 
eisa two maybe 3 time 
fast isa .
