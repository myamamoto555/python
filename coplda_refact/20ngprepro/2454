excellently put ! 
even libertarian , admit government thing 
like . 
beautiful perform art complex ft. lauderdale 
partially build tax dollar know much 
private much steal , mean public beautiful 
enjoy . 
keep mind , though , people city 
never attend single performance , might feel differently 
help pay . 
however , disagree desireable efficient 
give government case-by-case basis . 
fact , 
lot better luck maintain freedom speech precisely 
decide case-by-case basis much 
issue . 
judges decide whether political speech allow 
sidewalk front post office . 
try decide 
whether , pro-choice , pro-life , political speech 
allow sidewalk front post office . 

imagine result right free speech decide majority 
case-by-case basis . 
economic issue . 
government tell exactly 
charge , bus line lawyer . 
desireable decide rights free speech 
case-by-case basis , decide rights free enterprise 
case-by-case basis . 
hope government restrict 
free enterprise . 
hope , opinion , 
government interfere free enterprise `` efficient '' 
manner ; call political market failure . 
thus , value freedom abundance produce , 
swallow `` whole libertarian agenda . ''
