well , let see ... take class last fall , 
note 'll try wing ... 
's understand . 
remember stellar evolution 
black hole neutron star pulsar form high mass star , 
m star 1.4 m sun . 
high mass star live fast burn hard , take 
10 ^ 5-10 ^ 7 year go nova , supernova . 
time , 
live long enough get perturb galactic plane , 
assume source grb 's plane 
galaxy . 
take catalog burst recieve 
various satellite around solar system , pioneer venus one , either 
pion . 
10 11 , ginga , course distribution test 
catalog . 
test show , burst isotropic 
distribution evenly spread radial direction , show sign 
homogeneity , i.e. clump one direction . 
, unless 
sampling area inside disk galaxy , sampling universe . 
cool , want figure hell cause thing . 
, 
suppose say , `` well , stil may sampling inside 
disk . '' 
well , necessarily . 
remember , less 
interplanetary network burst detector baseline go 
beyond pluto pioneer 11 , able , detector de 
sort difference angle satellite satellite . 

analogy : see plane overhead . 
measure angle plane 
origin arbitrary coordinate system . 
one friend mile 
away see plane , measure angle zero point 
arbitrary system , . 
two angle different , 
able triangulate position burst , maybe 
find source . 
knowledge , one able . 
throw halo , corona model work , also . 

say , look possible astrophysics burst , short 
timescale , high energy black hole , pulsar exhibit much type 
behavior . 
case , say , star seem bind 
disk galaxy , especially energetic source . 
look simulated model , burst confine disk , 
sample large distance , say 750 mpc , definitely see 
anisotropy towards direction , clumping source 
direction galactic center . 
say , none 
characteristic . 
think ... someone need clarification , know 
something know , means correct . 
honor 
take burst class person modeling 
different distribution , pretty much kick around every possible 
distribution , outrageous source . 
collide pulsar , 
black hole , pulsar slow ... stuff like . 
fun 
field . 
complaint correction :
