subject kind bias , almost completely useless 
first baseman . 
raw stats , way tell 
first baseman 's putout make throw fielder , 
make play ; likewise , tell whether 
double play 6-4-3 3-6-3 . 
fielding run thus give first 
baseman credit putout double play , assist 
error . 
thus favor first baseman play deep , reach lot ball 
force pitcher cover first frequently . 
also hurt first 
baseman play behind left-handed pitching staff thus face 
left-handed batter .

better ; course , still first baseman 's 
defense .

defensive average , use larger probably better zone ,

233 batting run good , mostly past ; run
