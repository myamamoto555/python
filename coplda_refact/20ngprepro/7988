would like able detect angular position low accuracy 
ir emit source distance 100 meter better 
daylight . 
ir source could emit signature ; lean toward 
30 khz square wave 50 % duty cycle . 
consider use quadrant detector inc. give 
information head point sensor thus determine 
angle . 
source consider waze heck ir led , 
possibly motorola . 
waze would mean least 1 amp 
current pulse . 
current duty cycle led drop 10 % 
would need cycle five turn get 50 % require . 
anyone something like ?
