fully agree . 
addition , examine another 
doctor re-evaluate need medication take . 
remember guideline either saw text hear 
lecture , elderly adult receive medication 
need drug re-evaluate regularly . 
current physician 
unwilling , find one . 
either check phone 
book physician specialize geriatric medicine gerontology , 
contact physician referral line american medical society . 
find geriatric specialist , likely tune 
special need elderly adult maybe help .
