note newby : delta clipper project gear towards produce 
single orbit , reusable launch vehicle . 
vehicle 
scale vehicle design test concept ssto . 

currently undergo test . 
vehicle would full scale 
experimental vehicle capable reach orbit . 
yet fund . 
april 6th , rocky nelson macdonnell douglas give talk entitle 
`` optimize technique advanced space missions '' university 
illinois . 
mr nelson 's job involve use software simulate trajectory 
determine optimal trajectory within give requirement . 
although 
directly involve delta clipper project , spend time 
recently , use software application . 
thus use 
project example . 
think detail 
implicit trajectory simulation much interest reader hope 
- fall asleep part , think many 
interest detail glean example . 
first example give maximization payload polar orbit . 

main restriction acceleration must remain 3 g . 
assume 
drive passenger constraint rather hardware constraint , 
verify . 
delta clipper y version 8 engine - 4 booster 
4 sustainer . 
booster , lower isp , shut 
mid-flight . 
thus , one critical question shut . 
mr nelson 
show follow plot acceleration vs time : 
______ 
3 g | | 
| | ascii graph go , actually fairly 
| | good . 
big difference line 
2 g | | make curve 
| concave . 
datum approximate , 
| graph long . 
1 g | 
| 
| 
0 g | 
^ ^ 
~ 100 sec ~ 400 sec 
mention , critical constraint g level must keep 
3 . 
initially , eight engine start . 
vehicle burn fuel 
increase . 
get close 3g , booster engine 
back . 
however , quickly become inefficient low power , 
soon make sense cut altogether . 
cause dip 
100 seconds . 
eventually remain sustainer engine 
bring g level back 3 hold cut 
entirely . 
engine cutoff occur orbit . 
trajectory aim 
altitude slightly higher desire last vestige 
air drag slow vehicle slightly , thus lower final altitude 
desire . 
question audience : paraphrase 
q : would make sense shut booster engine pair , rather 
? 
: perceptive . 
worth consider . 
yet simulation . 
shut four part problem give . 
q : final payload trajectory ? 
: tell . 
`` read aviation leak . '' 
also apparently good 
propulsion example , tell use . 
question : anyone know security due sdio protect 
national security md protect interest ? 
second example reentry simulation , orbit pitch 
maneuver . 
biggest constraint one aerodynamic heating , 
parameter try maximize . 
show graph 
heating use two different model , show similar , 
think suppose assume mean accurate . 
end result polar orbit landing ksc , would 
30 degree would start reentry profile 
60 degree south latitude . 
would ask landing maneuver , know 
aspect flight profile .
