clarify earlier quote . 
god 's law originally write 
israelites . 
jesus change fact make law applicable 
people , jews . 
gentile could part kingdom 
heaven saving grace god . 
never say law make 
obsolete jesus . 
anything , clarify law quote make . 

follow verse , jesus take several portion law expound upon 
law give clearer meaning god intend . 
'll notice , 
also ream pharisees muck law contrived 
interpretation . 
know every letter law follow 
head heart . 
point righteousness 
must surpass pharisees order accept kingdom 
heaven . 
people pharisees really go 
way debate number angel dance head pin . 
become legalistic , - religious lawyer practice 
letter law never really believe . 
think agree today 's world , lot 
modern-day pharisee know bible end end believe 
. 
good head knowledge nothing heart ? 
christianity set rule ; lifestyle change one 's 
perspective personal conduct . 
demand obedience god 's . 
people live , many . 

choice respect god respect . 
god ,
