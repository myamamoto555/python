design , evolve . 
, much discomfort , 
human trouble-free birth process sacrifice increase brain 
cranial size . 
wild animal much easier time birth human . 
domestic horse cow typically worse time . 
give idea : 
family tree complicate pioneer great-great - 
grandfather several wife , never could figure wife 
child . 
one might ask happen . 
great-great - 
grandfather , time reach forty , quite prosperous 
farmer . 
nonetheless , lose several wife rigor 
childbirth ; graveyard spencer , indiana , boswell , north dakota , 
contain quite gravestone like `` ida , wf .

always fatal . 
often fatal , happen 
reach adequate help . 
often , permanently damage one 's health . 
clearly woman 's body _ evolve _ give birth believer divine 
design ; however , evolution favor trouble-free birth human .

, wroth ! 
read outrageous straw man attack 
month ! 
practically see mouth foam . 
statistically sophisticated enough balance risk . 
although 
produce exact statistics 5 year last time look 
, rest assure balance c-section risk risk . 
would encourage wife caesarean unless clearly 
indicate ; hand , oppose obvious grounds wait 
emergency give . 
bear mind : wife take lead decision . 
talk thing , lot leg work , main 
decision really .

heaven 's sake , everyone need ! 
people bother find relative risk . 
wife 
unwilling take significant risk order nice surroundings . 
view intensity birth experience , doubt surroundings 
much importance anyway . 
somehow value advocate seem 
lopsided : take risk , even fairly small , serious 
permanent harm order preserve something , , 
esthetic consideration .
