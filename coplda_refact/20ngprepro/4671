andy -- think agree , give clarification 
use term fact theory .

'll add falsification rejection way 
reduce current usefulness . 
long accurately predict 
describe thing observe . 
pain ass , reason 
say _ theory evolution _ rather _ fact evolution 
still theory _ . 
ask whole thread get start 
bother post refer _ fact evolution _ , 
basically leave phrase _ still theory _ . 
without 
clarification , like one give , say _ fact 
evolution _ different meaning .

useful model 
religious overtone requirement faith , unless course 
want demand factual physical entity describe exactly 
way theory formulate talk .

mechanism ,

sure agree . 
, may feel stronger 
separate term . 
try say _ theory _ 
propose explain _ mechanism _ _ mechanism _ 
reality . 
existence mechanism , 
thing , predictive consider 
fact would say . 
really little planetary particle 
system call atom . 
say , original 
point , would leap faith say , observe 
mechanism . 
need _ believe _ _ actually _ 
atom decide think . 
enough 
discuss mechanism . 
rate , sure 
clearer , think worth shot . 
bottom line , though , think agree two fundamental idea : 
1 . 
-- evolution theory support observational evidence way 
-- fact evolution theory support observational 
evidence way 
2 . 
-- creation opinion . 
theist want call 
theory . 
: support evidence 
neither predict support observation 
make . 
mechanism talk , really 
much say . 
agree ?
