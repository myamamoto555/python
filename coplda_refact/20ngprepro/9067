would explain widely separated detector , ulysses 
pvo ginga et al. , would see burst time . 
fact , - 
fore , widely separate `` interplanetary network '' 
sure way locate random burst . 
one detector , one 
locate burst except say `` somewhere field view . '' 
. 

two detector , one use time burst see detector 
narrow location thin annulus sky . 
three detector , 
one get intersect annulus , give two possible location . 
one 
location impossible , say , earth block part 
sky , , error box . 
, 8 detector , location determination , 
within 3 degree would someone gsfc , like david , like 
comment current state location determination ? 
. 
inde - 
pendent sighting detector help drive uncertainty . 
touch something mean , though . 
believe 
reference somewhere feature see 
fraction grb actually cause detector . 
would 
mean , nasty god , though , would naus crystal act like 10 ^ 12 gauss 
neutron star ... get far afield .
