sda total agreement darius say . 
also worship saturday honor lord . 
mention '' esteem 
day alike '' imo fast day observe jews . 

matter interpret passage , accept worship sunday 
honor lord , contrast many fellow 
sda believer may believe . 
, though , bible overwhelmingly point 
saturday day keep honor creation god 's 
deliverance israelites egyptian bondage . 
would 
attempt point observance saturday legalistic , 
simply case . 
rather , keep saturday allow full day 
rest contemplate god 's goodness grace .

idea introduce reason paul want 
corinthian lay aside money collection first day 
week receive weekly wages . 
paul 
want lay aside money collection first priority , 
spend money thing . 
proof front

home instead meeting .
