yes

yes , see , , clip-on , one-inch square larger . 
favorite 3.5 inch plastic fan use plop 
top chip service .

go - get `` blanket '' effect help chip life

longer system life make good economic sense

yes - well , melt cheese

let touch surface - `` rule thumb '' cool solid-state

`` attach '' fan look slick work well bother potential 
loss cool fan go . 
least power supply fan 
reach back every day feel fan blowing . 
prefer put stock fan drive bracket front panel 
blow air across cpu - depend lot case board layout , though . 
on-chip fan fry 's electronics sf bay area 30.00 . 

get stock power supply fan 11.00 .
