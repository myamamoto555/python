remember post last year indicate `` pitch clock '' try 
one minor league time back work . 
remember 
say work . 
anyone remember ? 
jody mcdonnel wip phil . 
say pitch clock 
inevitable . 
would pitch clock work throw first ? 
another pair suggestion : 
1 . 
remove balk rule . 
runner responsibility stay `` safe '' 
matter pitcher . 
2 . 
pitcher throw occupied base x time x 3 5 
without successfully pick runner , runner advance base 
walk . 
seem give pitcher advantage . 
allow 
runner `` challenge '' pitcher throw base .
