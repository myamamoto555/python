sabo 1539 452 .294 259 59 .228

's another one . 
1989 - 1991 joe carter 's batting 
average clutch situation significantly batting 
average situation year . 
presume think 
random .

clutch : 338 ab 68 h .201 
could expect 1992 mr. carter ? 
well , composite ba 1989 .268 ; 1990 
.262 ; 1991 .263 , think pretty good 
idea kind batting average produce . 
1992
