amir : 
would categorize sale land shaft ? 

sell jews ? 
fair assume 
would mistreat jew ? 
norm 
commerce read shafting arab jew ? 
claim landlords sell palestine 
true , even partially omit fact mandate 
treaty put lebanon syria french rule , 
palestine british . 
, landlord 
would find foreigner palestine would 
motivate sell , regardless price . 
interesting though acknowledge 
palestinian shaft . 
many israelis jews share 
opinion ? 
absolve purchaser 
ethical commitment write ? 
tell , see answer response . 

question whether intent behind purchase 
aim control public asset land , 
etc. . 
. 
. 
palestinians grounds 
contest legality purchase , say world court . 
sam 
opinion one else 's
