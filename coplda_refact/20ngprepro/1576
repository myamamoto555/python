read post , nothing new , see much 
typical `` christian '' anti-gay sentimental literature . 
gay people 
con - persecute long propaganda . 
may 
unaware statistica `` finding '' concern african-americans 
publish use various group bias 
african-americans . 
usually think kkk instance , 
many group . 
course , vast majority public 
scoff finding document today , always case . 
fortunately african-americans `` whites '' support 'cause ' 
public sentiment eventually entirely turn around . 

even civil war , sentiment increase . 
fact , law 
put place protect inalienable rights blacks pretty 
much legal discriminate . 
know many gay turn back right free 
form discrimination . 
may think deceive something , 
. 
church , christian church disciples christ 
openly affirm rights oppressed people segment society , 
include gay . 
believe gospel message preach creation 
make disciple . 
believe lord 's great commandment love , 
beleive stand oppressed , even popular 
. 
really like church last reason . 
find 
church almost anywhere valley stand gospel believe 
commandment love though hard-pressed find many actually 
sho love , many willing champion oppressed , especially 
within community . 
may lose face greater christian 
community unpopularity belief , abolitionist 
oppression african-americans . 
many even kill 
treat runaway slave `` '' . 
guess ` ve 
decide challenge worth . 
talk gay man woman hear tragic story tragic 
story center around fail marriage , wife husband straight 
hurt process , etc. . 
funny thing , know one 
case parent , ex-wife , even child continue reject 
gay family member son , daughter , ex-husband , father , etc. 
begin take part form support group , like pflag . 
legislation pass colorado , equally 
rage slimey people louis sheldon tradition value 
coalition actively work christian underground garner 
support within several 8 believe state coming november 
oppressive gay . 
perhaps get , maybe never . 
many get 
middle ages proclaimed god 's massacre thousand 
witch hunt inquisition . 
message come , loud clear , proponent gay 
rights gay general , strong dislike , even 
hatred gay , whether want call change 
result . 
major flaw posturing end , 
final effect post like mr. hudson 
`` conditional '' love gay . 
condition : change 'll love . 

sure strange come group claim god `` unconditional '' 
love , one call people `` . '' 
sure thing 
` naturally ' change , habit like alcoholism , wife beating , etc. 
need change sort therapy . 
thing 
like , etc. amount beat people , 
go result anything outward `` 
people 's expectation . '' 
process coerce conformity cause many 
people great deal harm , especially cause people 
nothing gain become even puff 
sense . 
sad , thoroughly believe one day change . 
may 
unpopular cry justice equality basis 
something personal like ` sexuality ' taboo subject even today , 
firmly believe rights individual free impose regulation 
thier bedroom . 
funny straight people successfully 
remove restrictive oppressive legislation invasive legislation , 
like maintain little chestnut repression ... though 
help maintain sense superiority least one segment society . 
gay people criminal . 
another interesting thing happen recently . 
prominent charismatic 
church silicon valley two pastor arrest self - 
admit charge pederasty man sex boy . 
apparently 
go time couple year ? 
, since charge 
voluntary , church work closely police , imagine 
manage downplay media . 
could thing 
happen church , , ex-gay ministry ? 
one friend 
recently tell `` approach '' someone go 
therapy , thoroughly convince request 
dinner invitation attend ministry . 
difficult time live , provide hostile environment 
create perpetuate atmosphere breed hate violence 
call christian community . 
result pass amendment 
colorado create organization poster appear 
colorado call `` '' forget whole definition hand , 
last part immoral gross homosexual trash motto 
`` work america '' implicit advocation violence . 
sick , seem mr. hudson , 
embrace . 
christian tradition oppression 
towards feel ` measure ' , constant 
organization like christian research institute , good 
purpose also , major work seem find new better way 
exclude people . 
gospel believe negative , rather seek way `` include '' 
people . 
several dr. martin 's book find quite helpful , 
especially concern ` cult . ' 
seem cri , become cult unto 
. 
stick positive find way bring people 
jesus take bullwhip drive away ? 
whatever
