modify quadra 700 higher speed . 
previously 
use variable speed overdrive accelerate cpu 
modification test stable higher speed . 
mileage may vary . 
top speed achieve predict 
hand . 
personal test fine 32 mhz thus far . 
higher speed clock oscillator hand test higher 
speed . 
part 
clock oscillator 4 pin ttl variety need selection 
speed begin 50 mhz . 
cpu run 
oscillator speed . 
original one 50 mhz unit . 
recommend 
get 50 mhz clock case damage exist one . 
obtain clock oscillator 
less $ 5.00 . 
part number : 
50 mhz ttl clock oscillator part # 
62 mhz ttl clock oscillator part # 
66 mhz ttl clock oscillator part # 
get half size clock oscillator . 
fit . 
also cmos clock oscillator . 
try one 
quadra . 
work fine 's 
socket : obtain 4 pin socket form factor 
14 pin dip package . 
alternatively , use 4 machined socket pin 
augat style socket . 
cut socket . 
cool fan : small 12 volt fan keep cpu cool 
must . 
vso come specially modify heatsink 
fan build onto . 
pass-through connector 
tap hard drive power cable . 
rig 
something similar risk frying cpu . 
procedure 
1 insert usual disclaimer antistatic warning . 
2 remove top lid machine . 
see floppy disk 
hard drive mount plastic tower . 
follow usual 
precaution course make sure machine 
. 
unplug cable , wall monitor power supply cord 
back mac . 
3 remove power supply pull plastic interlocking tab 
tower forward simultaneously pull power supply straight . 
tab piece plastic left posterior aspect 
tower extend downward hook power supply . 
may 
also feel horseshoe shaped piece right portion power 
supply . 
leave alone . 
plastic tab tower 
need release . 
4 look rear tower assembly . 
see flat ribbon 
scsi connector hard drive , power cable flat ribbon cable 
lead floppy drive . 
disconnect motherboard . 
hard drive power cable connector tab must squeeze 
release . 
5 unplug drive activity lead clear plastic mount 
6 look posterior , cylindrical section plastic tower . 

phillip head screw base . 
remove , take care drop 
case . 
bit gummy glue screwdriver helpful 
. 
7 remove tower assembly pull medially plastic tab 
right side tower . 
tab prevent tower slide 
posteriorly . 
slide entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly 
lift tower assembly straight case . 
8 remove interrupt switch assembly . 
strangely shaped plastic 
device left , front edge motherboard . 
pull middle , 
rear plastic prong forward . 
entire device release . 
9 unplug speaker cable . 
squeeze plastic tab speaker 
free swing backwards free case . 
10 remove motherboard form case . 
lift front right corner 
motherboard 1 mm . 
allow clear clear plastic 
power light guide . 
slide motherboard forward 1 cm . 

motherboard come directly . 
11 locate 50 mhz clock crystal . 
small metal box near 
cpu chip . 
note remember orientation . 
new clock oscillator 
must align pin 1 orientation . 
carefully remove old clock oscillator . 

pin may bent . 
simply . 
sure 
iron hot enough heat board . 
use suction iron accomplish task . 

appropriate first soldering experience . 
motherboard 
multi-layer design fine trace - easily damage without 
proper care . 
12 install socket socket pin old oscillator . 
13 put 50 mhz clock oscillator new socket . 
could use 
old clock solder pin . 
may come inside 
socket cause corrosion problem later . 
suggest use new 
50 mhz clock . 
14 install cooling fan system complete modification . 
14 reinsert motherboard slide place . 
15 snap interrupt switch assembly speaker lock mother 
board firmly . 
plug speaker wire back motherboard . 
16 reinstall tower assembly first place right wall 
tower right wall case tower assembly 
1 cm posterior intended position . 
lower tower assembly 
place maintain contact right wall case . 
fully , slide tower assembly anteriorly click 
place . 
17 reconnect motherboard end cable . 
dont ' forget floppy 
drive cable . 
18 replace phillip head screw 
19 drop power supply straight place click . 
20 plug hard drive activity light back clear plastic mount . 
21 reattach cable power cord . 
cross finger turn 
mac . 
make usual power chord . 
, 
something amiss . 
immediately turn power recheck 
handiwork . 
well , sincere condolence . 
hopefully , work normally . 
turn machine back 
replace 50 mhz clock oscillator faster one . 
reboot 
astounded . 
need fully test machine many hour decide 
particular speed truly usable . 
vso , machine lock-up 
might take 8 hour operation occur . 
brief time since 
modify clock oscillator 36 hour single 
problem . 
good luck attempt modification . 
small real 
risk , could well reach quadra 950 speed higher less 
$ 50 part .
