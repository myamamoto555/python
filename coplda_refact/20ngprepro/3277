anyone first hand knowledge ?

ok , fact two distinct component transmit 
chip ; real message encrypt `` conventional '' key , 
serial number encrypted `` conventional '' key encrypted 
kind bogus , whole concept `` one key million 
people use change '' seem reasonable `` family 
key '' . 
suppose analyze output chip able determine 
bit encrypted packet contain serial number 
session key . 
suppose also design simple algorithm base 
information take datum contain encrypted session 
key twiddle bit several send line . 
mind , sure nsa thought along dozen 
attack imagine , system probably somehow design 
manipulation information cause compliant 
receive chip somehow fail decrypt successfully . 
? 
two party agree advance kind consistent 
scheme , decryption chip see restore 
`` proper '' bitstream eavesdropper get e k ; uk packet 
wrong ? 
suppose could easily defeat chip `` send '' 
information many time slightly different way , make 
effectively impossible certain know information 
send .
