thought mean global positioning system . 
two precision level , one 
army application killing accurate today one civil 
one . 
civil precision 20 30m correct , wrong , 
though , may map building . 
way 
additional reference point e.g. one fix gp system house get 
high precision military version , get pretty complicate 
. 
use microwave system actually mean type radar , 
need quite lot number crunching get accurate datum 
original signal . 
gp system seem better run 
idea application discussion newsgroup , 
know address anymore .
