firstly , would never consider try make one-shot timer . 
cap 
design ram battery substitute , rather use 
application wish drain cap constant current . 

performance , respects , akin battery normal cap . 
point big electro 's usually rate -5 % +20 % tolerance , 
calculate exactly capacitance particularly consider 
cold . 
look design micropower oscillator divider chain , 
`` roll '' zero maximum count , vice-versa every 
seconds . 
use something like clock , would 
need divider chain 2 ^ 27 , give error less one percent 
firing time six week period . 
course , could trim 
oscillator give exact time , oscillator 
remain exactly constant -40 low anyway . 
would suspect would far drain firing 
solenoid would timer circuit . 
caveat - experience low temperature electronics , 
guarantee approach best inhospitable 
condition .
