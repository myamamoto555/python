thanks people recommend workspace manager 
windows 3.1 . 
find 3 shareware workspace manager , australia 's 
archive . 
, mirror 
site u.s. . 
three find : 
1 . 
workspaces 1.10 
smallest simplest 
workspace manager find . 
easy use . 
display small window , contain 6 button , plus extra 
button configuration purpose . 
one annoying feature 
title window first present run - must press 
key mouse button ! 
thing go away . 
also , would 
nice `` always top '' set little 
window contain workspace button . 
maybe user-specified 
string button instead number one six might 
nice feature . 
simplicity ease use workspace 
manager make attractive package . 
2 . 
1.6 . 
zip 
workspace manager offer 
feature workspaces 1.10 lack , quite time consuming 
set thing . 
workspaces 1.10 , first workspace 
initially empty . 
1.6 , need take `` snapshot '' 
want workspace look like - i.e. 
application contain . 
also , main window quite large , 
allow small view workspace . 
workspaces 1.10 , facility view 
workspace without switch . 
1.6 provide 
view functionality quite useful . 
3 . 
2.30 
interesting package , contain 
goody well workspace manager . 
goody 
include `` '' , provide pop-up root menu 
press certain mouse button - like . 
menu 
totally configurable , offer unlimited depth cascade menu , 
provide quite handy access application . 
could 
say alternative program manager . 
also 
bundle `` '' program call `` '' , allow 
run window application dos shell window 
instead use file manager run application . 
actual workspace manager call 2.30 . 
work quite 
differently two workspace manager 
provide certain number disjoint separate workspace . 
fact , basically enlarge desktop configurable amount , 
choose region desktop want screen 
focus . 
mean window overlap different 
view region , unlike first two workspace manager 
workspace isolate one . 
control window 
allow move window around enlarged desktop . 
basically 
control window provide small scale view view area 
actual computer screen provide large scale blow-up 
particular section . 
try . 
impress , 
find one suit need best .
