make real sense . 
actually , make reasonable amount sense . 
fix disk 
sector buffer controller , transfer 
memory ` rep ' whatever instruction call 
quite efficient single instruction , go fast 
know use bus . 
since 286 cache , 
bus likely critical resource relative cpu performance , 
possible dma bus interference would cause much 
loss cpu cycle ` computing ' ` rep ' sequence . 
floppy , hand , buffer , use cpu 
floppy datum transfer pc jr , way really 
stink .
