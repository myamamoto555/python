back high school use work detail company , one 
service offer engine cleaning remove oil 
sell car ... ; - . 
unfortunately , high pressure 
washer would use one several mile shop . 
one 
occasion wash engine , would start water would 
get distributor would put plastic bag around try 
minimize , around spark plug wire , etc would nearly 
impossible try wipe area dry rag . 
usual 
solution carry wd-40 , car would start spray 
likely area would start first time . 
may myth , certainly keep strand car wash ...
