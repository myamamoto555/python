david l. hanson 
opinion express ! 
people know , believe fundamentalist sufficiently 
ill-defined advise use specific term . 
think many 
people use cover people believe inerrancy number 
related concept e.g. denial evolution . 
original 
fundamental movement somewhat specific , would think 
people accept inerrancy would actually support whole original 
agenda . 
include list key traditional doctrine , e.g. 
virgin birth . 
term use press describe 
aggressive conservative religion general , typically 
attempt legislate religion . 
legalism yet another ill-defined term . 
however 
reason use context . 
fact common theological 
definition believe salvation law . 
hope 
one believe conservative contributor hold 
view . 
however basic difference approach 
expect get bible . 
conservative approach expect 
find specific behavioral rule . 
generally poster advocate 
approach talk relevant passage paul 's letter god 's 
law . 
liberal approach expect find general principle , 
regard specific behavioral rule subject change depend upon 
culture thing . 
easy see liberal would regard 
conservative approach legalism . 
hard know quite 
term use . 
issue case inerrancy , 
one say paul make factual error . 
rather , question 
whether statement take law . 
call 
positive answer legalism seem obvious enough terminology . 

see good alternative .
