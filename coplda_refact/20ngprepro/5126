'll fun look rear-end gear sho -- taurus 
front-wheel-drive vehicle ... 
go back check article ; sho wagon quicker 
sho automatic , significantly slower real sho . 
anyone would order sho automatic transmission 
beyond ; handle stick , stick 
regular taurus leave sho real driver . 

say real driver use stick eg 
disabled person , position use 
sho anyway . 
would willing bet remove automatic 
transmission `` '' car like 5.0 l 
mustangs , camaros , like would cut number 
accident year . 
auto fine sedate little sedan , 
business performance car , .
