> computer room wire ? 
require two separate grounds . 
one ground go ground pin 
outlet , ground wire connect outlet 's 
mount tab thus grounds box faceplate screw metal 
faceplate , . 
ground go normal distribution panel ground . 
outlet wire generally connect insulate 
distribution panel , turn , connect 
main ground wire . 
two separate ground system connect together 
building 's service entrance . 
one also connect every 
ground piece electrical equipment whole building , 
isolate ground share equipment plug 
outlet panel . 
someone happen 
accidentally short one phase feeder ground , 
main building ground likely lot noise 
breaker trip fuse blow , isolate 
ground remain relatively .
