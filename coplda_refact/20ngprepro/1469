situation prior post , definitely immune 
stressed . 
blood test show vitamin level low . 
sinus 
mess - doubt mucosal lining cilium heavily damage . 
also antibiotic 15 time 4 year ! 
end , even two week 
work confirm diagnosis chronic bacterial 
infection sinus via , mucus color get 
detail , symptom . 
three traditional ent 's make 
diagnosis culture , however , 
difficulty right symptom clearly show 
bacterial infection . 
enough background provide help 
understand make comment anti-fungal 
therapy . 
first question . 
fungus penetrate little way poor 
mucus membrane tissue , maybe via hypha , thus cause symptom , without 
consider ` systemic ' classic sense ? 
sort inbetween 
infection .

steve really

concern , , toxicity vitamin a. doctor , 
blood test , put 75,000 iu vitamin one week , 
drop 25,000 iu next couple week . 
also receive 
zinc supplementation , since interrelate fairly 
complex way doctor explain one ` evil ' orthomolecular 
specialist . 
blood test three week later vitamin normal , 
stop vitamin except 
supplement , make sure maintain 50,000 beta carotene . 
call carrot face . 
: ^ 
hopefully , elaine 's doctor take similar , careful approach 
supplement . 
even reevaluate supplement take , 
example , niacin fairly large dosage , 1 , steve dyer 
good information . 
niacin second-order 
improvement symptomatic relief sinus allergy , probably 
worth take large dose long-term risk liver damage . 
> survive . 
get access lot glucose , bloom ride 
> organism live sinus , gi tract vagina . 

though believe , base successful therapy , 
definitely excessive growth fungus unknown species 
sinus , still want ask question : study 
demonstrate candida `` bloom '' sinus associate sinus irritation 
? 
sinus irritation reduce significantly one 
week new treatment implement 
time - noticeable gi track problem start 
, day go away - consider 
normal . 
btw , doctor dig one medical reference book sorry , 
remember one , find obscure comment date back 1950 's 
state people develop contain non-lethal 
infestation sinus lead sinus 
inflammation symptom . 
'll dig reference since 
relevant discussion . 
> people really develop bad inflammatory process mucus 
> membrane skin bloom site . 
whether allergic like reaction 
> candida certain . 
doctor test believe rast rast similar test allergic 
response specificially candida , show strong positive . 
another question , would everybody show strong positive test 
essentially useless ? 
, assume true candida grow 
part-way mucus membrane tissue , concentration exceed 
threshold amount , could person test allergy 
candida definitely develop allergic symptom , mucus membrane 
irritation due body 's allergic response ? 
say earlier post , 
one need rocket scientist , m.d. degree 
ph.d. biochemistry see plausibility hypothesis . 
btw , 'll repost . 
dr. , book , `` sinus survival '' , 
routinely give , anything else , systemic 
anti-fungal , safe good new chronic 
sinusitis patient antibiotic four time 
last two year . 
claim 2000 patient , well 
90 % notice relief sinus inflammation symptom , 
cure means , imply so-called infection 
primary cause , later complication . 
also find 
nystatin , whether take internally , put sinus spray , help . 
imply course assume excessive bloom 
aggravate sinus inflammation grow partway 
tissue since nystatin kill 
direct contact - absorb blood stream . 
, admit , 
lot ` ' , ` imply ' , please hard-core nt 
double-blind study non-issue , one start 
plausible , , . 
> internal , symptom use symptom pretty 
> nondescript . 
bring interesting observation use deny 
reject aspect ` yeast hypothesis ' 
appropriate study . 
observe culture 
yeast `` bloom '' gut sinus , way diagnose 
even recognize disease . 
know realize virtually 
impossible test candida part body 
easily observe since candida everywhere body . 
real catch-22 . 
another catch-22 : totally reject ` yeast hypothesis ' say 
study actually study , 
certain standard , perspective , 
even consider . 
agree appropriate study 
, take big $ right . 
however , order 
convince funding agency austere time open wallet , 
literally give evidence , acceptable evidence 
compete proposal paradoxically almost exact study 
need funding . 
, 90 % study even get 
funding scientist national lab , aware 
smaller funded project . 
afraid even dr. 100 
doctor get together , pool practice 's case history anecdote 
compelling picture , approach funding agency , would get 
nowhere , even able publish statistical result . 
obvious comment doctor 
decide excessive yeast colonization gut sinus lead 
noticeable non-lethal symptom exist , even tenable 
hypothesis , amount case history compile anecdotal evidence 
contrary never change mind , , would 
also oppose needed study mind issue - 
excessive yeast growth lead diffuse allergic symptom , 
, exist .

, evidence mycological study indicate many 
species grow hypha `` root '' deep tissue , similar mold grow 
bread . 
continue kill surface , nystatin , 
kill deeper tissue without use systemic 
anti-fungal itraconazole older one 
toxic effective . 
,

e-mail contact - thanks , nystatin effective long - 
term treatment gi tract `` candidiasis '' . 
like try weed garden

walk away . 
$ 60000 question whether contain candida `` bloom '' partially 
grow tissue mucus membrane , cause type symptom 
susceptible people e.g. , allergy , without become `` systemic '' 
classical sense word - something strictly excessive 
bloom cause problem full-blown systemic infection 
potentially lethal .

say private e-mail , flaw current medical system 
make difficult even impossible physician attempt 
alternative therapy therapy work . 
example , go three ent 's , say live 
sinusitis ab 's fail mention 
surgery open ostium , ostium plug would 
get root cause condition . 
three month aggressive 
fairly non-standard therapy , body nutrient level monitoring 
equalization , vitamin c , , echinacea , etc. , health vastly 
improve two year ago , health greatly deteriorate . 
course , skeptic would say maybe nothing would 
improve anyway , view stretch thing quite far 
experience three ent 's see say would `` live 
'' . 
confident reach one could call total `` cure '' . 

anti-fungal program undertake one necessary step direction 
overuse ab 's last four year . 
note : 
sinus problem , may suggest book dr. mention . 
sure get revise edition . 
> ... often wonder m.d. chronic 
> gi distress sinus problem would problem tell 
> patient non-existent syndrome . 
dr. start chronic severe sinus problem , 
visit several ent 's totally floor say `` 'll 
live '' . 
spend several year try everything - standard 
non-standard , essentially cure chronic sinusitis . 

share approach book honestly say road 
recovery follow part . 
one recommendation take 
systemic anti-fungal beginning treatment history 
overuse prove time time 
practice . 
sure comment hard-core belief anti- 
`` yeast hypothesis '' poster would definite thing say , , 
`` work wonder almost two thousand case '' , put mildly . 
also would surprise would say one violate 
moral obligation help patient . 
maybe doctor read practice 
confront patient symptom could due `` hypothetical 
yeast overgrowth '' e.g. , fit profile people 
identify , consider anti-fungal therapy avenue 
exhaust . 
remember , theory practice two different thing - 
one without , synergistic . 
doctor 
something non-standard yet produce noticeable symptomatic relief 
thousand patient , least sit take notice ? 
maybe ought trust say begin hypothesize work 
instead work . 
afraid lot doctor become 
enamored `` scientific correctness '' ignore patient 
swear help . 
; balanced , 
see poster group . 
come point 
use little common sense , maybe empirical approach 
try good systemic anti-fungal 
exhaust avenue . 
one traditional 
medical establishment able help , natural thing : 
go couple doctor 's somewhat outside establishment , 
result find significant relief . 
would better traditional medical establishment set 
kind mechanism doctor , without fear sue 
license pull , try experimental unproven beyond doubt 
therapy patient finally reach point 
accept therapy ineffective ? 
would like hear doctor tell : 
`` well , try therapy approve accept 
country , since clearly work , authority 
use experimental , unproven technique seem help . 

promise anything , risk . 
sign 
something say understand experimental possibly risky nature 
unproven therapy , 'll register case state 
board . '' 
anyway , ent suggest , would jump 
pronto instead go one doctor , either altruistic 
reason , greed , practice alternative therapy much 
risk risk meaning lose license possibly 
patient . 
mechanism would keep control mainstream medicine , 
also provide valuable datum would essentially free . 
also would 
morally ethically better current system show 
compassion medical community patient - everything 
within reason help patient . 
lack mechanism 
lead large number people try alternative therapy , 
seem work like case , never work 
true quackery . 
better get soapbox post reach 500k size .
