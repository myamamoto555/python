ask . 
would echo question . 
try 
contentious . 
assume pope universal jurisdiction 
authority , authority rely upon decision ? 
prevent choose doctrine like say 
papal disagreement error resolve time ? 
especially true , since council bishop basically 
stand pope . 
ultimate question traditional theology church . 

thing possible resist pope : 
departure traditional doctrine church . 
command 
authority conflict tradition , command must 
disobey . 
view conflict could happen major 
way . 
god would never allow situation develop ; 
would complex people figure . 
view 
present situation church anything extremely complicate . 
run list happen last 30 year 
catholic church , impartial observer aghast . 
appear much lie heart matter 
disagreement tradition tradition , also 
authority discipline . 
problem stem general widespread ignorance catholic 
faith , opinion . 
catholics know zilch 
catholic faith ; leave wide open destruction err 
bishop . 
basically reformation part ii . 
even question mind respects 
shard catholic church currently trample upon 
catholic hierarchy . 
could go listing shocking thing 
hour , probably . 
take situation campos , brazil , example . 
read book 
happen vatican council ii . 
bishop , antonio 
de , never introduce change follow 
wake vatican ii . 
keep traditional mass , old 
catechism , etc. . 
make sure people know faith , 
catholic theology obedience , modernism , etc. . 

people come . 
well , one day order come rome retirement . 
come 
pope sick . 
bishop de wait pope 
recover , inquire whether command pope really 
want , something liberal command absence . 
pope confirm decision . 
good bishop retire . 
injustice follow completely incredible . 
new bishop 
install . 
proceed expel bishop de 's 
clergy church , refuse celebrate new 
mass. . 
new bishop would visit parish , celebrate new mass. . 
people would promptly walk church en masse . 
bishop 
enrage . 
usually resort enlist help 
secular authority eject priest church . 

priest would start build new church ; people 
completely behind . 
old parish new mass , 
bishop desire -- virtually parishioner . 
prime motivation completely illegal , accord 
canon law . 
priest penalize way say 
traditional mass , legislation enact pope saint pius v. 
obligation say new mass. . 
process , people campos , private 
individual , include civil authority , constantly send 
petition letter rome something new modernist 
bishop . 
nothing ever ; help ever arrive rome . 
eventually 37 priest kick , 40,000 people . 
question supporter sspx : 
way position respect church reform 
could change conform pope ? 
assume 
pope 's position change leader sspx 
jointly make choice . 
, appear claim infallible teaching authority . 
adopt view `` wrong , ca wrong , 
way 'll change mind , must change '' , 
either leave catholic church leave . 
pope define certain thing ex cathedra , would end 
controversy . 
process well understand 
catholic theology , anyone go along 
instant non-catholic . 
problem people appreciate go 
catholic world . 
know faith , bishop 
, would shock ! 
sould argue second come `` real '' 
traditional teaching church . 
simple matter 
east west would separate 900 year . 
case catholic church . 
massive body 
traditional teaching . 
pope last 150 year 
especially relevant . 
question traditional 
doctrine . 
think teaching church allow 
error teaching regard faith moral even short term . 
` 
may wrong , roman catholic . 
: - 
heresy , less . 
although great job 
since reformation , last 30 year see many error 
spread pitiful . 
infallibility rest pope , church whole . 

short term , pope , large section church go astray . 

fact , usually happen major heresy : large 
section church go astray . 
pope historically 
much reliable . 
everything always come back long 
run . 
would effect pope make ex cathedra statement 
regard sspx situation ? 
would honor ? 
, 
get around formal doctrine infallibility ? 
, try contention , try understand . 
since orthodox , get real vested interest outcome , 
one way . 
yes , would honor . 
infallibility infallibility . 

go define ? 
new mass better expression 
catholic faith old ? 
sex education catholic 
school wonderful ? 
religion wonderful except 
profess popes prior vatican ii ? 
command legitimate . 
sspx view 
pope 's command legitimate . 
? 
slippery slope . 
really ; start study major catholic theologian last 
300 year . 
everything well spell . 
west excel 
critical thought , remember ? 
catholic theologian 
busy century .
