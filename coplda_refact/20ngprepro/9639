seriously doubt practical implementation proposal would 
place onus individual register key . 
realistically , 
probably emit id code serve identifier 
request key fragment . 
chip manufacturer would register 
identifier code vs. key combination chip make 
uninitiated end-user therefore remain completely outside loop . 
chip could use cellular phone , modem , device -- 
really make difference : authority detect use 
encryption standard surveillance , would capture id 
apply key order decrypt datum . 
-- 
rob neat thing standard : 
ham radio : many choose .
