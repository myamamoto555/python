fallacy , first time point . 
one , never give set moral people agree upon . 
unlike 
football . 
, conveniently ignore 
many would agree morality something . 
analogy 
hold . 
one expect sufficiently many people agree football , 
give evidence vanish number disagree 
set moral give . 
, evidence , proof . 
proof would evolve testing 
theory absolute moral compete theory . 
one argument reiterate never answer 
objection . 
evidence preacher .
