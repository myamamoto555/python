talk laser jet 4 believe postscript . 
see advantage use pcl hardware 
plug work support language 
suit job . 
besides think pcl even capable 
handle 1200 specification . 
experience laser 
master 1200 bring 1200 use postscript . 
also fast print mode postscript , lower 
resolution think , fast !!!! 
particular product 
use host processor process postscript , even decent 
pc know go slow i.e. slow compare high-end workstation 
process ps . 
quality difference noticable almost worth wait 
ps processing - rather impatient . 
use b&w camera image . 
gray scale image 
accept m word hand ps printer driver convert 
image postscript hand postscript 
processor . 
postscript render ram lot 
shoot directly printer . 
ps processor also 
accept ps file create source include dos application , 
windows run time printing . 
ps processor 
responsible would say pretty good job . 

camera image come good opinion . 
good laser master 's 
demo though . 
know many similar product would 
surprised several .
