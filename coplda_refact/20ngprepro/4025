find credible argument , two reason . 
one 
supply : unless care enter usa time 
future eg . 
taiwanese backyard cloner - btw know 
custom silicon reproduce pirate 
arcade machine like - would care less , 
go care much us confidentiality , ? 
people like 
real , care travel various country business 
reason , sit follow law like , would contend 
main threat . 
also grave doubt whether widely distribute silicon 
could possibly call `` classify . '' 
like hand military 
secret whole world envelope mark `` open . '' 

imagine several credible defence could employ come 
trial . 
one would stupidity government 's action .

amusing thought : could employ 
fast software implementation , easy custom hardware ? 
des , extensive use permutation table trivial hardware : 
swap bus line , relatively slow software big effect 
speed difference hardware software implementation 
cipher indeed , suspect lucifer 's designer well aware 
would , approve . 
certain usually parallel search 
slow software , yet fly custom hardware . 
proof employment clipper -- pure conjecture . 
however , software implementation cipher something 
designer would try avoid cost , inclusion 
technique seem credible . 
hmmm ... also wonder intergraph think use name 
`` clipper '' device .
