mention whether cost issue . 

exactly run 100mhz ?? 
digital side ? 
ttl ? 
ecl ? 
run 100mhz ic test equipment 
day long ecl domain , use dip 's along 
's , pitch 's name 
. 
see problem packaging long 
adhere sound engineering practice . 
good source information motorola 's system design 
handbook . 
latest ed . 
date . 
consider 
one bible high-speed design . 
fact need build test fixture mean 
likely go need socket . 

far inductance per pin package 
testing , mention impedance discontinuity . 

see big concern packaging 
probably go make much difference 
try get ttl run 100mhz , fun ... 
ttl never design run 100mhz environment .
