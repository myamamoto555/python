mac group . 
nice delete item prompt . 
whit : 
buy quantum 240 mac home . 
pay $ 369 . 

^ ^ ^ 
see ide drive cheaper .

correctly point following : 
> since mac use hard drive ye `` figure include 
> hundred $ $ $ scsi driver '' sloppy people dumb . 
say sloppy dumb resound discount mac 
give `` maxtor 245 meg ide drive $ 320 '' example . 
give 
example give imply consent mac info include 
scsi . 
ok scsi spec list : 
> spec list ? 
talk scsi pc , mac 
> unix box . 
talk isa bus , possibly eisa vlb . 
ok v e r y l o w l y understand 
whether mac pc different 
asynchronous synchronous . 

different speed cost . 
lump together ` ' 
dumb sloppy . 
take quote later example problem 
pc world spec list know number 
come article . 
show article correct 
scsi .

already give . 
keep delete ! 
spec 
everybody add info : 
chip asynchronous range : 
synchronous range : common pc world ; difference 
mainly software hardware . 
controller chip ; also call 8-bit : 
burst . 
advertise byte 
pc speeds . 
mac , pc . 
see follow either mac pc 
fast mode : burst 
fast : burst 
interface let speak : 
> ide range 0-8 .3 . 
asynchronous range : infer byte 
synchronous range : 0-8 .3 .

note also give average put hold true 
mac clone correct hardware software . 
since pc use theoretical performance figure 
? 
continue thread state clearly scsi talk 

make difference .

pc article like follow obvious problem 
people report ! 
like . 
look use scsi quote : 
comment 
`` although twice fast esdi , asynchronous 
chip 20 % faster ide ... '' asynchronous 
chip 8-bit pc magazine april 27 , 
article confuse , scsi . 
term mess use 
interface mess . 
scsi mean `` set scsi interface compose '' 
` ' people want use . 
read quote read : 
asynchronous chip 
`` although asynchronous twice fast esdi , one third 
speed ide ... '' 
asynchronous chip 8-bit 
`` although chip 8-bit eight time fast 
esdi , 20 % faster ide ... '' 
note nonuse ` scsi ' . 
eliminate . 
continue thread state clearly scsi talk 
. 
lump 
everything scsi sloppy , wrong , dumb . 

usage also problem . 
clean 
mess like svga several year ago everybody uncle 
slap ` scsa ' monitor unlike 
svga year ago except .
