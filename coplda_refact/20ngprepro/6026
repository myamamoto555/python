problem `` let 's assume '' reasoning , take extreme 
close , arrive `` let 's assume perfectly ok . '' 
assumption make big one . 
system really secure , 
government keep algorithm secret ? 
plenty 
encryption algorithm depend upon nondisclosure secure , 
world use one ? 
reason , course , 
certainly think honest one . 
next , assume `` trust '' escrow house . 
last time check , 
every single branch government experience unauthorized disclosure , 
corruption , even fabrication , supposedly secure datum . 
govt 
say `` yeah , serious , trust . '' 
. 
finally , although state explicitly , implicitly assume 
warrant mechanism country safe reasonable . 
case 
ventura county man shot kill officer serve deliberately 
warrant tell govt long way go 
score . 
remember catch drug dealer , right ? 

point , current proposal , deploy , render truly secure 
encryption much expensive inconvenient uncle sam 's brand . 
able afford , sufficiently motivate , purchase 
expensive , inconvenient higher protection ? 
somebody lot extra 
cash ... 
following true ever : 
`` strong encryption outlaw , outlaw strong 
encryption . ''
