keep mind car korea luxury ruling 
class afford . 
every government agency worth salt find reason 
levy tax car ownership ; last hear , seven different 
fee pay car . 
believe sort petty bureaucratic 
inefficiency new president kim young sam want eradicate . 
basically , 
think rule come place bureaucrat plebian background 
want wreak revenge ruling class . 
exchange , zaibatsu 's like 
hyundai screw smaller company , perpetuate vicious cycle . 
faith korean people potentially build car well anyone 
else , hyundai car seem reflect tension within society , 
screwy component work together . 
stubborn like mule , 
car either go forward stop .
