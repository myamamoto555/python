put two rider identical machine . 

one know , , faster . 
may 
possible improve technique idea , 
trial error , effective methodology . 
understand technique steer motorcycle one 
improve technique hold apply human 
endeavor .

consider understanding physics traction absurd ? 
seriously suggest one form traction management 
policy without understand factor increase 
decrease available traction ? 
braking ? 
highly unlikely biker go develop maximum 
swerve ability without knowledge turn technique . 

ride life may problem , emergency 
situation definately place disadvantage .

disagree . 
existance immense success ride course 
teach technique indicate concept teach manner 
neither confusing , detract aspect 
course .

perhaps , ensue discussion , stray far 
point , claim knowledge steer technique irrelevant 
rider 's ability . 
find assertion ludicrous .
