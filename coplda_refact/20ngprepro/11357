read first come , controversy break . 
put name 
wait list library way book really 
offensive , none money would find way author 
publisher , read , `` cover cover '' use phrase seem 
popular right . 
like . 
write style little hard get use , 
well worth effort . 
come similar background rushdie 
grow bombay muslim family , move england ; grow 
new delhi , make strong impression . 
use many 
strange construction indian english : `` yaar '' end 
sentence , `` , '' occasional hindus phrase , etc. . 
time still `` '' thought muslim , 
could see flap . 
seem clear 
allegory . 
clear describe local prostitute 
take name persona muhammed 's wife , 
grandfather thunder imply muhammed 's wife prostitute ; 
short , every angry muslim read even part book seem 
miss point completely . 
mention fact 
militant never even see book . 
oops , ! 
perhaps deep sense , book insulting islam , 
expose silliness reveal religion - omnipotent deity 
need agent ? 
come directly , ?

put little verse ? 
muhammed marry four 
woman , muslim allow ? 
although think biggest 
insult islam majority follower would want 
suppress book , sight unseen , `` holy '' guy .

> year , make point , various primarily muslim 
> poster respond , say yes indeed read book 
> call thing `` filth lie '' , `` would rank 
> rushdie 's book hitler 's mein kempf worse '' , . 
much response try talk book . 
really 
silly argument - , many people read `` mein 
kampf ? '' 
make wonder - afraid ? 

read book decide ? 
maybe reaction muslim community book , absence 
protest `` liberal '' muslim khomeini 's fatwa outrage , 
final push need atheism !
