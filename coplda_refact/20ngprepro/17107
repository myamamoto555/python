extended ride passenger 750 ninja . 
. 
well , hate wet sock , , well ... 
passenger many bike longest time start 
ride , grow hate long ride sport bike . 
passenger 
seat design long ride . 
passenger position 
even usually design short ride . 
end torture knee 
back take long ride passenger sport bike . 
one 
reason originally like current much 
bmw . 
: 
would suggest shorter extended ride first -- short turn mountain 
. 
see much pain , proceed . 
best advice would give beginning passenger : 
- get bike rider say ok , work sort 
signal rider tell ok get . 
get 
bike squeeze rider hip tell ready , stop 
nod head show ok get . 
- keep foot peg time . 
wiggle unless rider 
ask : 
- best passenger unobtrusive . 
echo movement 
lean rider . 
look shoulder comfortable , 
turn look shoulder inside turn . 
- get use rider 's shift style rider : use reasonably 
consistent shift style . 
avoid `` helmet bonk . '' 
helmet bonk 
rider rev bike shift sudden change 
foreward acceleration cause helmet bonk . 

get old real fast . 
- pull stop , put hand hand tank keep 
weight push rider onto tank . 
put hand 
tank also good way stretch back pain , 
tell get harder steer turn leave . 
- switch hand guardrail stretch shoulder , 
sure squeeze thigh rider know ` re 
still . 
guard rail safe hold onto rider . 
- afraid ask frequent stop pain 
lose feeling foot . 
passenger seat generally design 
comfort . 
work sort pull signal beforehand .
