receive graphite vl thursday , little bit 
experience . 
general , feel fast , although 
first vlb card try . 
still , result 
impressive . 
mb , run , follow 
1.0 result : 
card wp cad spread paint overall 

ati graphics ultra 13.5 14.5 19.1 25.0 18.0 
ati ultra + aperture 11.2 13.8 10.7 20.9 14.1 
hercules graphite vl 16.1 67.8 41.4 52.8 44.5 
unfortunately number , ati ultra pro vlb 
overall score 26 . 
ultra pro nearly 
fast text handling , blow away cad paint test . 
additional test , complex coreldraw ! 
slide resize - 
redraw time . 
swap , would expect fairly 
heavy load cpu . 
graphite redraw time average 10.2 
seconds , ati ultra pro 12.0 . 
jive steve gibson 's 
contention isa graphite faster ati complex 
micrografx draw document . 
far , impress . 
driver look solid , card fly . 
installation utility different , comparable ati 's . 

wait build 59 reliability ... hercules ' 
software developer special , get evaluation copy card 
$ 225 $ 200 isa version . 
call want 
give try -- happy customer !
