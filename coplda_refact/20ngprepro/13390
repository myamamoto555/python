thanks letter , comment help . 
last comment , certainly realize intend 
sound way . 
still try understand spiritual 
truly one three time . 
description 
either platonic sound like special plead sort , 
`` appear three seperate way , really 
one , trust '' . 
neither . 
fact , far description trinity make 
sense one , 
`` economic trinitarianism '' . 
accept three aspect 
intrinsic nature god , perhaps lean towards latter . 
try , , see anybody come another description 
orthodox believable .

fear orthodox theologian overly love paradox , 
extent well-meaning people think flat-out 
confuse . 
problem thing 3 1 , e.g. 
3 different part 1 . 
father , son , holy spirit 
exactly part god , part thing distinguish 
physical separation . 
three person omnipresent , 
obviously physically separate . 
way 
different aspect , mode , whatever , one god . 
accept 
economic trinitarianism , possible 
substantive difference standard view . 
possible 
find neo-platonic explanation illuminate ?
