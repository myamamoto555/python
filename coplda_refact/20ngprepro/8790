difficult problem obviously good 
solution . 
one approach simply try move political opinion 
hope new libertarian consensus last . 
another 
approach try amend constitution . 
original 
constitution restrain u.s. government economic intervention 
100 150 year , depend one want count . 
first amendment , though weaken many way , still restrain 
government particularly state local , even though many 
particular issue majority favor censorship . 
think 
libertarian would happy another 100 year restraint via 
amendment two think likely happen . 
necessarily mr. hendricks , poster seem see 
problem libertarianism , stable . 
might 
true , objection libertarianism per se . 

libertarian political consensus form decade two 
fall apart , would back . 

unlike case socialism socialist consensus hold 
fall apart would leave , 
instead lot bureaucracy would hard get rid , 
tyranny end condition strong socialist consensus .
