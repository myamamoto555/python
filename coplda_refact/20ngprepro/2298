terminology ? 
quartz , hence resonant frequency . 
low power quartz oscillator usually 32 khz 
significant temperature drift , one often notice 
wear watch one 's wrist . 
low temperature sensitivity 
available crystal type , unfortunately 
larger higher frequency 1 mhz take 
battery power . 
programmable timer might less accurate , 
suitable crystal oscillator .
