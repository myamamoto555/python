really thing disagree . 
maybe agree 
disagree ?? 
still think tell newby steer leave turn

get bike ride damn thing .

: - 
understand physics traction fine - see 
detailed theory like place motorcyle training course . 
need know maximum traction obtain tyre 
begin slide road .

jeez , ed , start talk traction management policy 
think make weird reference look railway 
locomotive ... 
official line though doubt 
front brake apply first , follow rear brake , idea 
avoid lock rear weight transfer take place . 

practice suspect people describe .

slide tyre , way know whether ` ve 
achieve maximum brake . 
suggest always 
aim brake hard possibly - want find 
limit machine , go beyond . 
case , maximum brake , suggest aim keep 
wheel point slide , 'll 
exactly suggest !!
