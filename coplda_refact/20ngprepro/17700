cryptography , couple thing come mind read 
post . 
1 . 
clipper chip go export ? 
, 
people communicate country ? 

. 
encryption technique 
legal assume government crack use 
go overseas , within state ? 
2 . 
read authentication system use electronic 
security card look like calculator create encrypted 
pin base . 
host system algorithm 
build well authenticate user . 
form encryption technology would create 
key valid certain instant time ? 

system would allow `` window '' time around instant 
key would work . 
realize technique would increase amount information 
need store would need entire algorithm rather 
key . 
smaller scale thing might work . 
could similar method use make two 80-bit key 
issue tap phone usable one-week 
instance . 
need , would 
go back escrow service get another key . 
would 
make useless local police database key use . 
assume possible receive phone would need 
able message . 
thought subject ? 
thanks ,
