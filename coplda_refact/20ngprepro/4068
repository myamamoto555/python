would like respond . 
`` goal never achieve '' , reward come 
try . 
paul make clear claim continue strain 
prize philippians 3:10 -16 . 
live 
command stagnate become lukewarm , spit jesus . 
say 1 john 5:3 : `` love god : obey comand . '' 
obedience strain achieve god . 
course , 
require work part . 
quote james , satan care believe . 

matter result belief work . 
one truly faith 
one believe , one either act faith lie 
oneself believe first place . 
stan , first line , good point . 
obedience 
obligation god desire . 
instead , look 
many time bible talk joyous situation 
god 's work . 
begrudge work value . 
also , 
work necessary whenever , feel 
jesus ' presence . 
feeling deceive . 
however , paul state 
timothy 2 timothy 4:2 : `` preach word ; prepare season 
season ; correct , rebuke encourage -- great patience 
careful instruction . '' 
also , remember paul tell timothy 1 
timothy 4:16 : `` watch life doctrine closely . 
persevere 
, , save hearer . '' 
, order work necessary , need sure 
correct first . 
remember jesus ' warning matthew 7:3 -5 
hypocritical . 
best way accomplish 
disciple completely thought deed .
