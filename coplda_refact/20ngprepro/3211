far simmons look like total idiot . 
1 zane smith learn `` '' return dl . 

would rather zane smith pitch right handed moeller pitch . 
2 sure simmons ready say tell otto 
impressive win last week . 
otto 's latest debacle restore simmon 's 
reputation . 
look like back '92 form 
al 's highest era among starter . 
four sake ted 's sake , hope 
pitch 3.5 era rest season . 
yeah , right . 
3 tomlin merced bit disappointing . 
still decently . 
consider considerable amount talent maturity 
show first season , seem actually get little 
bit worse . 
tomlin almost unhittable rookie year lefty batter . 
merced good oba rookie year . 
show lot concentration 
plate rookie year . 
4 walk : well , seem lose end tonight . 
still think 
walk contract . 
5 leyland accept part blame situation . 

understand management 's fear lose tom prince 
waiver . 
even , use . 
aright hander like slaught . 
smart platoon . 
also , blame leyland case , since convince , give 
way much time last year regular season playoff slaught 
play 7 game ; good average right handed 
pitch . 
leyland simmons forsee last year , attempt 
trade last year ? 
fool could tell 
fit last year . 
6 dennis moeller scary !!! 
7 : well , go high era end 
season . 
maybe 3-4 range . 
$ 1 million plus ? 
come . 

customary home run give stage patterson go week , 
patterson serve pirates well year . 
far , seem 
pitch well rangers . 
think pirates spend money 
patterson stead . 
8 rookie batter : well , young surprise bit instant impact . 
, excellent performance much surprise . 
think thank doughty . 
9 rookie pitchers : worse expect , especially cooke . 
10 slaught : come give contract extension last year ? 

value increase immensely . 
11 lonnie smith !! 
well , eric davis sign comparable amount . 
let 's see . 
eric hit better . 
run better . 
field better . 
didnt pirates go eric davis . 
injured davis better 
healthy lonnie smith . 
even smith get big hit year , asset . 
look terrible basis field . 
12 management : big big zero . 
sauer yet make forceful agreement 
favor revenue sharing . 
seem concerned please 
idiot danforth prepare team move tampa bay . 
13 alex cole fiasco . 
pirates infield cf position look good . 

rf lf would look good could get cole replace 
two four outfielder . 
eric davis , van slyke cole would make 
respectable outfield . 
even without eric davis , thye pirate would 
respectable outfield cole , svan slyke , merced think hit 
left hand left stead switch hit . 
simmons option 
outfield . 
ironically , biggest accomplishment simmon 's tenure 
get alex cole really cheap . 
bad . 
14 compensatory draft pick bond : forget . 
pirate rant rave . 
get pick . 
, issue still appeal . 
, doesnt convince anyone simmons sauer idiot , 
nothing else . 
final note . 
tim wakefield awful last 2 
start . 
count pitch like last year rest 
season . 
also , pirates contention towards rthe end 
season , miss 's clutch hit speed peak 
second half last 2 season >
