read normally read group , look valentine radar 
information sigh , maybe faq come across post . 
. 
buy '93 probe gt pep last july 9500 mile 
debate sentra , , , stealth , prelude , 
celica . 
check month 's consumer report previous probe record . 
criterion : `` fun '' car ab , airbag , , less $ 25k . 
think turbo , check insurance people rule . 
tri-star car since air bag . 
ditto mustang also ab . 
fall category . 
good used car buy . 
mx-6 almost roll like . 
like prelude . 
weird . 
mr2 much smaller non-passenger space need , go . 
celica `` ok '' load option somewhat 
non-turbo form . 
never consider 240sx since airbag . 
look 
rwd virtue . 
corolla never enter mind . 
look mitsubishi stealth . 
since list exhaust , buy probe . 
: - 
car design different earlier year , early see 
reliability far . 
worth , comment : 
dislike : 
shut door window inside rarely make good wind seal . 
headlight `` stick '' time weather ? 
air conditioning break ~ 4000 mile pressure cycling switch 
condensation around rear washer fluid container drain completely . 
cram engine ; little hope typical 
part somewhat expensive normal ford part 
underside plastic like sharp driveway typical . 
assembly gripe : tape radiator , screw fall dash , seat seam 
stitch properly . 
hopefully fluke . 
ford give 1 key car . 
c'mon ford , spend extra penny ! 
rear hatch padding corner . 
wait day 
bash head corner . 
horn button behind air bag spoke center personal preference 
tire fling onto side car 
likes : 
engine torque -- definitely # 1 
handle good fwd ; understeer limit 
transmission 5 speed must 
usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere 
little torque steer full power much better '90 sho drive 
stability 100 + mph high gear though 
low cowl good visibility front 
heated outside mirror nice fog , never test freezing weather 
bag see 
rear seat fold rear seat passenger trunk important 
noise go still ! 
tire : goodyear eagles 70 % leave ; hope 30k : - 
see , primarily interested engine . 

car turbo rush , big selling 
point all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine . 
overall car good buy money . 
market segment change 
much since july prelude vtec , honda del sol ?? 
. 
drive work 
day relatively smooth road , noticable thing 
probe 's suspension like pothole . 
test drive one , find 
potholed road somewhere around town see jarring get tolerable . 
3 + passenger , means bring along . 
'll find 
room back 'll find car ride 
differently `` better '' . 
also , lot glass 
around expect ; temperature inside car get pretty 
hot summer . 
back seat passenger complain 
lack ventilation ; may want consider combine 
heat . 
hear exhaust system trouble , mine work fine . 
leather keyless entry system available get car 
comment get car officially announce . 
prefer cloth leather anyway . 
would want car snow : suspension rough 
inevitable surprise pothole , tire mean snow , seat assume 
wear lot thick clothing . 
rain much better : water 
generally bead windshield freeway speed , windshield wiper 
control easy understandable , barely 
eagles really try . 
also definite lack cup storage place . 
gt 
map holder speaker door , rigid plastic 
could fit two cassette cd 's max . 
center 
rest 1 cup holder back front seat cloth `` pouch '' 
. 
change holder . 
quite let-down sho . 
probe definitely car car ! 
lastly , store wet car cover back . 
foam soak 
water result smell pleasant .
