mean effective measure . 

say deter individual commit capital crime 
first place . 
true question whether threat death likely actually 
stop one murder . 
commit treason -- 
capital crime anywhere usa ? 
, death 
penalty , would introduction deter would-be criminal 
commit crime ? 
doubt . 
first step . 
even strong deterrent 
short complete deterrent would reject . 

case innocent execute ? 
even could eliminate possibility , would reject 
death penalty immoral . 
make something radical 
issue , although think many opponent captial 
punishment agree , find innocent execute 
strongest argument make . 
would , magically place charge , facilitate suicide 
criminal . 
could replacement 
capital punishment . 
want live rest 
life jail would always option .
