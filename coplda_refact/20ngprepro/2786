| `` objective value ... ? '' 
| please specific , importantly , motivate . 
'll take wild guess say freedom objectively valuable . 
base 
assumption everyone world deprive utterly 
freedom every act contrary volition , 
almost would want complain . 
therefore take assert 
believe `` freedom valuable '' , almost everyone see 
, every bit absurd assert `` rain '' 
rainy day . 
take candidate objective value , 
necessary condition objective morality objective value 
exist .
