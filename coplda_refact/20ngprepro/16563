arabia ; indeed , mass citizen demonstrate 
favor butcher saddam kill lotsa muslims ,

rich muslims also thumb nose west .

clarinet post edit stuff ; follow ??? 
friday 's new york times report group definitely 
conservative even sheikh baz follower 
think house saud rule country conservatively 
enough . 
nyt report , besides complain 
government conservative enough , : 
- assert approx . 
500,000 shiites kingdom 
apostate , charge saudi islamic law 
bring death penalty . 
diplomatic guy sheikh bin jibrin , ? 
- call severe punishment 40 woman 
drive public back protest ban 
woman drive . 
guy group say , 
, say woman 
fire job , jail , brand 
prostitute . 
want see happen , ? 
` ve 
hear many muslims say ban woman drive 
basis qur ` , ahadith , etc. . 
yet folk like ban , want 
woman falsely call prostitute ? 
, would choose hero wisely , 
, reflexively rally behind 
anyone hate anyone hate . 
- say woman allow work . 
- say tv radio immoral kingdom . 
, house saud neither least favorite government 
earth ; think restrict religious political lot , among 
thing . 
think likely replacement 
go lot worse citizen country . 
think house saud feel heat lately . 

last six month read step harass 
religious police -- government western woman 
fully veil something stupid woman , imo , 
send wrong signal morality . 
read 
crack , home-based religious 
gathering , even post reward government-owned newspaper 
offer money anyone turn group 
dare worship home secret place .

wind sail opposition .
