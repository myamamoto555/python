- justified piss doctor ? 
- 
- last saturday evening 6 year old son cut finger badly knife . 
- take local `` urgent general care '' clinic 5:50 pm . 

story delete 
- bother . 
son get three stitch emergency room . 
still 
- try find charge clinic write 
- letter . 
certainly never set foot clinic . 
- 
people charge already know kind ` care ' 
provide , give rat 's ass repeat business . 
much likely good write local newspaper , 
broadcast news show . 
, keep letter short point 
discard hand , emphasize exactly 
upset . 
possible local health department help complain 
someone official , really , ` clinic ' exist sole purpose 
generate walk-in income advertising , nothing 
change -- hope help someone else avoid . 
glad sound like son ok , anyway . 
opinion , course ,
