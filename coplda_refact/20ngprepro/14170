true note think , lasorda 
fire least two reason : 

1 publicly humiliating player ; 
2 knuckle player wish . 
fine line `` get player ' input '' `` knuckle 
player ' demand . '' 
manager , much like military officer , 
need player ' complete obedience respect 
game . 
game , big deal , time 
react , player must trust manager team often 
fall apart see : boston red sox , ff . 

strawberry 's demeanor represent media , often sound like 
demand . 
suspect comment like `` enjoy hit fourth ; 
use '' would get pretty brutally misinterpret media 
come strawberry . 
russ porter quote strawberry say , 
`` feel comfortable hit cleanup think perform best 
role . '' 
paraphrase memory bias . 
seem like 
fairly answer almost certainly question 
like , `` feel move third spot order ? '' 
player might answer `` manager know 
. 
think batting third help team , 
. '' 
would ignore answer brown stuff , seem 
little bit overreaction brand darryl 's response petulant . 
personally , think argument nonsense really 
matter much order # 2-5 player order bat , 
except personal stats . 
darryl , would probably answer 
question , `` number four spot get opportunity get 
pay rbi . 
think best bat fourth , willing 
hit third tommy think benefit team . '' 
something like 
. 
would helpful salary time -- rbi 
hit third -- make sound like `` team '' player . 
since strawberry 
likely go arbitration , use free agent market 
next contract , maybe argument useless , would help 
image media without appear totally . 
remember , media belief one 's best man hit 
fourth , argument sensible , regardless whether 
true .
