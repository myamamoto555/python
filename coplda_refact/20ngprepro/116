standard work detect forgery ancient document 
probably writing friedrich blass , `` und 
kritik , '' _ und _ , vol 1 
_ handbuch der - _ : 
beck , 1886 . 
portion describe nibley , _ 
prophetic book op mormon _ , pp slc : deseret book , 1989 . 
want attempt reading forewarn . 
nibley 
describe blass typical german scholar claim little 
knowledge subject , proceed exhaust subject 
reader . 
nibley 's extract blass 's work form 
`` rule forger . '' 
make interesting reading . 
confess read blass 's work , nibley 's extract 
thereof . 
german fall far short would require 
far know english translation available . 
however , 
believe technique describe know widely enough 
competent classical scholar could examine purportedly ancient 
document least determine consistent one 
would expect genuine document time frame . 

able prove write least able 
determine reasonable confidence time 
culture later forgery . 
actually 2 type purportedly ancient document : 
1 . 
alleged actual holograph early copy thereof . 
example 
dead sea scrolls . 
test various scientific 
means determine age paper , ink , object find 
. 
provide pretty clear date actual 
physical object . 
2 . 
document claim copy ancient work although 
copy may much recent . 
example might find 
document monk claim copy something 
century ago perhaps even several 
generation . 
problem still 
test although test likely simple . 

expect test age physical object tell much 
must confine testing text . 
important remember none test tell 
document really claim . 
date 
document identify culture origin . 
example hear 
letter suppose write jesus king 
iraq . 
document actually turn 
scholar could date paper ink assume 
holograph . 
could check language , content write 
style see consistent would expect 
palestinian jew time . 
however even test result 
positive way determine jesus actually 
write . 
would know time culture come 
bar known sample jesus handwriting clue 
comparison scholarship must stop . 
seldom way 
determine actual author . 
say , expert blas 's work . 
remember 
test apply alleged copy ancient work . 
specifically might ask : 
1 . 
document internally consistent ? 
contradict 
? 
work short would relatively easy 
maintain internal consistency , even forgery . 

longer forgery difficult maintain consistency . 
reason successful forger stick short document . 
2 . 
consistent history geography time ? 
short , non-specific work might testable 
write significant length latter-day forger would 
able escape detection . 
look minor , inconspicuous 
thing someone culture would get right without even 
think later forger would find numerous 
trivial check . 
devil detail . 
3 . 
literary style work , figure speech 
etc. . 
ancient writer would almost certainly speak way 
seem strange . 
odd phrase book ? 
fit culture ? 
course complication document 
translate , possibly even somebody update language 
copy . 
case language culture 
claim may allow recent copy . 
cause problem 
reduce certainty sure necessarily prove forgery . 
test quite effective give enough material work 
easy . 
require skill 
historian , linguist , anthropologist etc. . 
question 
ask , `` every aspect document consistent 
know culture claim origin ? '' 
thing 
fit significant ? 
problem area due 
lack knowledge , later change really 
significant ? 
often ambiguity since never 
know everything culture . 
end result testing occasionally certain 
particularly case holograph ancient copy . 
however often may probability indication 
document maybe part probably authentic 
sometimes maybe part later addition . 
often 
unsettling generation raise tv problem 
solve 30 60 minute time commercial . 
, 
however , real world scholarship offer .
