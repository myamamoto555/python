-- begin -- 
base experience set slip dos windows , 
comment set slip environment . 
thank 
trumpet beta tester cwru slip beta tester comment . 

configure modem : 
turn dtr 0 & w 
disable dtr communication program use 
dial slip server drop dtr exit program 
therefore hang line . 
use program like kermit 
establish slip connection , need . 
program necessarily hangup line exit . 
note : use univ. minn. . 
phone dial establish 
slip connection , need turn dtr . 
b dial establish slip connection first . 

automatically use program like phone university 
minnesota dial establish slip connection load 
slip packet driver . 
phone script language simple 
phone script easily write configure phone work 
slip server . 
addition , packet driver 
phone work currently , easy write 
batch file hack let phone work packet driver . 
section phone document script 
batch file example . 

configure slip driver : 
five slip packet driver commonly available 
peter 's compress slip driver 
peter 's slip driver 
. 
com driver like phil burn 's modify driver 
driver ethernet simulation slip 
univ. minnesota driver base 
four , vastly prefer . 
exe . 
com 
follow reason : 
much faster even though modem uart 
b use , several 
notice pc clock get mess perform 
long ftp transfer . 
c support use ethernet simulation mode 
d use ethernet simulation mode seem work 
every application test . 
instruction . 
exe use phone 
load slipper autoexec.bat file accord instruction : 
instance v. modem 
slipper vec 62 baud 
b use dos application win 3.1 dos box , use 
double-ended packet driver shim -- create virtual 
packet driver . 
dos application native mode , 
application windows 3.1 dos box windows application 
use virtual driver . 

c use , load next . 
configure 
use interrupt . 

instruction . 
com : 
try get version 10 slip driver . 
philip burns northwestern 
university modify . 
com driver better hardware 
handshaking . 
driver distribute along . 
b load driver establish slip connection . 
modem 
v. modem , would load driver . 
- w - h 4 slip 
c discuss use dos application windows 3 . 
x 
dos box , probably want use 

d use , load 

instruction : 
choose use instead . 
com , 
instruction exactly one crucial difference . 

delete line `` device vcd '' section 
. 
interfere run regular windows comm 
application crosstalk , get lot drop 
character etc. application . 
therefore 
recommend . 
would load : 
- w - h 4 

configure windows 3.1 : 
make follow modification file 
section . 
list com port , address interrupt .

also within windows - control panel , 
`` port '' icon . 
ii give port modem attach generous com buffer 
10000 
iii change com port value com port wish 
use modem zero . 
amount time 
windows wait seconds hand control com port 
another application . 
use want switch 
one session another , value default value 
2 seconds , get gpf windows crash . 
0 
also within windows - control panel . 
386 enhance , `` device contention '' , set 
device contention com port modem 
`` never warn '' 

additional note : 

assign different ip address 
slip session ? 
fortunate campus slip server assign user 
permanent ip address , worry editing 
time establish slip connection . 
assign new ip address every occasion dial , 
please try use aware software , let 
configuration . 
however , aware 
work slip connection . 
get work 
situation , must following : 
edit file . 
let net section look like : 
net 
name 
ip 
whatever appropriate 
20 
60 whatever appropriate 
save change , file 
`` + r '' 
start slip connection , remember name ip address 
assign . 
time start 3.1 x , 
general configuration dialog box open . 
enter name 
ip address assign session , click ok , 
run . 
change make 
save , . 
elegant solution problem dynamic slip ip address 
assignment provide victor 
victor use program preparation . 
use inquire assign ip , save 
file call `` '' . 
another file `` '' essentially complete 
file lack ip address . 
final step `` '' 
`` '' copy single file . 
example 
victor 's batch file provide : 

slipper 

- `` ip '' % % \ '' '' 
- `` ip # : % '' 
copy q net + + e : \ com \ \ 
del q 

echo . 
echo ready run 

question detail , please contact victor 

software attempt add capability . 

use slip ? 
work . 
com packet driver , crash 
immediately use 
work . 
exe , use ethernet 
simulation mode . 
example configuration show : 
latest release 1.2 c ; important 
use version , want use virtual packet driver 
application like trumpet windows release shortly . 
autoexec.bat 
lh vec 65 baud ether packet driver 
lh 5 65 5 load 5 virtual packet driver 
lh 7f 65 first virtual packet driver use 
lh 
63 65 use native dos 
additional virtual packet driver load directly within 
windows 3.1 dos box . 
example , pif file load 
direct file `` '' . 
read 
like : 
60 65 load virtual packet driver 
cd \ 

cd \ 
60 u unload packet driver 
exit cause dos window close 
similar batch file load dos application 
like pc gopher . 
experience work fine 
even virtual packet driver two independent virtual 
session , load software interrupt . 
example 
within two different box -- one 
gopher , virtual packet driver load 
instance . 

much degrade performance ? 
v. .42 bi modem run windows 3.1 
reasonably fast video card ati graphics ultra . 

condition , three virtual packet driver load 
use follow : 
driver -- ftp client session 
b driver one dos window -- session 
c driver another dos window -- trumpet dos 
get ftp transfer rate 0.8 - 1.0 transfer 
compress file . 
rate comparable get 
load packet driver , single session 
active . 
use packet driver single session 
active , get transfer rate 1.3 - 1.4 
file . 
40 % degradation performance slipper , 
benefit able use outweigh 
performance hit . 

ethernet simulation mode 
ethernet simulation mode , ver 1.3 work 
application test . 
one two application 
require ethernet simulation balk 1.2 , even 
rare problem resolve ver 1.3 
slipper use ethernet simulation mode , use , 
get error message console window read 
`` ip : incorrect packet type '' `` ip : bad version number '' . 

seem prevent function , although comment 
loss performance . 

application work 
ethernet simulation mode ? 
rare event find package work 
ethernet simulation mode , first contact author -- 
peter -- let 
know . 
chance fix . 
meanwhile , try follow . 
know 
kosher , work problem ver 1.2 
load describe section 
load , run application terminate 

also work within windows 3.1 virtual dos box . 
however 
packet driver like use one virtual box 
time . 
example , batch file run grateful med 
medical reference retrieval program develop national library 
medicine . 
- w - h 4 load 
cd \ 
search 
cd \ 
terminate 
exit close dos box return windows 
use method , cautious one thing -- 
active dos session open time . 
close 
window , run dos session 
problem . 
btw , example -- grateful med , work 
problem ver 1.3 

phone script files : 
documentation accompany phone , provide good instruction 
write script file get phone dial slip server 
university minnesota server . 
example script 
use dial cisco server university attend . 
background : start slip connection , dial terminal server , 
login username password . 
, start slip 
session follow command `` slip . 
'' , 
follow password -- .

use packet driver phone ? 
quick answer -- `` clean '' way . 
batch file 
hack write use phone packet driver . 

example , packet driver peter 's . 
use 
batch file like , must know parameter 
plan use packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector , baud rate , 
port address , irq . 
batch file require , 
, directory 
path ... 
batch file let dial slip connection 
use phone , load appropriate packet driver , hangup 
connection , unload driver ...
