would suggest take car nearest chevron dealer , 
oil filter . 
ask oil change . 
cost less 
$ 10 . 
watch . 
watch someone job , 
able learn remember sequence , right 
next time . 
besides , loosen 
drain nut , next time around easier . 
stick , use impact wrench . 
much force though . 
use new washer time put nut back ...
