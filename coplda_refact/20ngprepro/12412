assume guess assume energy 
event ^ 2 law . 
, ^ 2 law incorrect assume 
unknown material dark matter ?? 
inhibit gamma ray propagation , 
could possible actually see much less energetic 
event happen much closer ? 
even distribution could 
cause characteristic propagation distance gamma ray 
shorter thickness disk galaxy . 
believe problem theory see gamma-ray 
source energy range energy seem 
significantly absorb .
