yea , think also . 
israel 's # 1 issue `` security '' outcome 
`` negotiation '' certainly need address isreal 's perception 
issue . 
problem define `` outsider '' , israel , arabs 
# 1 issue arab side . 
`` palestinian 
statehood '' , israel state must 
allow exist , existence self-governing non - 
muslim `` state '' `` islamic world '' intolerable ... ? 

divide line - 
often hard discern `` outsider '' especially arab 
world , rationale behind - 
could either base visceral rejectionism sense 
wrong still value peace , know . 
anyway , talk , `` gesture '' would think would see 
israel `` substantial '' ?
