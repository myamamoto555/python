one era statistic 
: pitcher . 
say ?? 
era indicate average number earn run attribute pitcher per 
nine inning game . 
thus , pitcher pitch 3 inning give 1 earn 
run , 9 inning perfomance would 3 earn run , thus era 
3.00 . 
compute era simply take number earn run divide 
inning pitch multiple result 9 . 
era 9 
earn run run give pitcher attribute 
fielding error . 
specifically , error occur represent 
third , run score error consider unearned run . 
earn run also run score result player leave base 
pitcher exit game . 
example : 
two inning man base . 

error occur represent third , run 
error count earn run . 
pitcher issue base ball walk , leave game 
inning complete , responsible people 
leave base . 
runner leave base score , 
score result error , eran run 
attribute pitcher leave game . 
hope explain thing .
