last night , boston red sox win 11 game 14 game beat seattle 
5-2 . 
roger clemson pitch dominate . 
walk least 6 man 
first 6 inn . 
greenwell hit homerun red sox prevail . 
clemens struggle control , also `` beneficiary '' 
pretty shoddy umpiring . 
fair , walk 
early game , adjust . 
also help dare say 
? 
pretty good defense sox , include rivera play 
second , normal position . 
actually , clemens pretty lucky get win , consider sox 
almost give lead bottom 7th mo 's error catch 
. 
think game must win red sox seattle , consider darwin 
face seattle ace randy johnson tonight . 
must win ? 
april ? 
already win 4 game far anyone think would 
point season ... hope people get catch 
streak ; fun , team 11-3 streak time , 
start season get 
much attention .
