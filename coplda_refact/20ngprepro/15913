assume refer standard pot ground start line : 
look loop start line idle condition , ring 
conductor one approximately -48 -52 vdc respect 
ground tip conductor near ground potential sure 
reference telco ground take measurement . 
deal ground start line idle condition , ring 
conductor one approximately -48 -52 vdc tip 
conductor would look like float may see potential 
line capacitance bleed time . 
remember use telco 
ground reference make measurement .
