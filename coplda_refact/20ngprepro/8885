oh , yeah . 
dave winfield -- marginal player . 
guy hit lick , 
negligible power , crap fielder stay power . 
dave winfield , 
enter believe 20th big league season , still damn decent 
hitter . 
admittedly , defense slip great deal , prime , 
powerful arm great range . 
take look stats : 
know even begin make argument winfield kingman 
similar player . 
kingman power hitter -- could field , 
run like anvil , hit low average though , remember right , 
obp hideous ... , consider thing important 
. 
eddie murray ? 
yup , best 1st baseman 80 's . 
know 
mvp vote conduct , give get job 
mvp deserve 1983 , seem overrate media . 
lee smith ? 
hmmmm ... one 's actually pretty close . 

solid , dependable career closer despite pitch nasty park 
wrigley , fenway ... . 
would take closer look stats 
, seem lee arthur hof caliber . 
make legitimate point hof credentials reliever , 
simply rack lot save mean whole hell lot 
blow bunch , . 
simply minnesota boston month 
atlanta use reardon closer longer one , 
equalizer rack impressive number save . 
way 
hof , . 
darrell evans ? 
nice career , actually bit underrated kinda like 
ted simmons , , hof ` er .

big deal .

stop hand honor 
> liberally . 
save guy really deserve . 
face , something 
, wait goddamn minute . 
ozzie smith absolutely redefine 
position shortstop . 
defense good win something along 
line 10 gold glove . 
, gold gloves , 
good argument could make larkin deserve one two ozzie 's 
recent award , usually , temper someone else early 
80 's get gold gloves ozzie deserve earlier career . 
ozzie 's 
offense , ask ? 
good obp , great speed number , park , 
career , depressed offense , admittedly , power ` cept tom niedenfuer 
, still , definite asset offensively . 
yount ? 
3,000 hit , mvp two different position , uh-huh , real 
stiff . 
'82 one great year ever player recent memory , 
probably rank behind peak season wagner banks , far 
ss number go . 
clear hof ` er , . 
> , little prestige hall fame anymore . 

> certain individual believe steve garvey jack morris potential 
> candidate , absurdity apparent . 
gee , guy even compare 
> likely future hall famers like kirby puckett nolan ryan ? 
well , far garvey go , right . 
garvey `` '' 
candidate , push `` win attitude '' minor factor , one 
, `` great defense '' error , admittedly , range 
tree stump ... . 
garvey hof . 
? 
say lot nasty thing last 
year , mostly response woofer talk 
morris ' `` ability win '' nothing morris ' `` ability 
pitch toronto score ton run '' . 
point , morris 
average pitcher although early return ' 93 , may damned 
close . 
. 
, fairness , morris dominant pitcher 
80 's up-and-down tiger team . 
1984 obviously great year 
detroit , rest decade , team generally contention , 
favorite . 
morris ' career number quite good , worthy hof 
`` consideration '' . 
ryan ? 
course , careful . 
guarantee someone 
throw back earlier logic `` yount smith shortstop 
hang around long time '' . 
, nolan never win cy ... damn , 
pitcher hang around 99 year ... w-l record mediocre ... 
course , nolan 's hof ` er ... 
puck ? 
probably , although get play reasonably well 
year 10 year , even good one , enough make hof , 
likely . 
say , believe puckett make hof , pretty much 
regardless rest career turn bar something really 
tragic sudden . 
popular media fan , 
legitimately one best cf 's game since join 
league . 
always like guy , hope make . 
, 
end , think puck make . 
, really , early sell . 
debate come rather frequently net , , believe 
, never tire . 
interesting subject . 

top head list potential hof ` ers team . 
probably 
leave couple guy , feel free follow . 
consider anyone 
start play 1985 , early tell . 
note : 
active player , count recent retiree 
baltimore : cal ripken lock , even gehrig 's record stand 
boston : roger clemens might lock already , amazing , dawson ? 
detroit : alan trammell lou whitaker possibility 
milwaukee : robin yount discuss earlier 
new york : wade boggs possibly , mattingly long shot 
toronto : paul molitor jack morris possibility 
kansas city : george brett lock 
minnesota : kirby early tell , winfield lock 
oakland : eckersley lock , mcgwire early , rickey lock , welch long shot 
texas : mighty nolan early consider canseco strange 
cubs : sandberg lock 
st. louis : ozzie lock , lee smith probably 
new york : murray almost lock , saberhagen obviously , get regain 
past form 
certainly , vince coleman , despite 'll tell 
los angeles : butler , strawberry , hershiser long shot . 
san diego : tony gwynn pretty good shot 
colorado : dale murphy good shot , ryan bowen see awake
