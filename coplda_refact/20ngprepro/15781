`` culture '' refer israeli , anti-zionist see 
complete denial entity 's right exist `` legitimacy '' . 
say islam right establish implement 
`` state '' include non-muslim , absolute , one-dimensional 
view culture regard issue `` state '' .

discuss regard issue hand . 
since issue center 
israeli culture , yet hear positive culture 
discussion .

agree . 
also feel culture feel confront 
another group wish see culture `` disassemble '' , first 
culture little choice try secure `` survival '' well 
maintain moral center . 
since culture turn away 
either matter survival value moral 
principle , virtually impossible job `` balancing '' . 
discuss israel 's fault `` crime '' without recognition 
circumstance reality face conscious decision base 
's political bias , honest empathetically open 
understanding situation . 
apply attempt 
paint palestinian movement `` bad '' dispense consideration 
reality face .

beg question center symptom issue 
`` self-hating '' address motivation . 
certainly feel 
anyone expend much effort inflate , distort rob 
human context aspect culture reflect 
degree dislike . 
since bit culture bind , 
due upbringing , part , bit self - 
dislike seem likely mix somewhere . 

`` jew ?

, precisely israeli society tremendously harm 
action government feel take response 
`` '' perceive threat . 
, long 
strident emotional debate pain israelis feel 
force `` balance '' desire survival moral belief . 
trauma 
make choice make worse fact neither 
conveniently brush aside result reason political 
debate sake , reshape .

well know , process blame morally 
questionable action one side force `` '' , course 
take thoroughly practice side . 
hear 
pro-israeli crowd 's self-supporting argument , may due 
fact listen anything else .

agree , agree , agree , agree . 
however , response initial discussion davidsson 
oppose presentation , see davidsson carefully put 
academic frill around blatantly one-sided series - 
`` '' , , , . 
find approach 
oppose davidsson center denigration denial 
`` side '' . 
certainly wonder degree davidsson 's view 
middle east distort connect dislike rejection 
jewish lineage . 
say , however , agree 
constant accuse `` self-hating '' jew seem 
pointless . 
worse label `` , side '' , 
except perhaps imply certain degree overly enthusiastic 
.
