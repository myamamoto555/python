benedikt , 
recall anyone claim god - make - anyone act 
way , think attempt manufacture contradiction . 
god say require certain behavior , compulsion 
believer 's sense duty . 
standard conduct exist , 
free ignore misunderstand distort whatever 
way find convenient , response god 's edict 
way use question god 's existence . 
behavior believer 
completely separate question god 's existence ; 
nothing contradictory . 
say something define exist , really 
ask much ; would existence depend grammar . 

really say something poorly define , 
insufficient decide anything confusion course . 
point better reason phenomenon belief 
object belief may lead rat 's nest unnecessary 
complexity . 
think know imply , would like see 
version better alternative .
