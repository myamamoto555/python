drive 
: scsi device read write 720 kb 1.44 21 mb 
: disk . 
sound one great product pc market . 

: price really unaffordable compare cd-rom currently 
: rewritable ? 
know new rewritable cd expect sony 
: develop first md computer . 
question : 
: substantial interest develop ? 
certainly uk price 
cheap cd-rom seem able get around gbp 
200-250 . 
however bigger optical drive e.g. 128mb much 
expensive - around gbp 1000 mark . 
couple question someone may able answer - 
- direct drop replacement floppy 
need driver software etc. . 
i.e. rip floppy 
drive , plug cable , stick 
hey presto floppy . 
sound far easy . 
subject sony develop md computer , reread 
pcw article subject say sony 
optical drive people time may 
product . 
article seem audio md format 
byproduct computer storage work - md mechanism 
identical mo computer optical drive . 
sony spokesman 
quote say 2.5 '' md disk would hold 100mb datum 
though refuse comment possibility 
. 
article say one problem hold back development 
area lack sensible standard plus least 2 
distinct optical storage mechanism around present . 
give 
probably need md use distribution medium get 
market since already corner cd 
probably need someone come strong lead 
get md accept .
