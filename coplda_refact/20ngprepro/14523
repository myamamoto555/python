misleading , best . 
question , really , 
status greek septuagint versus hebrew scripture . 
issue 
predate reformation quite bit -- jerome negative 
`` '' fact , even though , put 
hebrew canon reorder greek order 
hebrew one . 
translation , also 
report one one day , another overnight , 
dictate translation amanuensis . 
say , vulgate , massive importance 
western christianity , along veneration jerome , take 
first step `` reduce '' book status 
among greeks . 
furthermore , inaccurate say reformers `` throw '' 
book . 
basically , place secondary status jerome 
already , additional warning doctrine 
base citation alone . 
think emphasis hebrew original sound , though 
seem somewhat arbitrary disallow face translation 
part collection whose principle selection hebrew greek 
confuse unknown likely fraught accident . 
also seem 
play tendentious notion original language somehow 
`` inspired '' -- magical , convey message untranslatable 
-- translation , could hear god 's word jews 
greek german , english , ... . 
tendency seem get 
big boost _ solum scriptura _ protestantism , even point current 
`` inerrancy '' bizarreness , despite basic , underlie tendency 
reformers see text could translate . 

profit english rendering hebrew greek , 
surely little reason keep sirach , least , bible 
course , anglicans . 
text originally greek , 
would seem prejudice notably , time 
hebrew canon fully attest , include anti-christian prejudice 
lead jewish abandonment septuagint operative . 
btw : reader may enjoy lecture bruce metzger issue 
translation bible include say jerome , 
current number journal _ bibliotheca sacra _ ; two 
four publish far .
