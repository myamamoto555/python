problem ture computer constantly due 
power surge start . 
due thermal fatigue . 
turn 
computer , heat , everything expand . 
turn , 
cool , everything contract . 
limited number cycle 
component take fail . 
modern electronics 
much robust respect . 
fact 
portable computer design mind since sleep function 
extend battery life also greatly number thermal 
cycle occur . 
rule thumb , go use 
computer include monitor next 4-6 hour , turn 
always dim monitor use prolong life 
phosphor . 
tend think pace technical innovation 
computer industry much less concerned fatigue 
life equipment concerned long particular 
architecture support hardware software vendor .
