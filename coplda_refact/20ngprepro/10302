mass rights individual , 
everything come individual one instance another . 

draw analogy , norway involve eec . 
usa involve 
nato . 
eec require certain change law . 
nato require 
change usa law . 
law affect citizen , hence 
norway say europe important , say , norwegians 
motorcycle make . 
usa , would likely tell 
eec get stuff since eec business , eye , 
tell much horsepower safely ride . 
note 
state government often play game federal 
government , essence cultural difference .
