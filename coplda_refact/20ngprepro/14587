think transmission fluid change solve problem . 
unless extremely cold climate use heavy weight 
fluid . 
follow manufacturer 's recommend oil weight . 

car standard transmission 4 5 speed recommend 
change transmission fluid 30,000 mile normal driving 
condition . 
go 100,000 without change transmission oil 
replace transmission bearing ! 
. 
older car use 85 weight 
oil whereas 92 honda use 10-30 motor oil maybe 30 weight .
