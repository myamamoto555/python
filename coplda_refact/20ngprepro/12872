definition `` interfere fielder take throw '' ? 
rule book certainly clarification , 
possible interpret rule say catcher alter 
throw avoid hit , interference . 
know , seem way apply rule justly -- 
catcher pitcher , say rob dibble , example throw toward first 
hit runner run inside baseline , fielder take chance 
eject . 
therefore probably would throw around runner 
scenario . 
note american legion league , use mlb rule 
interpret rule say circumstance interference 
per rule 7.09 .
