say theism factor . 
#the point theism factor . 
claim ; back . 
consider argument useful 
following : belief strongly correlate fanaticism . 
therefore 
belief factor fanaticism . 
true , utterly useless . 
note , 
belief , belief god

please note especially 
theism , leader believe say . 
believe , incredibly naive .

's straw man . 
usually discussion one 
: read write : every theism lead 
, cause theism . 
point , 
correlation , come innate feature theism . 
, come feature theism common 
fanaticism . 
last statement simply imply 
say , try sneak `` innate feature 
theism '' . 
word grope `` '' . 
, way , one . 
shit , sherlock . 
talk gullibility instead theism , 
since seem whole lot relevant case , oppose 
case try make ? 
say go forbid religion another straw 
. 
interesting nothing better offer . 
say read like warm . 
irrational 
bogus tirade , use create nice 
split mind excitable people find either 
side church wall .

's bogus . 
self reference circular . 
since evaluation 
possible within rational system , allow . 
o.k. , oval . 
still beg question , however . 
though 
certainly allow , rational . 
claim 
rational . 
risk repeat , hearing `` '' 
hear _ refutation _ , back . 
deal : 
use reason demonstrate reason useful . 
someone 
think reason crap buy , see . 
argument silly prove mathematical statement need mathematics 
mathematics circular . 
anybody else think godel silly ?

speak religious system contradictory definition 
god . 
# 
axiomatic datum lend rational analysis , say 
often refute fallacy . 
look discussion 
choice . 
, one evaluate axiom larger system 
usually derive . 
`` exist '' derive , want 
way . 
# 
, one test consistency set axiom . 
# 
try say ? 
point , people always wind say `` datum reliable '' 
particular reason . 
example : `` dream '' .

traditonal definition god . 
personal , supernatural entity 
objective effect world . 
usually connect moral 
#the way world work . 
imo , belief god necessarily irrational . 

mean people hold principle oppose exercise 
intelligence . 
atheist also scientist , example .

formalise argument ? 
# 
believe system b becuase sound nice . 
make 
#b true , best work hypothesis . 
however , content b 
true work hypothesis . 
test evaluate 
therefore dismiss b already believe 
wrong waste time possible . 
depend 
b kill , 
interesting effect . 
peculiar definition interesting , sure . 
show belief 
god entail contents speak . 

catholic neighbor kill protestant , example ? 
maybe 
believe . 
maybe conjunction `` b assert b '' 
`` dissenter '' important , belief god 
entirely irrelevant . 
certainly seem , 
axe grind .
