`` official line '' teach rider education class 
refer , also teach countersteering , 
question quality class . 
`` official line '' msf 
curriculum describe . 
maximum brake achieve apply 
brake equally , weight distribution nominally even 
tire equal normal force , ease rear 
prevent lock , increase brake front , 
traction available front due increase normal force due 
weight shift . 
`` official line '' teach seem ineffective face 
. 
apply rear brake front take advantage 
traction available rear time 0 , halve 
available brake power use front time 0 . 
say , `` brake tire begin slide '' next useless 
advice newbie . 
go slide tire find 
! 
also give zero information 
develop brake technique change brake 
corresponding weight shift develop .

necessarily true . 
`` chirping '' tire indicate impending lockup 
surface , serve good guide newby indicate 
maximum brake . 
agree totally lock front occasionally 
make one better rider , best save 
experienced rider , unless one outrigger bike like 
code use use .

true , point view best teach ride skill 
discussion start , `` keep wheel 
point slide '' nearly useless information . 
need teach 
technique , least strategy , achieve .
