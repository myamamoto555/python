except size , cooling tower nuclear power plant 
identical construction operation cool 
tower design build 1890 's hundred year ago 
coal fire power plant use lighting early electric railway . 
, cylindrical tower support rapid air draft 
air heat hot water steam circulate thru network 
pipe fill lower tower . 
assist cooling 
draft , water mister add spray cold water 
hot pipe . 
cold water evaporate , remove heat faster 
air flow draft would result water vapor 
rapidly carry away draft . 
produce cloud frequently 
see rise tower . 
slight pinch maybe way tower 
produce significant increase strength rate 
air draft produce , compare straight cylinder shape . 
tower use steam seal steam 
system power plant recirculate back 
boiler use . 
wider temperature difference across 
turbine use power plant 
steam cooling tower send 
back boiler maintain wide temperature difference 
sometimes high 1000 degree first stage `` hot '' 
turbine final stage `` cold '' turbine .
