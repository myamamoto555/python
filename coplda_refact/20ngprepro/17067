summary : result clock modification poll 
keyword : , clock , poll 
poll conduct help user decide whether alter 
clock oscillator . 
attempt gather many case history 
possible find estimate success risk . 
number reply 
probably show rare modification give impression 
success rate may higher previous 80 % estimate . 
24 24 
machine able run 25 mhz add board present . 
scientific survey best work . 
thanks contribute poll . 
issue : 
speed 25 mhz 27.5 mhz appear norm machine without 
add card . 
report machine able use 
25 mhz long add card present . 
several apple 
nubus card use . 
machine nubus adapter 
able go faster 25 mhz . 
one even able 
achieve 25 mhz nubus adapter place 
speed 32 33 mhz , startup sound distorted 
hi density floppy disk problem report . 
note : unless specifically list , machine 
test higher speed clock failure . 
hence , 
25 mhz operational machine may well work 
higher speed . 
damage one user report pull plating one pad . 

repair machine operational . 
one 
report pull pin original clock oscillator 
. 
one second hand report user 
put gash motherboard slipped soldering iron . 
report static discharge damage . 
report high speed operation cause damage . 
, also report user 
defective parachute . 
add board compatibility appear problem apple nubus 
adapter . 
several add board use 
success . 
see case history 
heat sink virtually modify machine heat sink install . 
often style power transistor type . 

use epoxy . 
use dab heat sink compound dab 
cyanoacrylate glue . 
also use clamp 
bolt hole motherboard . 
case histories : 
speed effective cpu speed clock oscillator .
