think little inaccurate , base feynman 's account 
process standdown . 
fred basically 
correct : sophisticated tool , lot effort painstaking 
care . 
get one right challenger ; feynman cite 
software people exemplary compare engine people . 

also note software people start feel management 
pressure cut corner , give much yet . 
among thing , software people work hard get thing 
right major pre-flight simulation , consider failure 
simulation nearly bad in-flight failure . 
result , number failure could count 
one hand , number in-flight failure zero . 
fred mention elsewhere , apply flight software . 
software run experiment typically mostly put together 
experimenter , get nowhere near level tender loving care . 
none experimenter could afford .

work one man 's work .
