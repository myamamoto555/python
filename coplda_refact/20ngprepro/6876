yeesh , nail . 
may suggest get 
mitt siemens ? 
unit design take big 
current pulse get duty cycle bit . 
output 
nearly watt 975 mw real short duty cycle time . 
nice thing cheap . 
get mine 
50 cent piece , even though buy 100 ... 
btw , see output 6 watt ... honest , 
6 watt . 
book work recall company 
name . 
6 watter cheap , around $ 108 want power , 
, pretty hot . 
also 4 watt , 2 watt 
1 watt device line , sell small quan . 
individual . 
interested , find book home get 
pertinent info . 
, position detector , might try florida . 
phone number list . 
seem like 
nice people . 
specialty passive infrared detection device , 
might able help . 
curious application mind say . 
device sound like could useful game , although would 
need carrier signal concept 58.8 khz ... .
