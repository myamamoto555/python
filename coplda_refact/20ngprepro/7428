scientist nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory report 
successful flight balloon carry instrument design 
measure study chemical earth 's ozone layer . 
april 3 flight california 's airport 
reach altitude 37 kilometer 121,000 foot take 
measurement part program establish correlate datum 
upper atmosphere research satellite . 
datum balloon flight also compare 
reading atmospheric trace molecular spectroscopy 
experiment currently fly onboard shuttle 
discovery . 
`` launch balloon several time year part 
ongoing ozone research program . 
fact , jpl actively 
involve study ozone atmosphere three 
important way , '' say dr. jim , principal investigator 
balloon research campaign . 
`` two jpl instrument uar satellite , '' 
continue . 
`` atmos experiment conduct jpl scientist , 
jpl balloon research provide collaborative ground truth 
activity , well datum useful 
right . '' 
measurement take balloon payload add 
piece complex puzzle atmosphere , specifically 
mid-latitude stratosphere winter spring . 
understand chemistry occur region help 
scientist construct accurate computer model 
instrumental predict future ozone condition . 
scientific balloon payload consist three jpl 
instrument : ultraviolet ozone photometer measure 
ozone balloon ascend descend atmosphere ; 
limb sounder look microwave 
radiation emit molecule atmosphere ; fourier 
transform interferometer monitor 
atmosphere absorb sunlight . 
launch occur noontime , follow three - 
hour ascent , balloon float eastward approximately 130 
kilometer per hour 70 knot . 
datum radio ground 
station record onboard . 
flight end 10 p.m.

`` need fly sunset make 
measurement , '' explain , `` also need fly 
darkness watch quickly molecule disappear . '' 
several week scientist
