documentation use shared memory extension 
distribution . 
actually , finish write motif animation program ... 
. 
use 
share memory , insert delay loop keep 
go quickly . 
test method side side , 
equal . 
advantage shm x server grow ridiculous 
size ; work network remove 
application die one tend use manually quite bit 
debug shm app . 
share memory also problem operating system e.g. 
ultrix seem allow small number segment ~ 6 
attach process ; consequently , redraw become 
; ; ; dec system . 
dec 's 24 
bit display like one tend use often seem 
support extension maybe someone compile wrong ? 
, use 
cause x server crash fail , one 
use local unix domain socket really bad ; one 
copy info three time per redraw instead one . 
short : allow three form display , within program 
good thing minus shm run network , let user pick 
whatever feel fastest . 
use class forget :
