would nice , rightly point inherent value 
freedom speech , discussion would also deal - 
frequent ritualized abuse distortion freedom 
occur . 
situation extremely vocal , 
usually radical , people drive people away , effectively stifle 
`` oppose '' view generally `` take '' . 
clearly , 
purpose behind action deprive 
freedom speech overt covert coercion domination 
`` media form '' question . 
`` freedom '' speech value , 
. 
would suggest sort problem 
alleviate ? 
particularly , control within 
structure newsgroup ?
