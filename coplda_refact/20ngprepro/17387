car magazine print lot information new mustang 
consensus believe `` car circle '' 
suspension piece tuning almost identical current 
cobra , stiffer body structure improve behavior . 
thunderbird cost weight debacle , ford decide 
independent rear suspension rear wheel drive try 
volume car . 
current 4.9 l v-8 soldier two year . 
version 
32 valve modular v-8 mark viii could offer . 
ford 
spend big money tooling 2.5 l 3.5 l v-6 engine 
power car immediate future , therefore probably 
consider volume production 300 hp v-8 engine priority . 
undisguised , car look ok , nearly exciting new 
, imo . 
suspect ford produce car higher quality gm 
achieve camaro firebird . 
way gm lose money , temptation 
`` get door '' sake positive cash flow 
great demand really take .
