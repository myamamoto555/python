course believe predestination . 
biblical doctrine 
romans show among passage . 
furthermore , church 
always teach predestination , begin . 
say 
believe predestination mean believe free 
. 
man freely choose course life , also 
affect grace god . 
however , unlike calvinists 
jansenists , hold grace , otherwise end 
idiocy deny universal saving god 1 timothy 2.4 . 
god must give enough grace save . 
elect , 
, receive grace final 
perserverance , guarantee heaven . 
mean 
without grace save , mean god 
obstinacy choose give , know would need 
, freely choose hell . 
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
people save save grace god , 
effort , god dispose , 
become saint . 
perish everlasting fire perish 
harden heart choose perish . 
thus , 
deserving god ; punishment , reject creator , 
sin working holy spirit . 
> yes , god judge . 
mete 
> punishment last judgement . 
well , would hold god certainly give everybody 
blessing good even little , 
bless next life , bless one . 

punish next life , chastise one 
purgatory sin . 
every sin incur temporal 
punishment , thus , god punish unless satisfaction make 
cf. 2 samuel , david 's sin adultery murder 
forgive , still punish death child . 

need point idea punishment god 's judgement 
quite bible . 
sodom , moses bar 
holy land , slaughter , saphira , 
jerusalem 70 ad , etc. . 
> jesus stop stoning adulterous woman perhaps 
> good parallel , go go anyway ,

> innocent ? 
stop slaughter innocent cf proverb , 
mean christian support war bosnia 
u.s. even u.n. involve ? 
think , 
isolationist , disagree foreign adventure general . 

case bosnia , frankly see excuse get militarily 
involve , would `` war . '' 
`` bless '' , `` 
peacemaker '' lord say , interventionist . 

action bosnia must peace , war 
unrelated anything justify .
