recall , 4.50 era 1st half 3.50 era 
2nd half last year . 
hmmm , 21 run 11 inning . 
suppose start 30 game , wind 
inning pitch . 
allow 4 run game next 189 
inning , 'll 4.75 era end year . 
think 
total right . 
go hard come back . 
jack may finish .

return form last year .

> $ 5 million contract awful lot eat ! 
1st hunch morris gutsy , may pitch 
injury tell anyone . 
2nd guess 
banish bullpen remainder season start . 
perhaps stewart come dl ? 
danny cox , go 3 4 
scoreless inning tribe today , start morris ? 
look like 
really good one . 
gaston scramble find starter , would imagine . 
luckily , jays good offense . 
think would dare release end year . 
'll replace stewart cox .
