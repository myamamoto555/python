simply belief mean . 
, seem christian teach think 
come religion . 
take extreme say 
religion one accept teaching 
`` save '' . 
take quite bit arrogance claim 
know god . 
especially base upon 
interpretation book . 
logic statement faulty 
assume two people differ belief 
correct . 
perception . 
two people exactly alike . 
two people perceive everything way . 
believe 
one truth . 
call god 's truth , universal truth , call 
. 
believe god present truth . 
think 
look see , prayer , 
meditation , - ation , dream whatever . 
people may 
perceive truth differently , mean one wrong 
right . 
example , take question , `` glass half 
empty half full '' ? 
two different answer 
contradictory yet correct . 
, belief 
true , require everyone else 's belief wrong . 
person believe convincing evidence god 
save christian , hard see criticize 
arrogance say . 
could wrong . 

hardly see arrogance . 
let 's look bit closer . 
suppose combination prophet messiah teach 
thing , say anything exclusivity . 
believe 
, add `` anybody believe anything else damned '' , 
could well criticize arrogance . 
case 
exclusivity message come prophet , etc. . 

could wrong believe , see 
call arrogant . 
maybe world soft place . 
maybe certain 
choice actually eternal consequence . 
see call 
christian message arrogant , certain sense though 
sense call law gravitation arrogant 
give option whether fall jump 
building . 
christian pass , give 
believe . 
complaint see make 1 christian 
wrong , 2 god arrogant .
