good . 
narrow . 
, narrow . 
'll recall , 
nut advocate possibility tactical nuke militia 
weapon certain situation . 
possibly define 
weapon start . 
also intend law reflective 
modern practice five month five century road .

describe civilian reactor 
definition fail note energy consider . 
reactor 
blow steam explosion , majority energy still come 
fission fusion heat coolant . 
see 
worm ? 
last hear , ft. calhoun station 
north omaha , nebraska consider weapon . 
give 
breeder design block , easily envision 
reactor household appliance twenty year . 

prism design , operator input need reactor 
, unreasonable assume secondary side 
make equally automatic future . 
definition 
flaw respects already .

typhoid mary would likely fit bill sneeze . 

mind extrapolation , hiv-positive person also fit 
bill interact way stand chance 
spread virus . 
finally , manure pile mention fit 
definition , , say , release pet rattlesnake wild .

show gas use . 
example , 
perhaps would like rid hay field gopher . 
calcium carbide 
rock dissolve water produce gas . 

use welding , miner lamp , gas gopher , 
make carbide bomb illicit fishing . 
toss 
toilet leave light cigarette seat 'll see 
also weapon , like flammable substance . 
, miner lamp work , welding , 
still pesky gopher .

basis , sure see problem 
write law , write law abused 
extend beyond point good . 
'll give 
little hint : see manure pile farmer 's field 
road ? 
usa , weapon mass destruction , 
> nope . 
consider weapon . 
propose law . 
silage pit 
run-off . 
underground fuel tank . 
biological 
nature , get wash open well contaminate 
aquifer supply thousand city drinking water . 
, 
draw line ? 
usa , epa rule 
pile scrap iron illegal . 
care draw thinner line time ? 
> define weapon mass destruction . 
many thing 
> ban reason . 
meet criterion weapon . 
instrument 
use fight , even though intended purpose , 
despite better weapon around . 
give aquifer 
supply significant part country drinking water , mass 
destruction rather give . 
certain weapon something would rather 
see lot people . 
problem nearly 
impossible write law abuse upon 
pretext another . 
looser definition , ripe 
abuse law . 
furthermore , get specific old 
standby insert clause allow list ban thing 
add , generally without go hassle another 
vote public reading law . 
, ripe abuse .
