worse current unsecure system ? 
become much 
worse , course , government use `` clinton clipper '' 
argue restriction unapproved encryption . 
main 
concern , think . 
camel 's nose tent , etc. .

wish could agree . 
ask . 
would private 
sector entity wish buy crypto system known least 
partially compromise ? 
key escrow instance would 
private sector entity wish buy crypto system properly 
evaluate ? 
i.e. publically release 
answer seem obvious , would . 
hardware 
compromise . 
des example triple des better one . 
suspicion price drop dramatically non clipper 
system . 
trouble . 
give clinton administration entirely stupid although would like 
think believe fail realize . 
know initiative fail , much cripple des never take 
seriously . 
way move work coercion . 
know 
little politics realize first step 
next move , make sense otherwise . 
next move , ban 
severly crippling crypto use `` clipper '' system easily 
justified `` would anyone want encryption unless try 
subvert government ? 
provide secure alternative 
use go . '' 
reconcile administration self proclaim purpose provide 
law enforcement access encrypted datum without make clipper system 
crypto available u.s. . 
. 
? 
simply , administration 
know . 
anyone want keep govt . 
hair , 
drug dealing whatever , would buy still available system . 
sell crafty clinton type short , stupid . 
either ban non clipper crypto next answer administration 
collective i.q. potato . 
think at&t jump fast ? 
know go big , 
better . 
right face , noone buy 
stuff . 
at&t must know , think man , 
hell would jump gun ?

sir madam : 
must object strongly administration evolve position encryption 
cryptography . 
shock clinton regime increase lean towards authoritarian approach regard privacy freedom government oversight day day life . 
apparent draft `` clipper chip proposal '' , incidentally , gain notoriety `` big brother proposal '' either incredibly ignorant sly indeed . 
anyone knowledgeable nuance cryptographic development research must understand key step development new algorithm , especially one destine standardization , full disclosure algorithm private academic sector . 
proper evaluation algorithm dep 
end careful scrutiny sector , scrutiny provide true public confidence security algorithm . 
assumption new algorithm accept base assurance `` expert '' without full disclosure plain ignorance . 
addition , assumption algorithm marketable technology , des , characterize key escrow lunacy . 
seem easy step logic chain probable consumer prefer purchase equipment cripple government key escrow , matter `` tamper proof '' key escrow might . 
believe even least educate policy maker would fail realize flaw . 
assume drafter `` clipper chip proposal '' know well difficulty sell cripple system private sector . 
way proposal make sense , chance succeed coercion . 
even language proposal make painfully clear next logical step outlaw encryption device hardware 
lize `` big brother chip . '' 
unfortunately public large educate enough issue realize lose . 
expect big brother proposal encounter little resistance american people efficiently dupe pretty word like `` harmony , '' `` right encryption , '' `` voluntary . '' 
mortify phrase seem use often characterize clinton administration `` believe happen . '' 
startling question colleague mine pose realization everyday become relevant ; `` reichstag fire plan ? '' 
concerned ,
