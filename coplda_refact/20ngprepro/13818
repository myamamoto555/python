p.s. ever read nietzsche ? 
greatest likely remembered five hundred year hence . 
must admit make many personal favorite 
great . 
make comment except remark 
immanuel kant . 
interpret cryptic remark 
please .

read enough either comment , although 
> everyone tell read . 
would say `` greatest philosopher '' title would 
go plato since whole enterprise philosophy essentially 
define . 
although get answer wrong , 
definitively identify important question . 
think 
descartes say `` philosophy footnote plato . '' 
choose philosopher make important advance 
human knowledge lifetime , simple ... aristotle . 
much case many simply refer `` philosopher '' . 
regard nietzsche , one entertaining , although since 
idea fragmented since life cut short doubtful 
influence philosopher likely extensive 500 year 
. 
'll probably still read 500 year though . 
`` modern '' philosopher , would say kant 
influential since strong influence almost everyone 
come unfortunately , maintain error 
amplify time . 
would say influential `` american '' philosopher would 
dewey . 
question philosopher highly regard 
500 year , may well ayn rand every important respect 
`` american '' , bear russia . 
guess remain see .
