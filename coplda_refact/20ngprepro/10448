yes , agree . 
try point , matter faith 
i.e. tenet logically persuasive , one may convince 
truth certain thing , instance , personal 
revelation . 
certainly fine share revelation 
belief . 
think arrogant , , 
accept matter pure faith truth oneself . 
think 
conflict arise assume , disagreement belief 
arise , must give truth , god 
must reveal truth everyone way would 
honestly agree . 
think lead conclusion anyone 
disagree sinful dishonest ; 
reject something know truth inconvenient 
, wish spurn god . 
would say equivalent assume truth one 
hold universal absolute . 
problem see 
negate individuality human relationship
