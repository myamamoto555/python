... 
enough christian glass , vary sufficiently 
broad range color , find support 
example . 
, michael , conservative christian also take gospel 
seriously . 
differentiate way interpret 
gospel .

... 
opinion , make michael radical fully 
acknowledge christian scripture tradition fail 
determine doctrine many branch within christianity 
hold dear . 
willing live practice religion 
within indeterminacy , willing acknowledge 
much understanding thing christian influence 
idea purely christian . 
christian 
call conservative must also interpret , 
recognize -- least , unwilling admit -- extent 
importance .

michael tradition . 
idea tradition 
> include , change idea tradition ! 
recognize michael part tradition . 

tell one tradition cover origen , aquinas , jerry 
, jesse jackson also include michael siemon ? 
much ! 
... short , principle make 
michael 's christianity beneficial , suspect would 
beneficial , perhaps moreso , without filter 
christian interpretation . 
> conclusion follow , even short , 
> argument go . 
surprising logical ellipsis . 
think conclusion follow . 
purely christian 
principle michael one share 
christian tradition derive christian 
scripture . 
, necessarily vague , enough drive 
political stance . 
one love one 's neighbor 
purely christian principle . 
mean show tolerance 
homosexuality . 
political stance , often odds 
commonly hold current christendom , 
suspect could better press outside . 

hand , well understand counterpoint , 
political stance become influential present 
need .
