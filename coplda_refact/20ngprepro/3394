see people expect boston finish sixth . 
bottom four 
team last year essentially tie . 
boston , seventh place , 
73 win . 
yankees indians , tie fourth place , 76 win . 
think obvious red sox improve 
indians tigers . 
basically , red sox stronger year 
1b , dh , ss , lf , rf . 
healthier start pitcher 
far , least better reliever . 
see reason 
win ~ 85 game . 
meanwhile , indians shambles 
tigers still pitching . 
win 20-3 
blowout , lose awful lot 7-5 game . 
maybe sox play poorly , win 78 game , finish fifth . 
think third fourth place likely . 
cheers ,
