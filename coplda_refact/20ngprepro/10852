afraid work either . 
pick laptop screen without 
problem . 

so-called ` low radiation ' monitor also useless . 
description 
turn marketing assertion rather engineering one . 

think might market monitor hugely 
expensive military tempest kit , well enough shield 
stop eavesdropping use available receiver . 
build prototype , work , 
still sit lab bench . 
commercial interest exactly zero . 

absence open standard , monitor really ` low radiation ' 
cost 500 dollar compete monitor 
claim ` low radiation ' whose extra cost production 
pretty blue sticker box .

yes , laptop still read , quite 
easy normal pc crt .

pick surveillance equipment , point , would lot 
cheaper mask remain signal tempest technique .
