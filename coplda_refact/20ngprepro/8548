hga reflective wavelength might `` cook 
focal element '' , figure good scale -- problem 
antenna _ _ could expose sunlight , 
lest like icarus ' wing melt . 
think glue , well 
electronics , worry .

furl axis _ always _ pointed near sun , small 
sunshade tip antenna mast would shadow fold hga . 
larger sunshade beneath antenna shield spacecraft bus .
