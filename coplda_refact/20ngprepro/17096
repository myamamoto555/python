hearing instruments . 
would appreciate comment 
` new ' technology hearing aid . 
resound system develop basis research at&t 
appear take different approach aid . 
appear 
new ` programmable ' aid like use flexible 
programmable version classical approach amplify part 
spectrum add compression try help 
` noisy ' situation . 
major difference resound approach divide 
spectrum low high frequency splitting point programmable , 
apparently base fact lot vowel information find 
low frequency , important consonant information 
unfortunately high frequency . 
two band 
treat different compression scheme . 

also develop new fitting build call 
` abnormal growth loudness ' . 
latter interesting fit personal experience , though 
think phrase . 
appear case 
exceed minimum threshold person hearing loss , deficit 
become less compare normal time reach 
` loud ' point sensitivity curve appear converge . 
mean 
boost sound level , overload high 
end people hearing loss . 
hence want progressively 
less amplification signal get closer maximum tolerable point . 
want boost low volume sound high potentially 
differently low high frequency part spectrum specially 
someone like relatively normal 1000 cp fall 
cliff . 
aid simple compressor energy low 
high frequency therefor ` compress ' useful high frequency 
information high volume low frequency component . 
particularly impressive resound performance whisper speech 
simulated restaurant noise situation .
