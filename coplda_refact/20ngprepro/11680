think agree paul kind 
activity could name `` fornication '' `` theft '' `` covet '' 
`` revile '' `` drunkenness '' would well deserve condemnation .

make clear , leave matter rather decision , 
uncomfortable dominate 
christian discussion area . 
homosexual behavior different . 
gay christian 
know adamant condemn rape -- heterosexual homosexual -- 
child molestation -- heterosexual homosexual -- even possibly 
`` harmless '' obsessive kind sex -- heterosexual homosexual -- 
would stand condemn paul continuation chapter

well , . 
? 
almost slimey argument 
one homosexuality rape . 
know one argue seriously 
though one always find joker `` defense '' bestiality . 

absolutely irrelevant incomparable issue gay christian 
raise concern sexual activity within commit , consensual human 
adult , bring relevant
