talk witness 
accident , otherwise directly involve e.g. , paramedic , 
emergency room doctor , etc. , use 
first trial .

forget call witness . 
talk new expert witness offer new 
interpretation datum , note loser always find 
witness . 
grounds new trial , loser 
could always get new trial , keep loser 
become winner side would come new 
expert witness .
