watch televise trial , answer 
statement make defense atty , prosecutor 
object , judge tend sustain one obviously 
fall `` self-incrimination '' type objection . 

quite bit trial use graphic 
language , folk ask judge want hear 
exact language . 
practically every time defense try get 
plaintiff `` '' ask question , 
objection sustain . 
one point defense manage get quip 
`` solicitation felony '' judge say `` sustained '' 
prosecutor could get objection state .
