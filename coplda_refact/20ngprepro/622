serum , actually , plasma number . 
whole blood 
number human tend somewhat lower roughly 5 10 
percent lower . 
find follow range whole blood

obviously measure whole blood 
indeed , measure whole blood level , although 
accurate serum test laboratory . 
one problem 
cell sample continue metabolize glucose 
sample draw , reduce apparent level . 
accord , 
however , result compare `` reasonably well '' laboratory result , 
although `` value 80 mg .

state , whole blood level tend roughly 5 10 
percent lower serum level . 
sample freshness affect 
whole blood level , however . 
believe well - 
define `` conversion factor , '' since cell metabolism affect 
sample vary degree . 
test much 
prefer except general `` ball park '' testing . 
- rich young kodak 's opinion .
