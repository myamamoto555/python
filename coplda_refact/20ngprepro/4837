well , since oilers win heck lot game , sure 
deserve mvp `` win without '' . 
however , would suggest kelly 
buchberger instead dave manson , brutal year , pick 
all-star game notwithstanding . 
biggest surprise , would say buchberger higher expectation 
year due `` breakthrough '' year last year , 
really raise game . 
suggestion would shjon podein , one 
callup cape breton year . 
quite far 
depth chart oilers stable prospects , make big impact 
team . 
12 goal 33 game -1 . 
decent 
number player seemingly doom minor-league 
oblivion . 
oilers coaching staff liken style john tonelli . 
think 'll full-time roster next year . 
biggest disappointment , could name player oilers 
dump lousy production year nicholls , gilchrist , tikkanen 
even shayne corson , mellanby far .
