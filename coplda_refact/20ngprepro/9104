mistaken , usual sort precaution loss 
communication . 
timer count continuously ; ever hit 
zero , mean galileo hear earth suspiciously long 
time may galileo 's fault ... time go fallback 
mode minimize chance spacecraft damage maximize chance 
restore contact . 
know exactly galileo 
situation , common example switch receiver , theory 
maybe one listen die .
