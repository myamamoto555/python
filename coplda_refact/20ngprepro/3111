agree . 
quite likely , actually . 
... believe `` jesus 
'' originally context baptism . 
folk 
believe baptism mention 
jesus , rather father , son , holy spirit . 
may 
doctrinal implication , far know mean 
folk deny existence divinity father . 

right one describe theology , fact think may 
several , include would classically call monophysite 
arian two rather different view , well belief 
probably consistent trinitarian standard , 
use trinitarian language misunderstand simply 
biblical .

biblical ? 
make end matthew ? 
jesus come say , `` authority heaven 
earth give . 
19 go therefore make disciple 
nation , baptize name father son 
holy spirit , 20 teach obey everything 
command .

. 
talk people reject trinitarian 
language unbiblical , speak trinitarian theology , thing 
like `` one three person '' . 
obviously three-fold 
baptismal biblical , point . 
normally use 
term `` three-fold '' refer mat . 
certainly 
consistent belief trinity , trinity doctrine whose 
full formulation occur 4th 5th cent 's . 
unlikely 
mat . 
mind trinitarian doctrine . 
indeed three-fold baptismal use group 
believe trinity . 
disagreement baptismal formula 
occur passage act 2:38 , command baptism 
name jesus . 
couple passage act 
well . 
leave sort problem : command mat . 
baptize name father , son , holy spirit , 
act baptize name jesus . 
`` jesus '' group baptize name jesus . 
consider 
consistent mat , say jesus name 
father , son , holy spirit . 
right one 
ask explain mean . 
simply say 
appear normal trinitarian theology . 
also odd way 
deal idiomatic phrase `` name '' . 
use three-fold seem standard 
answer passage talk baptize name jesus . 
suspect common explanation say `` name 
'' need verbal . 
say baptize name 
jesus may simply mean baptism jesus ' 
authority . 
1st cent . 
context , contrast christian baptism 
baptism john jewish baptism . 
course 
certain parallelism passage . 
suggest 
could well say mat require specific 
three-fold use baptism , simply characterize 
baptism follow father , son , holy spirit . 
one might well suspect early church , one 
baptismal use . 
long consider follow jesus 
follow father , son , holy spirit , great 
damage would difference . 
mean 
think go back use formula . 
baptism one 
thing almost christian group recognize 
mutually , think something upset would 
interest gospel . 
reinforce fact 
group actually use `` name jesus '' seem 
mind difference doctrine . 
say , 
one explain doctrine .
