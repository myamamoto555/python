doubtless take jael 's slaying sisera type 
mary 's victory sin . 
even take deborah 's word 
apply prophetically symbolically mary , must still 
applicable literally jael . 
may well take mean 
god use part plan deliverance 
people , common mary . 

reason suppose mean sinless , thus 
reason take like expression apply mary proof 
sinless .
