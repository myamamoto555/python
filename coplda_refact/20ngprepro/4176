lines : 24 
point raise check actually - - chip , 
oppose allegedly program therein , raise yet another trust 
issue . 
even assume `` trust agent '' really enter 
wide range s1 s2 seed rather use one 
time reduce key search space 30 bit , assume 
pick iron filing poke circuitry 
carefully select point encode datum . 
would presumably 
punch number computer , know could program 
chip manner completely independent s1 s2 value 
feed system . 
s1 s2 clearly backdoor - assume 
compromise . 
, hell use 
hardware true random number source . 
random number 
source anywhere proposal . 
whole thing deterministic 
day serial number stamp chip . 
nope , trust . 
two level access - 
possibly honest key escrow police force use , 
ostensibly fbi ; back door let nsa decode everything 
fly - maybe fbi want 
warrantless tab exchange favor .
