work system use give set 3d key frame 
position x , y , z control imaginary camera movement . 

use spline describe siggraph ' 84 
proceedings create variable number inbetween 
key frame . 
want inbetween give form 
x , y , z , dx , dy , dz last three x , y 
z component view direction vector camera 
position x , y , z . 
method present bartels deal 
position inbetween view point generate . 
` ve 
try set view direction view point equal 
chord two adjacent view point general 
key frame , cause discontinuity 
view direction vector key frame position although 
spatial movement seem work fine ; quite certain 
- think - simply make implementation 
error ... 
wonder anyone use spline form 
similar purpose decide viewing vector . 
would appreciate reply email 

anyone else interested answer send summary 
reply contact .
