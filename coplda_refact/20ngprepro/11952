mike , 
see `` creation vs evolution '' several time 
question . 
either point view derive direct 
observation ; either scientific ? 
wonder whole 
controversy concerned consequence `` truth '' 
rather truth . 
side seem hold philosophical outcome , help 
wonder come first . 
point elsewhere , view 
human nature make believe way know 
objectively - knowledge inherently subjective . 
, 
context , would take stand base actually 
know true want true tell 
difference ?
