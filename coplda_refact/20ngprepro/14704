comment ? 
: 
agree . 
people mislead believe `` thus sayeth lord '' 
innuendo opinion speculation . 
speak directly . 
lord give something say , say . 
, declare `` thus sayeth lord '' , would better know certain 
without shadow doubt correct spiritual condition 
relationship lord receive prophecy absolutely 
certain , , without tiniest shadow doubt 
possibility mislead imagination hope gain 
recognition mislead wiles devil follower . 
mistake area costly dangerous . 
, greatest fear 
area would following : 
1 -- people would mislead 
2 -- people would lose respect christianity 
3 -- true prophecy would cloud false prophecy 
4 -- god call prophet misrepresent god 's word , 
call would lose forever . 
god 's word would command people 
never listen fear word would false prophet . 

bridge would burnt forever . 
perhaps could repent save , 
could never prophet god . 
light , critical speak lord say speak 
silent lord say silent lest deprive 
world god 's word hide bushel either inappropriate , 
cowardly silence false statement . 
, 
critically important remain close lord , word , 
prayer , fill spirit god know difference . 
day age , sinner spout mouth leave right judge 
one another , claim `` rights '' , deny rights 
indeed belong , demand equal respect `` god '' 
world , utter every form falseness promise make one feel 
good . 
time christian give example honesty stand 
contrast backdrop falsehood . 
say , `` thus sayeth 
lord '' , happen . 
pray , prayer answer pray right . 
say christian , really mean .
