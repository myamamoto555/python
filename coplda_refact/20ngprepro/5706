every city suburban police officer see around twin cities 
last two year carry semi-auto type different brand though 
see glock 's . 
regard discussion : get dangerously far usual 
ranting , close realm , would like put two 
cent worth . 
nothing wrong revolver especially 
large frame s&w .357 magnum - favorite valid advantage 
semi-auto . 
suggest read massad ayoob 's know , people stand 
think full bull , think general material 
valid useful book _ semi auto pistol police work _ something 
like . 
define number way semi-auto 's different , 
`` different good '' . 
main advantage increase firepower , 
accurate followup shot go single action mode . 
also 
certain `` nature '' gun take familiarity 
learn . 
may diminish time criminal become familiar 
different model semi-auto , cite stop least 
slow criminal grab police officer gun .

yes , best two hand hold . 
single hand either 
pull gun far target cock , must fire double action . 
da 
auto advantage plus always sa first shot . 
| > - misfire revolver merely mean must pull trigger 
| > rotate next round . 
sure mean different first point . 
da 
semi-auto pull trigger try drop hammer 
round - advantage revolver next trigger pull 
always go next round discuss point . 
fine dud 
situation ? 
grant rare , round 
go confine cylinder place go . 
slide 
misfire take little time .

actually modern revolver design incorporate hammer block 
necessary usually recommend . 
revolver would fall hard enough 
right angle actually break hammer driver firing pin 
round set . 
| > - revolver allow reload almost fast magazine 
| > semi-auto . 
faster depend user . 
best user , especially use spring load speed 
loader fast . 
problem eject spend case two 
hand job drop expend magazine one handed . 
mean 
insert fresh magazine soon old one clear 
gun , speed loader go motion always 
take time . 
also advantage tactical reload replace 
partial magazine bring back full capacity - partial magazine 
still use need later .

start anything

yes , time recognize problem important time clear 
. 
really though , either revolver semi-auto odds actual misfire 
factory ammo awfully small . 
likely get jam semi-auto 
even exceptionally rare modern quality gun sig , glocks , .

common semi-auto 's carry round chamber without 
safety problem . 
put statement believe , 
say apply one look . 
da 's 
different revolver situation : gun hammer firing 
pin block . 
also safety . 
real advantage 
carry one cock lock safety speed 
employment revolver , plus advantage sa followup shot . 

familiar sa semi-auto except . 
admit 
initially skeptical carry cock lock , examine 
design , try defeat safety gun unloaded course , 
shoot lot , see inherent safety problem , especially 
holster strap hammer . 
design also get 
speed accurate first shot revolver .

yeah , infamous glock . 
still figure worse revolver 
safety . 
pull trigger go . 
imagine 
revolver shooting double action could pull glock trigger 
far enough fire realize . 
addition , develop 
nasty habit keep finger trigger holster gun 
rely thumb hammer remind take blow 
foot would problem hammer .

poor man 's beretta taurus 99 consider inferior carry 
weapon springfield .45 oop , 9mm vs. 45 argument relegate 
. 
right , though . 
hit aim 
combination fail . 
ascribe failure 
fire real fast scenario mention gun . 

shooter failure , whether lack discipline lack training .

9mm 's become popular crook , though .38 still 
lead list . 
like say , around semi-auto 's seem rule 
street cop . 
know state patrol however , may still carry 
`` highway patrolman '' .
