acetone likely damage carpet . 
first solvent try denature 
alcohol . 
waste time rub alcohol . 
use methyl 
alcohol instead denatured alcohol . 
want cocktail 
remove goo , use pure grain alcohol . 
alcohol 
work try carbon tetrachloride . 
neither work may need 
try stronger solvent , alcohol work adhesive . 
good luck .
