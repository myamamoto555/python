lot discussion , far nobody seem hit 
exactly criticism `` arrogance '' aim . 
arrogance attack `` think one know 
absolute '' . 
short , many evangelical claim 
infallible matter religious text . 
particular , problem one epistemology . 
shorthand , 
think epistemology `` know ? '' 
question , turn , 
troubling one . 
problem ` absolute certainty ' , bottom , least 
thinking go inside head . 
unless certain 
everything happen head infallible , reasoning 
discover source truth question . 
mean absolute justification source 
authority -- mean absolute certainty . 
let 's take specific example biblical inerrancy , fictional 
name zeke . 
follow argument apply idea 
papal infallibility , . 
zeke , presume , spend time study bible , history , 
several topic . 
conclude , base study 
possibly religious experience bible source absolute 
truth . 
may correct ; even , certain correct . 
conclusion depend well study history -- may make 
mistake , reference use may contain mistake . 

conclusion depend well study bible -- may make 
mistake . 
conclusion depend reasoning -- may make 
mistake . 
notice common thread yet ? 
8 - 
everything study world -- everything 
happen head -- limit thinking . 
matter 
try cover mistake , never certain 
infallibility . 
long part belief base 
reasoning , belief consider `` absolutely certain '' . 
zeke believe find source absolute truth -- belief 
good quality search make . 
unless 
say reasoning flawless , conclusion doubt . 
belief hold absolute source truth depend part 
thinking -- way loop . 
infallible 
thinker absolute certainty belief . 
easy demonstrate . 
let 's go back shorthand method 
epistemology : `` know ? '' 
imagine hypothetical discussion : 
: bible source absolute truth . 
b : know ? 
: study history bible religious writings church 
teaching come conclusion . 
b : know study history correctly ? 
: well , everything . 
b : know correctly ? 
: well , compare answer smart people agree . 
b : smart guy believe something mean 
true . 
know study correctly ? 
: ... 
, see , b eventually get point say `` 
prove mistake '' -- long may make 
mistake , absolutely certain . 
way loop . 
`` arrogance christian '' arise : many people believe 
personal research give absolute certainty 
doctrine christianity -- implicitly claim 
infallible , possibility mistake . 
claim make mistake , thinking lead 
flawless conclusion , pretty arrogant . 

people want see argument explain great detail try 
find _ infallibility church _ , george salmon . 
attack 
idea pope infallible well , 
general argument apply equally well idea bible 
inerrant .
