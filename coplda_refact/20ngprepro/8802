agree jon say delete part , course , 
serious reservation advice . 
maintain ` 
friend ' level relationship much easier say . 
people 
usually end get hurt . 
especially likely happen 
start feeling attraction . 
people feel attract feeling cloud judgement . 
experience go quickly believe 
date non-christian believe date man would okay 
believe premarital sex fine people really love 
. 
relationship end belief immediately return 
original state . 
especially extreme case young away home 
fellowship . 
think would work exactly way 
people . 
however , important underestimate power 
feeling attraction .
