yup . 
jpeg viewer seem require specific video driver since support 
specific video card . 
standard ibm bio video support 
vga 256 color mode , leave card 
hercules monochrome card way give good picture 
quality dither work right . 
remember name jpeg viewer since usually convert jpeg 's 
gif 's view . 
require vesa driver video card . 
need special hardware view jpeg 's except perhaps vga 
card maybe 286 + processor . 
people day program 286 + 
computer neglect rest 86 processor 8086 , 8088 . 

8088 clone nec v20 processor hercules card , write 
program view gif 's animation vga 
color graphic board monochrome hercules card . 
use 
dither find one something neat color palette 
result dithered image give much greater detail normally would 
view monochrome system . 
8.50 f dither 
standard thing image palette dither , way 
give brighter detailed image . 
anyway , enough rambling wrong direction . 
final point , 
far know , need extra hardware view jpeg 's 
vga perhaps 286 better 
day !
