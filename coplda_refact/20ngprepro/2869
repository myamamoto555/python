perhaps 
question whether constitution might write appeal 
principle , rather , appear believe , write 
something else mind `` propoganda '' put supporter .

since u.s. constitution basis u.s. political 
system , change would require constitutional change .

tradition . 
make part constitution .

prime minister member parliament , although 
badly u.s. president . 
, please explain u.s. house representatives 
`` principle '' powerful house lords senate 
practice less . 
suggest writer 
constitution really intend powerful , gosh 
darn thing ratify realize would forget put 
extra restriction senate ?

entry level political science course tell 
, people want law implement always choose level 
government `` attack '' present best chance 
get want . 
national `` interest group '' simply 
rational thing want federal government enact 
law rather state . 
less people persuade , less 
`` contribution '' make . 
concern abortion primarily concentrate 
federal level ? 
simply win battle little 
state battlefield win extension . 
extend insurance , 
medicine , question . 
local government `` fail '' 
, dominate local interest . 
thus non-local 
interest want locality abide rule get 
rule past local government . 
thus , since get clout , 
wrong place , appeal next higher level 
impose lower . 
mean , let 's get real . 
really need congres 
united states decide x light thus - 
pattern ? 
carjack need federal oppose 
local crime ? 
people want congress take power `` sell '' 
vote . 
think rise `` special interest '' 
coincidence increase power congress .

bingo . 
higher governmental ladder less actual 
need matter , political power concentrate higher 
level , people less cloud find reduce 
effectiveness .

simply leave new york 's education new york ? 

remain state union capable 
educate child want . 

leave , worry `` pork '' 
state . 
since industry concentrate political power 
wealth , rather must divide among state try get 
want , individual voice relative impact . 
problem must `` buy '' 
state , congress acquire much power sell pork .

earth want redirect ? 
say 
sell pork get thing congress . 

less authority sell pork retain authority enact 
national legislation within grant jurisdiction , pork problem 
significantly reduce . 
> current block power simply absolve congress responsibility 
> come decision . 
current block essentially state inaction preferable 
action , thus system weight action . 
consider 
government usually institution sole power 
enforce decision force , consider bias make 
decision good thing . 
> push decision lower pyramid 
> work unless lower level less corrupt . 
case worse ,

difference lower pyramid 
legal , legitimate authority matter constitution 
federal government , b lower level power 
harder concentrate . 
c get benefit impose 
new everybody . 
get see try 
without national decision . 
congressional action usually treat 
entire country whole , yet even similar problem different 
area , different solution may call . 
often agree decision local 
state rep make , least better option go 
city council shooting mouth . 
would much rather 
majority law make accessible people hang around end 
put rather somebody far 
washington half million constituent . 
curious base assumption lower level 
corrupt .

phill , bring federalist papers . 

argue whether minority senator 
allow hold bill . 
claim senate 
suppose far less powerful house , contend 
nothing constitution writings indicate . 
bring decide founder 
want base federalist papers . 
argue , 
never argue . 
primarily refer constitution , 
place small restriction senate 
house .

u.s. constitution document . 

independence high-brow reasoning . 
couple 
example , though , reasoning power tax , 
reasoning power grant permit , article , section 8 . 
> veto mean exceptional measure follow

president mean revise legislation

furthermore

certain extend believe veto become something 
intend . 
however , also believe inevitable consider 
congress ' abuse power make bill say whatever 
want say . 
unlike people think worry 
veto , fine , problem congress 
almost necessitate abuse .

bush ? 
phill , absurd . 
bush 37 veto , one 
. 
go read fdr think 
anything resemble record .

? 
inherently wrong bias system 
action ? 
historically governemnt action u.s. 
deal issue bare minority large minority 
successful . 
position impose federal 
power diverse people , federal government 
get something bare majority

switch general question 
specific bill . 
see make difference . 
> change law presupposition favor 
> status quo arguable . 
sure arguable . 
' e argue . 
however , require 
60 % bring vote ensure 'll good 
argument . 
something base solely party line .

, completely happy system require minority 
action . 
since u.s. history history carve population 
group implement minority , feel minority 
sufficent clout prevent action feel strongly enough 
. 
41 % hardly tiny minority . 
advocate minority 
capable initiate see problem bias 
federal system action .
