continue failure obvious bit part 
much larger political agenda president clinton . 
would even 
suggest loss 4 atf agent inconsequential 
context political agenda . 
might even beneficial agenda , 
help point evil assualt weapon . 
proof 
might atf deny agent street stories report request 
sufficient fire power . 
important date : 
feb 25th - nj assembly vote overturn assault weapon ban . 
feb 28th - compound waco attack . 
feb. 25th new jersey assembly vote overturn assault weapon 
ban state . 
look like might tight vote , senate 
n.j. go vote overturn ban . 
would sit well 
eastern state overturn assault weapon ban , give clintons state 
agenda gun control . 
suspect clinton give order get someone 
group assualt weapon press present initially 
incident waco record event tv audience . 
agent 
`` street stories '' report supervisor urge `` get 
ready fast '' , `` know come '' . 
believe attack continue ,
