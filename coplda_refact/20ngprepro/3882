actual hourglass hollow design generate draft , 
exploit effect . 
around base hourglass 
ring water tower . 
warm river water , come steam condenser 
plant , spray louvre . 
draft pull 
tower cool water evaporation convection . 

sensible heat extract cooling water drive force 
draft generation . 
note hourglass-shaped cooling tower use 
nuclear plant . 
also note 
location water plentiful , cooling tower used part 
time , discharge temperature would exceed release limit . 
think warm discharge water damage fish . 
fisherman know thoroughly incorrect . 
nontheless , stringent , 
usually state , regulation remain instance . 
since typically 
take 60,000 hp worth pump move volume water need 
cool 1000 mwe plant , cost use tower insignificant .
