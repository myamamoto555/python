think couple way guarantee authenticity one-time 
pad scheme , though sure prove kind 
provide . 
obvious might truly random unpredictable 
eve block message , calculate crc include 
random start block message . 
could encrypt 
message . 
problem , sure impossible come 
message hash crc regardless random start 
block . 
intuitively seem like ought hard , 
sure ... clearly , hash like md5 sha would 
stronger , , sure comfortable claim 
unbreakable . 
scheme use pad bit decide many bit 0 's 
include plaintext stream go would bad , 
either . 
cost increase speed use 
pad , could use give arbitrarily low probability 
opponent could spoof message , since decipher plaintext 
spot carry 0 's show something funny 's go 
. 
, message bit , use one random bit , , decide 
whether insert 0 plaintext stream , would get total pad use 
2.5 time message length . 
would expand message size 
half . 
0 appear plaintext stream 
guess would-be . 
bit , guess . 
try 
see quantify chance make way 
spoof message , get little complicated , get un - 
synch , still happen 0 place spoofed message . 
, see simple way get secure 
one-time pad , cost use 4 time message length pad bit . 
message bit , , use one random bit , , xor together 
get . 
, encrypt three bit one-time pad . 
enemy 
way guess , guess , either . 
change make ciphertext stream involve guess 
. 
way without use many pad bit ? 
spoof message equivalent correctly guess many random 
bit bit message . 
clearly , make spoof message 
hard know whole message text know none . 
fact , look like make hard generate spoofed 
message ciphertext without , entirely sure 
. 
easier way provably secure 
one-time pad ?
