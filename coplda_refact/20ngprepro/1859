agree shai , many reference israeli 
plan litani river yet find hard 
evidence . 
mention report 
commission un study litani river , 
still draft form . 
israeli gov ' also commission 
study river dr. ben wolfe . 
litani start bekaa valley lebanon , 
flow southward , west across south lebanon 
discharge mediterranean near city tyre . 
river hasbani wazzani 
start lebanese territory join jordan river . 
mention plan one would divert water 
litani , water would flow 
naturally lac de houle . 
evidence 
diversion structure would need least 
3 km long . 
area mountainous , inaccessible 
occupy israel see independent 
report existence diversion structure . 
another often mention diversion deep well . 
also rumor 600 m well 
tap deep aquifer draw water 
israeli side border . 
well indeed 
use would costly operate 
high energy cost lebanese israeli gov ' 
agree distribution water share aquifer 
part overall peace plan bilateral 
`` regional issue '' . 
fact 
war time lead current state 
affair withdrawal aquifer 
completely unregulated .
