hus , 
read `` spaceflight handbook '' somewhere 
author discuss solar sail force act 
try gain initial acceleration pass close 
sun hyperbolic orbit . 
magnitude acceleration 
estimate order . 
also say may 
big problem man craft human publish 
1986 already withstand acceleration . 

long-winded 's question finally - acceleration 
fact humanly tolerable ? 
- aid mechanical device 
course . 
possible , use absorb acceleration ? 
extend larger acceleration ? 
thanks advance ...
