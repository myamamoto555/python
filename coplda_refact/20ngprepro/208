find little purpose 
manufacture . 
little cosmic sense . 
even 
greatest great pharo long go , pyramid historical 
oddity wear wind , eventually turn dust . 
mankind one day perish . 
without interconnectedness 
transcend physical , without god , pointless 
end . 
people able live , little 
purpose success , money , power , effect change , help 
suffice . 
suppose never think cosmic scale , 
least able put mind . 
, comforting know reality illusion . 

true reality underneath physical spirit . 
world 
school sort , learn grow , soul mature . 

give purpose little purpose , take pressure 
. 
necessary make life success human term 
really learn . 
important progress , 
grow , persist , learn love express 
love , especially dificult . 
honest effort reward 
god , know limitation . 
live forever god .
