get decide 
: threat ? 
base appearance ? 
would someone feel threaten 
: 
action determine whether someone present threat ... carry gun 
much people , cause tend fade , due 
several encounter formerly domestic dog ... critter scare 
folk , get aggressive . 
: stay see someone sit clean gun . 
softly back 
: away , hike another 5 mile get . 
'll freely admit : 
: afraid gun ; afraid people bring backcountry . 
: 
would count fear gun ... somebody sense keep 
weapon maintain likely present threat . 
army teach 
clean weapon daily , since usually need , regardless whether 
use ... would amaze sweaty holster get , much 
trail dust get . 
guess would scare former 
explorer post ... seem advisor national guard special force grunt , 
consider heresy wood without weapon ... course , 
usually would notice 'em ... tend avoid public scrutiny ... 
: course , may way solve solitude problem .
