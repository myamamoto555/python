pardon little confused , beginning second 
paragraph , say , `` god one set rule people , '' yet 
end paragraph declare , `` please combine ceremonial 
moral law one . '' 
understand bible 
find declaration 2 law ceremonial moral , 
also unclear whether think bad 2 set law first 
place . 
bad 2 set law , ceremonial law 
different moral law vice versa ? 
would also interested comment passage cor . 
10:1 -16 , 
paul teach different rule cover head pray 
depend whether man woman . 
think apostle 
prescribe different set rule man woman ? 
, 
jews gentiles ? 
also , paul , oppose circumcise 
gentile , voluntarily circumcise timothy ?
