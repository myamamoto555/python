must respectfully disagree assertion , brad . 
government 
notoriously sloppy physical , communication , information security . 

keep computer safe , `` try '' . 
read `` dea 
adequately protect national security information '' 
excellent example talk . 
private sector organization tend even lax security measure . 
believe escrow organization penetrate foreign 
intelligence service within month , week , selection . 
private 
organization lack resource intelligence service 
take longer - perhaps order one two year . 
nonetheless , 
penetration take place , without question .
