feedback base 
control operate point expect really hurt noise figure ! 

comment expert ? 
intend use atop stepper motor , provide heading 
beacon . 
plan 3 4 beacon , different frequency , 
room , tell 567 frequency . 
. 
one challenge available stepper 8 degree step ! 
know heading beacon , would use surveyor 
technique resection determine robot location . 
, go 
explain resection net . 
give hindsight , would digitize amplify output 
circuit , correlate in-phase & quadrature 
several expect frequency , extract amplitude beacon . 
numerous step , even 8 degree step , knowledge 
angular response , able 
rather accurately determine head beacon .
