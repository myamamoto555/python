oh well . 
attend colloquium goddard last fall head 
operation section nasa talk future mission 
go fund . 
remember name title hand 
discard colloquium announcement . 
case , 
ask matter : `` spend million 
keep instrument already place go ? '' 
many $ available 
lead time instrument like cobe , magellan , hubble , etc 
5-10 year minumum . 
spend could spend use 
current instrument current budget enviroment would 
little nothing future project . 
, sure 
short run science would wonderful would popular , 
however start year retire would become 
one greatest villan ever see space community 
fund early stage next generation instrument . 

benefit 's funding choice , owe 
whoever sucessor would eventually keep develop new 
mission , even expense cut instrument 
last drop possible science wring .
