good point , catch original post . 
thing 
come mind , since gravity feed fuel system , . 
fuel valve vacuum control # 1 . 
let 
suppose small hole bad seal either hose 
vacuum valve fuel . 
cold , hole open enough 
open valve enough allow gas carb choke , 
since choke create low pressure carb draw gas , 
engine surround area warm , hole seal . 
one way check fuel flow valve would pull side 
panel remove fuel hose carb . 
connect tube 
correct size , preferably clear tubing observe fuel flow , output 
side fuel . 
remove control hose # 1 . 
make 
sure tank full . 
place valve position apply vacuum 
control hose , preferably vacuum device gauge , check 
air leak . 
vacuum apply , fuel flow freely . 
see 
vent problem , fuel filler cap open close , 
flow lot faster filler cap open , may something 
vent airway change position depend position may clog 
partially clog vent . 
hear f2 fuel tank replace 
fix problem . 
thing might defective , control 
hose # 1 carb , valve , possibly fuel tank vent . 
show problem fuel flow cold , 
something carb screw , many thing check , 
would typing day list ! 
, everything back together , apply vacuum valve 
open drain hole carb one one check fuel flow . 
open 
airbox check foreign debris clogged airway carb , 
quite carb . 
hope something flush trouble shooting . 
american 
honda resolve , get mad hell report bbb 
call honda customer service hotline . 
800 number , recall 
top head . 
call tire f2 day 
later customer satisfaction inquiry card arrive home ask like 
support receive , would chance tell think ! 
buy service manual f2 , invaluable source information 
work bike might add , trouble shooting !
