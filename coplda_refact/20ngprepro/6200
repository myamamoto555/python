find 2.2 farad yes , farad ! 
cap work voltage

fool around analog job ? 
single chip 
micro crystal job reliably easily . 

cost $ 5 . 
$ 1 crystal business . 
embed 
whole thing foam insulate blanket , power solar cell , 
use excess power heat assembly day rely 
insulation hold heat darkness . 
want 
try thermal management , contact someone like icl cut 
special low temperature crystal . 
'll cost $ 20 . 
use single chip micro , look part count 
maybe 7 . 
processor , crystal , two cap crystal , power fet 
fire solenoid flyback diode battery . 
fewer part 
build analog timer infinitely reliable . 
add 
power zener diode heat solar cell part count 
scream 9 . 
pd assembler available common single chip micro . 

application trivial could even look op code 
programmer 's guide create binary hex editor .
