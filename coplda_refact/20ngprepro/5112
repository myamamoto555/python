identity 

_____ 
< 1.1 > ` identity ' internet ? 
generally , today people 's ` identity ' internet primarily 
determine email address sense 
unchanging ` face ' electronic realm . 

login name qualify complete address domain information , 
example `` . 
people see 
address receive mail reading usenet post 
situation program record usage . 
obsolete 
form address bitnet still persist . 
email message , additional information path message 
take message receive recipient . 

information identify chain host involve 
transmission accurate trace origination . 

type protocol also use usenet 
protocol lesser extent . 
forge field require 
corrupt mailing software site involve forwarding 
uncommon . 
uncommon forge chain 
origination point , initial site list fake 
time message create . 
trace message 
difficult impossible initial fake field name 
real machine represent real transfer route . 
_____ 
< 1.2 > identity un important internet ? 
concept identity closely intertwine communication , 
privacy , security , turn critical aspect 
computer network . 
example , convenience communication 
afford email would impossible without convention 
identification . 
many potential abuse identity 
possible severe consequence , massive 
computer network forefront issue , 
potentially either exacerbate solve problem . 
verify identity correct call ` authentication ' , 
one classic example problem associate 
's `` war world '' radio broadcast fool 
segment population think alien invasion 
progress . 
hoax order uncommon usenet 
forge identity make insidious . 
people 
reputation assault forgery . 
however , fluidity identity internet one 
attractive feature . 
identity useful 
harmful . 
professor might carefully explain topic 
find talk undergraduate . 
person particular 
occupation may able converse might normally 
shun . 
prejudice erase , , hand , many 
prejudice useful ! 
scientist might argue better 
evaluate finding paper reviewer know 
author . 
likewise , may likely reject 
base unfair irrelevant criterion . 
side 
connection , author may find identity reviewer useful 
exert pressure acceptance . 
identity especially crucial establish regulate 
` credit ' necessarily financial ` ownership ' ` usage ' . 
many function society demand reliable accurate technique 
identification . 
heavy reliance place digital 
authentication global economy become increasingly electronic . 
many government function service base identification , 
law enforcement frequently hinge . 
hence , employee 
many government organization push toward stronger identification 
structure . 
identification invade privacy ? 
growth internet provoke social force massive 
proportion . 
decision make issue identity affect 
many future user , especially network become increasingly 
global , universal , widespread , entrench ; positive 
adverse affect action , intend inadvertent , 
literally magnify exponentially . 
_____ 
< 1.3 > email address identify background ? 
email address may contain information influence people 's 
perception background . 
address may ` identify ' 
department particular university , employee 
company , government worker . 
may contain last name , 
initial , cryptic identification code independent . 

us base part social security number . 

form ` ' number increment 
order new user add system . 
standard internet address also contain information 
broad geographical location nationhood . 
however , none 
information guarantee correct . 

field domain qualification username base 
rather arbitrary organization , mostly invisible network 
cabling distribution . 
point make early field 
address specific specific computer name 
local network later one general 
continental domain . 
typically first field name 
computer receive mail . 
glean information email address alone sometimes 
inspired art inconsistent futile exercise . 

information , see faq email address know 
geographical distribution . 
however , unix utility exist

_____ 
< 1.4 > find somebody give email address ? 
one simple way send email address , ask . 
another 
way send mail postmaster address i.e. 
, although postmaster 's job help 
find user id 's particular people give real name solve 
mail route problem . 
i.e. ` may also 
able supply information . 
user related email address 
may information . 
however , method rely 
time patience use minimally . 
one basic tool determine identity 
internet unix utility ` finger ' . 
basic syntax : 
finger 
utility use communication protocol query computer 
name address information user name . 

response generate completely receive computer may 
format . 
possible response follow : 
- message ` unknown host ' mean aspect address 
incorrect , two line information ' ??? ' 
. 
- message ` real life : ??? ' 
case receive computer 
could find kind match username . 
finger 
utility may return response situation . 
- listing information associate multiple user . 

computer search match user id , 
attempt find username specify substring 
actual full name user keep local database . 
site ` finger ' use get list user 
system ` finger ' . 
general often 
consider weak security , however , ` attacker ' know valid 
user id 's ` crack ' password . 
information field return ` finger ' give . 
information ` finger ' locate people 's email address 
give email faq whoi lookup utility . 

use means find , use 
find . 
` finger ' find 
publicly report unix system . 

careful modify ` finger ' datum ; virtually anyone 
internet access worldwide query information . 
one 
amazing case , new york times writer j. markoff uncover 
identity r. morris , author internet worm , 
use anonymous tip ` finger ' . 
see book cyberspace 
k. hafner j. markoff . 
_____ 
< 1.5 > identification un stable internet ? 
generally , identity amorphous almost nonexistent concept 
internet variety reason . 
one inherent 
fluidity ` cyberspace ' people emerge submerge 
frequently , absence readily note ` community ' . 
people remember face voice , primary means casual 
identification ` real world ' . 
arbitary cryptic 
sequence letter digit comprise email address 
particularly noticeable memorable far unique 
identification individual , may use multiple account 
multiple machine anywhere world . 
currently internet user really great assurance 
message email usenet appear 
. 
person 's mailing address far identification 
individual . 
- anyone access account , e.g. know password , 
either legitimately otherwise , send mail address 
: line . 
- email address individual tend change frequently 
switch job make move inside organization . 
- part current mailing protocol standard , forge : 
line mail message fairly trivial operation many 
hacker . 
status path information message 
intermediate host generally . 
general , 
possible , forgery fairly rare newsgroup 
email . 
besides pathological case many basic 
problem today 's internet protocol affect identification 
internet : 
- internet mail standard , describe , still evolve 
rapidly entirely orderly . 
example , standard 
mail address ` mung ' ` parse ' tend vary slightly 
site frequently mean difference finding 
address bounce mail . 
- domain name computer name frequently change site , 
delay propagation datum . 
- address resolve certain critical computer 
crash , receive computer computer involve 
resolve name address call ` ' . 
- whole slew problem associate ` ' ; 
update find name address , even 
operation constitute ` update ' different 
interpretation different site . 
current internet mailing address protocol slightly 
anachronistic create network 
somewhat obscure widespread , fraction 
traffic see . 
today large proportion internet traffic 
email , comprise million message . 
_____ 
< 1.6 > future identification internet ? 
new technology standard introduce facial image 
voice message mail improve sense 
community come familiarity identification . 
however , currently widespread , require large amount 
datum transfer , standardized software , make compromise 
privacy . 
promising new cryptographic technique may make ` digital signature ' 
` digital authentication ' common see . 
also , trend 
usenet standard toward greater authentication post 
information . 
hand , advance ensure anonymity 
remailer forthcoming .

privacy 

_____ 
< 2.1 > ` privacy ' internet ? 
generally , ` privacy ' multiple connotation society 
perhaps even internet , cyberspace take 
mean exclusive use access account 
datum store direct email , 
encounter arbitrary restriction search . 
word , 
may obtain datum associate account , 
without permission . 
idea probably fairly 
limit liberal scope internet user 
consider private domain . 
user expect want 
privacy , expect demand . 
_____ 
< 2.2 > privacy un important internet ? 
somewhat debatable inflammatory topic , arouse 
passionate opinion . 
internet , take privacy 
grant rudely surprise find tenuous nonexistent . 
government rule protect privacy 
illegal search seizure clause u.s. constitution , adopt 
many antithetical law 
prohibit secret communication allow wiretapping . 

rule generally carry internet specific rule 
govern . 
however , legal repercussion global 
internet still largely unknown untested i.e. strong 
legal precedent court case . 
fact internet traffic 
frequently pass past international boundary , 
centrally manage , significantly complicate strongly 
discourage regulation . 
_____ 
< 2.3 > secure internet network ? 
- ` theoretically ' people site chain site 
access hardware network media transmit datum 
internet could potentially monitor archive . 
however , 
sheer volume general ` noise ' inherent datum make 
scenario highly improbable , even government agency 
supposedly vast funding resource . 
- technologies exist ` tap ' magnetic field give 
electrical wire without detection . 
less obscurely , machine 
network connection potential station traffic 
detection , scenario require knowledge access 
low-level hardware network card pursue , even 
possible . 
- company network general inc. one many manufacture 
market sophisticated network monitoring tool 
` filter ' read packet arbitrary criterion 
troubleshoot purpose , cost type device 
prohibitive casual use . 
know instance type security breach major 
scale network hub rare . 
greatest risk 
tend emerge locally . 
note approach almost 
completely defuse use cryptography . 
_____ 
< 2.4 > secure account ? 
default , . 
multitude factor may 
reinforce compromise aspect privacy internet . 
first , account must secure user . 
universal 
system use password , ` weak ' i.e. easy 
guess security significantly diminish . 
somewhat 
surprisingly frighteningly , certain user 
system , particularly administrator , generally unlimited 
access regardless password , may grant access 
. 
mean may read file account 
without detection . 
furthermore , universally know , unix system keep fairly 
extensive accounting record log , 
command execute , execute fact , login 
information usually public . 
feature ` auditing ' 
` process accounting ' information enable default 
initial installation system administrator may customize 
strengthen weaken satisfy performance privacy aim . 
information frequently consult troubleshoot 
purpose may otherwise ignore . 
datum track 
unsuccessful login attempt ` suspicious ' activity 
system . 
traditional part unix system track user 
command easily circumvent user use 
symbolic link describe ` man ln ' . 
unix implementation vary widely particularly tracking feature 
new sophisticated mechanism introduce company 
regularly . 
typically system adminstrator augment basic unix 
functionality public-domain program 
tool monitoring , use isolate ` suspicious ' 
activity arise e.g. remote access ` ' file , incorrect 
login attempt , remote connection attempt , etc. . 
generally , expect little privacy account 
various reason : 
- potentially , every keystroke type could intercept 
someone else . 
- system administrator make extensive backup completely 
invisible user may record state account 
many week . 
- erase file , many operate system , . 
- automate service keep log use troubleshooting 
otherwise ; example ftp site usually log command 
record domain origination user , include anonymous 
one . 
- software exacerbate problem . 
see section 
`` x windows security '' . 
indepedent malevolent administrator fellow user , much 
commonly harmful threat . 
multiple way help 
ensure account access , 
compromise often trace failure guideline : 
- choose secure password . 
change periodically . 
- make sure always . 
- leave machine unattended long . 
- make sure one watch type password . 
- avoid password reference email . 
- conservative use . 
file . 
- use utility like ` ' protect station , 
considerate . 
wary situation think supply 
password . 
several basic situation unix 
prompt password : log system 
change password . 
situation arise prompt 
password forge user , especially case 
talk internet relay chat . 
also , aware 
forge login screen one method illegitimately obtain 
password .

_____ 
< 2.5 > secure file directory ? 
important privacy consideration related file 
rights , many lapse trace misunderstand nature 
haphazard maintenance . 
aware rights associate 
file directory unix . 
` x ' ` execute ' right 
parent directory user , group , , 
user gain information anything directory . 
anything less may allow read , change , even delete 
file home directory . 
rights directory supersede 
rights associate file directory . 

directory , ` x ' mean access file subdirectory 
directory possible -- know name . 
list 
contents directory , however , require ` r ' right . 
default account owner , 
initial configuration vary site base administrator 
preference . 
default file mode specify initial rights 
associate newly create file , set shell 
` ' . 
detail rights implementation tend vary 
version unix . 
consult man page ` ' ` l ' . 
example 
-------- 
% ls - ld ~ 
------ 15 1536 jan 31 
listing rights associate user 's home 
directory , denote ` ~ ' . 
column left identify 
rights available . 
first column identify entry 
directory , next three column mean read , write , 
execute rights , respectively , permit user . 

directory , ` x ' right means contents file 
subdirectory name within directory list . 

subsequent column indicate user rights 
anything directory tree originate point . 

even ` see ' lower file subdirectory ; hierarchy 
completely invisible . 
% ls - l msg 
- -- r -- 1 jan 29 msg 
% u rw , g , o msg 
% ls - l msg 
- rw ------- 1 jan 29 msg 
mode file ` msg ' change take away rights 
` group ' ` ' . 
note ` ls - l ' require ` r ' right get list 
file subdirectory , ` x ' right access file 
subdirectory order get size , etc. . 
example , 
suppose directory ` foo ' rights dr -- r -- r -- , follow 
possible : 
l foo 
command would fail independent file rights : 
ls - l foo 
ls - l 
cat 
cd foo 
directory ` foo ' rights d -- x -- x -- x , follow 
possible know beforehand ` foo ' contain ` r ' 
readable file name ` file ' : 
ls - l 
cat 
cd foo 
follow command fail : 
l foo 
ls - l foo

_____ 
< 2.6 > secure x windows ? 
x windows primary software develop mit athena 
project fund u.s. government grant develop 
application harness power network enhance 
computational task , particularly human-computer interface . 
software implement client-server interface computer via 
graphical window . 
case ` client ' application 
request utilize graphical resource window 
mouse ` server ' machine provide . 
many 
situation client application program run 
machine server . 
great utility x windows come complete dissociation 
client server window may ` broadcast ' 
server remote location client . 
unfortunately 
dynamic power also introduce many deep , intricate , complicate 
security consideration . 
primary security privacy issue 
associate x windows much sensitive datum may 
send network , wider region , case 
human situate near host computer . 
currently 
encryption datum screen update keystroke x 
windows . 
due either intentional design decision unintentional design 
flaw , early version x window system extremely 
insecure . 
anyone account server machine disrupt 
display read electronically base access 
device unix regular user . 
protection 
type access version . 
problem arise 
security completely base machine address 
rather user , user ` trust ' machine 
trust . 
quote x documentation man : 
> client host host access control list allow 
> access x server . 
system work reasonably well 
> environment everyone trust everyone , 
> single person log give machine ... system 
> work well multiple people log single machine 
> mutual trust exist . 
access control list , ` ' command may prevent 
naive attempt i.e. unix 
evasion ; syntax type host machine ``

authorize client machine . 
default client run nonlocal 
host disabled . 
public domain program disrupt display

_____ 
< 2.7 > secure email ? 
default , . 
character read 
almost certainly encode ascii , american standard code 
information interchange map alphabetic symbolic 
character onto numeric code vice versa . 
virtually every 
computer system use code , , way convert 
. 
write mail message , default 
send ascii , since standard virtually 
universal , intrinsic privacy . 
despite millenium worth 
accumulate cryptographic knowledge , cryptographic technology 
recently establish afford high priority 
privacy primary criterion computer network design . 

potential pitfall privacy follow : 
- serious threat instance immature unscrupulous 
system operator read private mail ` spool file ' 
local site i.e. source destination message , 
university . 
- system administrator may also release file law enforcement 
agency , convention protocol warrant involve 
computer search still strongly establish 
test legally . 
- note bounce message go postmaster give site 
entirety . 
mean address mail 
incorrect address good chance see human 
recipient . 
- typically new user account always set local 
mail directory private , guarantee 
overridden . 
- finally , aware mailing list email address 
everyone list actually publicly via mail 
route software mechanism . 
` feature ' disabled . 
potential compromise email privacy thoroughly 
avoid use strong end-to-end cryptography , 
set caveat example , unscrupulous administrator 
may still threat encryption site share 
nonlocal . 
see section `` email privacy '' `` email 
policy . '' 
_____ 
< 2.8 > liable email posting ? 
punishment whatever , system administrator revoke 
certain ` privilege ' emailing , usenet post read 
certain group , file transfer , remote communication , 
generally subset capability available account . 
completely discretion local administrator 
procedure follow particular site , 
many case haphazard . 
currently 
virtually widespread , uniform guideline procedure 
restrict use internet service , local administrator 
free make arbitrary decision access . 
today punitive measure regularly apply various situation . 
typical scenario complaint reach system adminstrator 
regard abuse user , usually necessarily precede 
complaint user email , regard person 's 
objectionable email posting . 
` abusive ' poster usenet 
usually first give admonition system administrator 
urge ` net ' . 
debate persist endlessly 
many newsgroup whether also use questionable means 
attack silence ` harmless crackpot ' censor 
unpopular opinion . 
system administrator remote site regularly cooperate 
` squelch ' severe case abuse . 
general , however , tradition 
usenet reader remarkably tolerant diverse view use 
system , colorful slang help describe 
alternative patience sap : option 
wield individual user simply advance next 
message refer `` hit ` n ' key '' , ` plonk ' 
annoying poster accord hacker 's dictionary , sound 
jerk make end fall bottom kill file . 
case punitive action apply , generally system 
administrator least likely restrict email . 
usenet posting 
much commonly restricted , either individual user 
entire group university campus . 
restriction 
commonly associate follow ` abuse ' : 
- harassing threatening note , ` email terrorism ' 
- illegal use , e.g. piracy propagation copyright material 
- ` ad hominem ' attack , i.e. insulting reputation 
poster instead cite content message 
- intentional extreme vulgarity offensiveness 
- inappropriate posting , esp . 
binary file regular group 
` ' : inundate mail box numerous massive 
file 
major problem originate lack distinction private 
official email posting . 
user internet access via 
account business university activity 
internet construe representative parent 
organization . 
many people put disclaimer ` signature ' 
attempt dissociate identity activity parent 
organization precaution . 
recent visible political case 
involve privacy electronic mail write white house 
staff member bush administration . 
follow 
guideline : 
- acquaint company university policy . 
- possible , avoid use company email address private 
communication . 
- use disclaimer . 
- keep low profile avoid ` ' simply post . 
- avoid post information could construe 
proprietary ` internal ' .

_____ 
< 2.9 > provide information identity ? 
public information identity account mostly 
available though unix utility ` finger ' describe . 
- control information utility 
` ' , specifics vary site system use 
` - f ' . 
- provide unlimited information . 
plan file 
copy directly destination finger . 
- technique work site allow find 
` finger ` ing even vary . 
plan file send . 
- signature determine environment variable signature 
- usenet signature conventionally store . 
signature file 
home directory . 
provide less information online identity difficult 
involve . 
one approach ask system adminstrator 
change delete information full name . 
may able obtain access public account one 
someone unrelated personally . 
may able remotely 
login via modem otherwise computer 
physically near . 
tactic hide mask 
online activity nothing foolproof . 
consult man page

generally , file 
shared system good safeguard within user pool 
little protection possible corrupt system administrator . 
mask identity email usenet use different

______ 
< 2.10 > ? 
know ? 
requirement screen get system administration 
job thereby access information system vary widely 
site sometimes frighteningly lax , especially 
university . 
many unix system university largely 
manage undergraduate background computing often 
` hacking ' . 
general , commercial industrial site

______ 
< 2.11 > privacy un stable internet ? 
numerous reason list , privacy 
expectation current use internet . 
furthermore , large 
part internet fund u.s. nsf national science 
foundation place certain restriction use 
prohibit commercial use . 
high-level official 
government agency may oppose emerge technique 
guarantee privacy encryption anonymous service . 
historically major threat privacy internet 
local . 
perhaps common example widespread 
occurrence university administrator refuse carry 
portion usenet newsgroup label ` pornographic ' . 

` alternative ' hierarchy usenet system , virtually 
restriction propagation new group creation , 
frequently target although material may appear anywhere . 
global point view traffic generally completely 
unimpeded internet egregious offender 
pursue . 
example , verbatim transcription copyright 
material newspaper magazine article post 
usenet regularity without major consequence email 
complaint may ensue . 
astonishing currently 
significant portion usenet traffic , less internet 
traffic , comprise digitized image almost 
entirely originate copyright material newsgroup 
` ' regularly highest traffic . 
______ 
< 2.12 > future privacy internet ? 
argue internet currently adequate 
appropriate level privacy . 
argue 
prototype future global network woefully inadequate 
safeguard . 
internet grow become completely global , 
international superhighway datum , traffic 
inevitably entail datum voice message , postal mail , 
many item extremely personal nature . 
computer item 
many people consider completely private local hard 
drive literally inch global network connection . 
also , sensitive industrial business information exchange 
network currently volume may conceivably merge 
internet . 
would agree , basic sensitive use 
internet , significant mechanism currently place 
ensure much privacy . 
new standard call uniform 
introduction ` privacy enhance mail ' pem use encryption 
technology ensure privacy , privacy protection 
automatic , may significantly improve safeguard . 
technology extremely destructive privacy 
surreptitious overwhelmingly 
effective protect e.g. encryption . 
government 
agency oppose unlimited privacy general , believe 
lawfully forfeit case criminal conduct 
e.g. wiretapping . 
however , powerful new 
technology protect privacy computer become 
increasingly popular , provoke say `` cat

anonymity 

_____ 
< 3.1 > ` anonymity ' internet ? 
simply state , anonymity absence identity , 
ultimate privacy . 
however , several variation 
simple theme . 
person may wish consistently 
identify certain pseudonym ` handle ' establish 
reputation area , provide . 
person may wish completely untraceable single 
one-way message sort ` hit-and-run ' . 
, person may 
wish openly anonymous carry conversation 
either know anonymous identity via 
` anonymous return address ' . 
user may wish appear 
` regular user ' actually untraceable . 
sometimes user 
wish hide send mail addition

user may wish access 
service hide sign association .

tricky carry practice , tracking 
mechanism inherent operate system network protocol . 
official nsf government agency may oppose

nevertheless , inherent facelessness large network 
always guarantee certain element anonymity . 
_____ 
< 3.2 > ` anonymity ' un important internet ? 
anonymity another powerful tool beneficial 
problematic depend use . 
arguably absence 
identification important presence . 
may 
case many strong benefit electronic anonymity 
discover unforeseen unpredicted , true 
anonymity historically difficult establish . 
one use anonymity make personal statement colleague 
would sabotage relationship state openly 
scenario . 
one use pass information 
evade threat direct retribution . 
example , 
` whistleblower ' reporting government abuse economic , social , 
political bring issue light without fear stigma 
retaliation . 
sensitive , personal , potentially damaging information 
often post usenet group , risky situation 
anonymity allow conversation carry completely 
independent identity participant . 
police 
department run phone service allow anonymous reporting 
crime ; use would straightforward network . 
unfortunately , extortion harassment become insidious 
assurance anonymity .

guideline . 
requirement obtain 
account different site institution make anonymous 
account generally difficult obtain public large . 
many communication protocol inherently detrimental 
anonymity . 
virtually every protocol existence currently 
contain information sender receiver every packet . 
new communication protocol likely develop guarantee 
much higher degree secure anonymous communication . 
_____ 
< 3.4 > ` anonymous mail ' ? 
one approach ` ' mail set ` anonymous 
server ' , activate email address , respond 
allocate supply ` anonymous id ' unique 
person request base email address .

forwards message , appear originate 
anonymous server corresponding anonymous user id . 
` interactive ' use anonymity

machine mail send certain 
characteristic distinguish regular incoming mail 
typically field header . 
one implement

several existence

may operation outside system administrator knowledge . 
remailer generally support anonymous return address . 
mail incorrectly address receive operator . 
generally user remailer disavow 
responsibility message forward system , 
although actually may hold liable regardless . 
approach several serious disadvantage weakness : 
- anonymous server approach require maintain mapping 
anonymous id 's real address must maintain 
indefinitely . 
one alternative allow ` ' 
alias request user , 
implement yet . 
- although unlikely scenario , traffic site could 
conceivably monitor ` outside ' , necessitate 
use cryptography basic protection , . 
- local administrator shut either caprice 
pressure local , network , government agency . 
- unscrupulous provider service monitor traffic 
go . 
- remailer currently keep log may inspect . 
- cypherpunk approach tend highly unstable

< 3.6 > anonymity un stable internet ? 
note , many factor compromise anonymity currently available 
general internet community , service 
use great caution . 
summarize , technology 
infancy current approach unrefined , unreliable , 
completely trustworthy . 
standard establish 
troubling situation loss anonymity bug software 
prevalent . 
encounter potential bug : 
- one anonymous remailer reallocate already allocate anonymous 
return address . 
- pass signature information embed message 
unaltered . 
- address resolution problem result anonymized mail bounce 
remailer common . 
- forgery anonymous server problem , possibly 
allow unauthorized user potentially glean anon id - email 
address mapping alias file . 
remedy 
use password . 
- infinite mail loop possible chain remailer . 
source code distribute , test , refine 
system , standard progress slowly weakly . 

field likely improve considerably without official 
endorsement action network agency . 
whole idea 
essentially still infancy view suspicion 
distrust many internet , see illegitimate favorable 
criminality . 
major objection anonymity regular 
internet use perceive lack accountability system 
operator , i.e. invulnerability account restriction result 
outside complaint . 
system adminstrator site 
threaten filter anonymous news posting generate 
prominent server redistribution flow . 
may 
effect encouraging server operator create less 
characteristically detectable header . 
probably least 
problematic approach , traditional usenet , 
individual user deal anonymous mail however prefer , 
e.g. ignore filter kill file . 
_____ 
< 3.7 > future anonymity internet ? 
new anonymous protocol effectively serve significantly increase 
safeguard anonymity . 
example , mechanism 
route email multiple host , thereby threaten privacy , 
also use guarantee . 
scheme call ` chain ' 
anonymous message pass multiple anonymous server 
reach destination . 
way generally multiple 
link chain ` break ' security 
compromise . 
link make scenario even 
unlikely . 
even significantly anonymous remailer 
could spread internet globally local weakness 
corrupt government legal wiretapping within nation 
would unlikely sacrifice overall security message 
trace . 
however , remailer run corrupt operator possible . 
future anonymous service internet , time , 
highly uncertain fraught peril . 
specific group seem 
benefit significantly anonymous post capability , many 
feel unlimited newsgroup scope anonymous post 
disruptive dangerous idea detract discussion 
` serious ' group . 
introduction unlimited group anonymity 
may fundamental repercussion usenet convention 
distribution mechanism moderate ` alt ' group 
past . 
example , part new group creation , 
charter may specify whether ` anonymous ' post un welcome . 
nevertheless , widespread introduction use anonymity may 
inevitable . 
base traffic statistics , anonymous service 
huge demand . 
pervasive readily available anonymity could 
carry significant unforeseen social consequence . 
however , 
use continue generally regard subversive may 
confine underground . 
ramification widespread 
introduction anonymity usenet still largely unknown . 

unclear whether provoke signficant amount new 
traffic , instead expansion , cause shift greater 
portion exist traffic . 
conceivably 
service could play role influence future mainstream social 
acceptance usenet .
