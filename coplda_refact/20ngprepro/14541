one interesting thing notice use 
chip key encode session key law enforcement field . 
use encryption algorithm . 
seem like would possible create device would 
otherwise compatible , would send bogus law enforcement field . 
might render device unusable `` normal '' device 
sort validation involve law enforcement field , 
could certainly use modify device . 
course , irrelevant nsa backdoor 
algorithm , make possible defeat key escrow system .
