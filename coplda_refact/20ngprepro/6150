history handy , recall preponderance 
roy 's come win team . 
fact , think team performance 
generally irrelevant , almost always deserving candidate win . 
wrong ? 
necessarily lose team . 
angels ' staff 
still weak , everyday lineup quite well , thank 
. 
snow play great . 
salmon learn make adjustment . 
easley appear fine , even flora ready come . 
gonzales gruber 'll manage hot corner . 
polonia 
curtis steady heady . 
even myers orton contribute . 
personally , think finish .500 make 
win team .
