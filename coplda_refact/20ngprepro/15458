return investment vary accord market ,

islamic bank relatively new phenomenon islamic world . 
islamic bank `` west '' , include usa ,

`` islamic bank '' relatively early stage 
development case . 
bcci certainly `` islamic 
bank '' -- bcci ever pay fixed interest rate deposit ?

whether muslims partially bank whatever completely 
irrelevant .
