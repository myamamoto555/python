trick install atm window ... install first 
, run atm control panel get window . 
best reason atm adobe standard . 
truetype 
fail m venture undercut adobe adobe nasty 
keep format proprietary . 
service bureau print 
shop smirk send way bring truetype document 
high resolution printing rip . 
although lot pretty tt font float around , really 
dot matrix lazer printer . 
however , convert tt font similar program 
atm font high end stuff . 
use dot matrix printing , may waste 
money !
