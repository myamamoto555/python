, fancy compression need ? 
: far know isdn call , plug 
: 8 bit give one channel guess go 
: sampling rate 6000 hz want quality 
: . 
anybody know & - factor voice ? 
post info celp code . 
look like 
squeeze speech fast enough computer like 
sparcstation newton acorn risc machine 
drop bandwidth low figure feasible run 
speech run top slip modem . 

let run point point encrypted speech , 'll let 
run speech internationally internet no-one stop 
get heavy regulation . 
thought , 
administration realize , would probably scare . 
course trick develop define standard protocol 
internet speech damn fast , allow anyone feel brave 
custom handheld hardware well hacking 
workstation . 
difficult . 
celp stuff standardise , 
use stream , protocol allow silence use 
catch net lag , also avoid send datum 
silence ie wise synchronise real-time end 
net delay would add big 
, go press ahead try stuff soon 
get sparc back loan buy necessary microphone . 
'll save fortune call friend every night : 
whether encrypted 
know , surely someone work . 
? 
obvious , 
exist already ? 
see suns 
celp compression restricted ether connection .
