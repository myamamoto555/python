note `` scientific evidence '' area prove conclusion . 
evidence suggest certain part homosexual 's 
brain different heterosexual - prove little . 
also notice apostle `` scientific 
evidence '' link certain gene alcoholism , steal certain 
genetic problem . 
even scientific evidence , doubt 
would stop communicate teaching holy 
spirit thing sinful . 
remind conversation professor mine . 
say 
something true . 
christianity teach give 
every inclination . 
people give leaning . 
christianity , concept struggle flesh , 
bring submission . 
one person may problem 
temper , murderous heart , another may problem 
homosexuality , another may incline greed . 
god offer 
opportunity conquerer .
