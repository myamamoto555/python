maybe 300 pair suffice reconstruct s1 s2 ? 
back - 
door encryption algorithm perhaps would possible 
manufacturer get key chip program 
one session . 
would , btw , enable anybody else retrieve 
key way 'll never get bunch 300 n , u 
pair identical s1 s2 . 
note constant 
whole batch nature procedure , i.e. , 
type manually ` random number supply agent ' ! 
wonder 'll always 300 chip one session ... 
since procedure describe ms denning impose high cost 
production every chip least three person one hour , 
plus cost laptop finally blow piece spectacular , 
bonfire ; add travel expense , drink lighting , 
divide sum 300 larger demand -- 
private sector anyway . 
let mention one think certainly occur 
notoriously paranoid people group : go 
verify _ _ interested party perform tempest attack 
vault ?? 
much smoke mirror -- nice , honest 
fire something really worth hide ...
