sure problem cause software ? 
see sort 
effect runaway program could cause init 
conflict , instance accidentally wack register video 
hardware . 
try boot extension let 
sit finder ? 
might also want try change 
24-bit address yes , know access full 64 mb ram - 
experiment video hardware register access 
. 
another thing try ` recovery ' measure use something like 
change pixel depth display . 
reprogram 
video hardware register may allow sync restore .
