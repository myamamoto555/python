luke 16 talk rich man lazarus . 
matthew 25 talk 
eternal fire prepare devil angel . 
revelation 
20 21 reference fire place unbeliever 
throw . 
matthew 18 talk throw eternal fire 
fire hell . 
seem quite clear place 
fire burn forever . 
revelations passage clear 
devil angel torment forever . 

matthew 25 passage seem abundantly clear whether 
punishment unbeliever everlasting sense final 
sense continual . 
dale 's question , come away suggestion hell , 
short , might acceptable alternative live 
forever source life , peace joy i.e. 
unbeliever cease exist . 
whereas , punishment go 
continually , one greater motivation avoid . 
definately seem hell something want avoid 
regardless exact nature . 
seem two main question dale 's thought : 
god 's main plan earth ? 
continual punishment necessary part hell oppose 
simply destroy completely refuse god ? 
believe god 's main plan genuine relationship 
people . 
nature hell reason nature seem lot 
difficult ascertain . 
seem clear hell something 
avoid . 
minimum , hell state one one 
nothing god . 
bible , aware discussion specifics 
hell beyond general hot , unpleasant torment . 
instance , 
discuss rich man 
continually stay fire still feel discomfort pain 
whether point pain sense ability 
burn . 
forgive , throw 
physical body fire , assume person start alive , 
fairly quick point , nerve destroy pain 
longer sense . 
state occur judgement , 
unbeliever , already physically dead cast hell 
i.e. longer physical body feel physical 
pain . 
could sense continually hell 
forever without god . 
man parable tell idea listener 
think physical term order get point people 
listen god even rise dead . 
point 
parable reach hard-hearted listen 
fact resurrection gospel jesus christ . 
seem reasonable also draw parable hell 
even remotely pleasant .
