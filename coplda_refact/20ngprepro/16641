much energy burster put ? 
know energy depend 
distance , unknown . 
answer form _ x _ erg per 
^ 2 ok .

supernovae put 10 ^ 53 10 ^ 54 forget , 
order magnitude ... . 
gamma ray , though . 
would hafta get 
gamma 9 mpc , decent fraction 
sn output gamma could reasonably extragalactic 
closer 9 mpc . 
dunno sn theory well , think 
get many gamma . 
maybe look . 
big radio galaxy put 10 ^ 46 continually . 

radio ... lot gamma around , , `` burst '' ? 
nah . 
neither take explanation ... try show 
energy produce thing know .
