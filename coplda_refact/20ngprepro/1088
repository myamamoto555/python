nooo !!! 
ground green wire safety . 
current suppose flow 
normal condition . 
mean normally voltage drop 
either . 
suppose safe touch ground wire ... even 
ground way time . 
neutral white wire , dave correctly say , return 
hot wire . 
since current flow , voltage drop . 

plug heavy load ground outlet , commonly 
measure volt difference neutral ground . 
suppose connect together breaker panel ... nowhere , 
repeat nowhere , else . 
well , almost . 
strange exception thing 
like . 
want outlet without additional wiring 
use outlet breaker , outlet cheaper . 
fact , 
depend put new outlet , may require . 
faq electrical wiring , post regularly 
. 
go great detail issue include gfci 
probably read ask question . 
'll mail copy 
, append copy , ask writer 
future .
