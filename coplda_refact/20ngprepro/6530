minor quibble : assualt one begin near dawn . 
fire 
break several hour . 
find highly unlikely bd would 
cooking lunch armored vehicle punch hole house 
pump tear gas . 
lantern story make sense , except fire 
seem spread quickly , even give nature building 
high wind . 
daylight , guess recess 
could dark -- shutter probably close well . 
put back fbi , bd , screw - 
occur , quite possible . 
problem fbi monolithic entity require 
everybody involve keep mouth shut . 
tend behave 
like total idiot , make maniac , either . 

one nutcase agent , serve purpose blame whole agency . 
believe real like koresh would start fire , 
far convinced actually . 
, rarely go make blanket condemnation 
within 2 hour confusing incident 175 mile away ... 
semper fi ,
