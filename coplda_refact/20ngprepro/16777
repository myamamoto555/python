may naive question basis 
claim cpu get hotter computationally intensive

friend claim little difference 
temperature idle cpu cpu run computationally 
intensive job .

asic digital design , cpu design . 
would seem 486 , fpu use , 
cache access , chip idle , 
multiplier multiply , barrel shifter shift , 
microcode microcode , etc. . 
mean transistor 
switching mean less power dissipate cmo , mean 
less heat . 
\ 
understand , pentium shut section 
cpu use order cut .
