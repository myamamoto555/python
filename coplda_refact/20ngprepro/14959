know trendy nowadays dump morris , let 's give credit 
credit due . 
doubtful blue jay would win al east without morris . 
last year , team go 13-15 month august , 
starter shell , milwaukee make charge , 
morris go 5-1 pretty good era remember exactly . 
also , let 's underestimate importance 240 + inning save 
bullpen every fifth day . 
help win al east , forget 
world series . 
run support high 5.98 run 's 5.90 run 
win 12 game . 
remember morris win inordinate number 
6-5 8-6 ballgame , credit . 
pitch good 
need . 
6-1 ballgame , put cruise 
control throw ball let batter `` get '' 
hate expression ! 
. 
inexperienced pitcher would wear 
try make perfect pitch keep era . 
morris , 
veteran pitcher , know win thing really matter 
baseball . 
save , able reach back little extra 
hate ! 
game line . 
yes morris crap big time year , let 's change history 
suit present . 
btw , think put bullpen ; would embarrass 
veteran pitcher cito would never , era 17 + , much 
embarrass ?
