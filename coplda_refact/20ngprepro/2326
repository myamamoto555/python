move problem back one level : tell 
conscience properly form ? 
way tell presuppose capable judge 
conscience . 
word , sure 
conscience ` properly form ' assume evaluation 
trust . 
assume conclusion save lot time , ` ll 
grant , valid way reasoning . 
unless infallible , judgement thinking 
certain . 
therefore , possible certain conscience 
` properly form ' . 
whatever suppose mean . 
mr boundary give another paradigm example problem :

church ` necessity ' infallible interpreter divine revelation ? 
know ? 
presumably , believe argument 
another -- know argument contain mistake ?

huge difference ` confidence ability 
distinguish true true ' ` infallible ' . 

confident lot thing , absolute certainty long way 
` confident ' . 
discussion arrogance claim absolutely certain 
really , go check subject line . 
say absolutely certain 
significantly different say confident . 
say 
confident , invite people ask . 
except limited circumstance , say absolutely 
certain , invite people dismiss someone 
idea fallibility . 
yet meet anyone believe source 
truth would admit possibility error reasoning . 

-- every last one -- claim infallible . 
result convince idea go . 
darren f provine 
particular discussion may entirely relevant 
original criticism . 
get feeling original poster 
regard arrogant idea right wrong 
answer religion , difference eternal 
consequence . 
say think hell 
least significant danger end , admit 
-- say -- reasoning process use reach 
fallible . 
thus least principle could wrong . 

basic fact clearly enough teach bible think 
unlikely misinterpret . 
order get level 
confidence , try frame statement sufficiently carefully 
sidestep number controversial issue . 
, 
example say non-christian definitely end hell , 
attempt describe hell detail . 

feel view go regard arrogant 
intolerant even though acknowledge fallible 
chance wrong . 
get wrong -- think lot genuinely arrogant 
christian , often criticism justified . 
least 
case think criticism constitute blame messenger . 
universe set eternal consequence 
certain decision , fault -- tell way 
think . 
may think god immoral set thing 
way . 
one critique christianity find 
difficult respond . 
arrogance tell 
think truth .
