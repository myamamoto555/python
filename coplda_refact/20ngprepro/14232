maybe freeman prove point point relevant . 
thing 
people seem care ask question carry 
conceal weapon whether carry conceal 
person street somewhere . 
sure many 
people concern whether carry conceal home . 
speak someone live illinois place 
quote law relevant know legal handgun 
take account city ordinance . 
could care less whether 
carry conceal home . 
care fact 
carry conceal place really count - street . 
freeman love accurate understand especially 
seem forget accurate fact always replace common sense . 
go followup thread anymore believe 
useless argue point anymore . 
thing happen 
freeman `` run around circle '' try prove 
wrong time play game anymore . 
course 
freeman attack use common sense earlier 
post . 
advice freeman - quit picky 
accuracy sometimes use common sense ; really work - 
time .
