firearm tend fall low area . 
would 
economic smuggle . 
production would 
local . 
many people skill 
motivation assemble worthwhile firearm scratch . 
high-ranking crime figure could obtain import uzis , 
average person , average thug , would lucky get 
- would pay nose . 
good point make . 
however , zip gun , definition , crude , 
homemade gun -- certainly something capable sustained , accurate 
fire , would useful means get normal gun . 
recall 
tiny , single-shot pistol make ally world war ii 
use partisan . 
essentially well-made , incapable 
effective fire beyond foot . 
useful means 
kill german soldier gun . 
also note ' favorite , sten gun , 
specifically design require little machine work possible . 
point 's make one could make sten clone steel 
tubing , hand tool welder . 
still think point good , think difference 
marijuana firearm , quality marijuana grow 
locally ; need import stuff . 
gun ban , 
think demand `` real '' gun sufficient make smuggling 
economically feasible , thus render ban moot . 
case , 
result would -- people criminal 
firearm , `` bad guy '' continue access , one way 
another . 
see necessary situation .
