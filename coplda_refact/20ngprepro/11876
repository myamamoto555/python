let return question , stipulate paul mean use 
_ _ refer less exactly levitical prohibition 
male-male sex . 
order bring problem clearly , ` ll 
also stipulate think far less plausible paul coin 
term usage . 
question want turn would 
mean paul 's reader later christian . 
shorter 
last note , see question rapidly confront 
major division within christ 's body , try 
open gate flame across terrible chasm 
separate fellow christian . 
bias loosely 
`` liberal '' evident , grind 
axe , much try get party see may hard 
reach `` closure '' issue involve strike heart 
, different way , see crucial gospel christ . 
; stipulate paul 's intent , immediate question : 
reader understand intent ? 
follow question , 
second one : proper action manage understand ? 
since paul give single clue meaning text 1st 
corinthians , two `` positive '' answer one `` negative '' 
question : 
+ a. paul apollos , someone apostolic community 
convey corinthians jewish - 
nation homosexual behavior , paul expect 
sufficiently tradition need 
futher explanation . 
note evidence 
letter , 2 corinthian supposition 
+ b. spirit teach paul mean , paul , 
god mean `` behind '' paul 's inspired . 
- c. know , guess within better pre - 
, comparison , parallel use paul , 
passage word _ _ `` 
'' -- think _ _ `` obvious '' 
root , try cut tooth word ! 
neb 
translate `` grabber '' even _ _ `` drunkard '' 
-- least advantage common insult , 
least hint meaning ! 
three position less -- allow exaggeration 
sake argument -- define classical catholic attitude towards 
tradition , one form protestant _ solum scriptura _ , 
demand evidence . 
three position strength weakness . 
_ ad _ : unquestionable gospel preach 
community christ 's disciple successor , 
nt scripture emerge communal tradition . 
also case know little nothing 
tradition almost century paul , say 
access tradition several generation 
possibly confuse transmission . 
scripture 
documentation tradition critical era . 
_ ad _ b : bear water spirit revert john 
attempt explain paul , hope - 
stand gospel nicodemus ; neither tradition 
man vain elevation reason prevent spirit 
blow -- paraclete kamikaze . 

downside protestant belief efficacy spirit 
guide scripture wing protestantism 
take seriously also fragmented divergent 
understand supposedly derive `` clear '' word god . 
note : classical lutheran , calvinist anglican thought 
constrain scripture read within tradition , even 
reserve judgment tradition scripture ; 
bizarre form `` read scripture way '' 
primarily fringe aspect `` cultic '' protestantism . 
main problem approach apparently 
means one person convey another one may feel 
teach receive spirit ; history show incredible 
conflict christian point , mind 
`` convinced '' lead spirit . 
one seriously 
urge point b without sense potential set christian 
christian . 
purpose ? 
_ ad _ c : critical approach distinct advantage 
reach conclusion , lay datum way open 
. 
weakness obvious corollary : usually 
possible . 
: - 
may say word , already acknowledge bias ; 
one complaint critical methodology `` dissolve '' 
faith -- surely `` faith '' honestly face - 
ation evidence problem mere theology helpless 
address . 
anyway , serious unfortunate possibility schism 
`` liberal '' `` conservative '' position , mostly basis extreme 
zealot position b c. catholic sense authority tradition 
tend constrain argument b contra c secondary position , 
despite horrendous strain rome likely find issue 
ultimately divisive protestant world . 
anglicans 
predict muddle _ via media _ , attempt give position 
due , due . 
second question . 
suppose tradition tell , lot `` spiritual '' 
christian tell , critical thought least admit possible , 
paul refer flat , universal levitical prohibition 
male-male sex . 
? 
, abdicate personal - 
bility tradition , let dictate answer . 
precisely 
inherit tradition question dangerous . 
example christ question pharisees use 
tradition despite urge , matthew heed . 
example peter , radically still paul , jettison 
tradition lead spirit call question . 
jesus 
peter paul much `` throw '' tradition subject 
radical criticism , couple basic grounds : 
`` weightier demand law : justice mercy good faith '' 
matthew 
`` two commandment love god & neighbor hand whole law , 
prophets , also . '' 
matthew 22:40 
fundamental derive christ validity 
challenge tradition , validity lead first generation 
go far waive application torah gentile convert 
vastly beyond anything directly jesus ' report 
word deed , signify certain failure imagination 
postulate tradition specific challenge 
fact open challenge . 
tradition pass man tradition man . 
god may 
lead even , tradition source spiritual 
instruction freely grant . 
tradition inherently human , 
inherently corruptible give fall , corrupt . 
nothing 
immune challenge , spirit show failure justice , mercy 
good faith . 
nothing may ultimately stand unless follow 
love god love neighbor . 
perfectly willing grant could blind sin . 

spirit may teach another refuse teach 
dense learn . 
tradition might value . 

know tradition one occasion , superstitious christian 
appeal justinian earthquake asia minor , scapegoat 
`` sodomite '' `` cause '' earthquake , legislation 
pass make homosexual behavior capital offense . 

accord gospel christ , christian . 
human 
tradition hateful vicious . 
see nothing much 
different unbidden eruption onto usenet people quick 
condemn slow understand . 
lead spirit , 
want part . 
find obedience lord 
, , totally dependent witness christian , 
truth live body christ . 
say doubt gay christianity god gamaliel 
say doubt pharisee would suppress earliest church : 
`` careful deal people ... enterprise , 
movement , human origin break 
accord ; fact come god 
unable destroy , might find 
fight god . '' 
act 5:36 ... 39 
ask listen tradition , read scripture 
mind soul open spirit , past history 
first christian witness ' willingness challenge tradition 
reading scripture -- though read authority scribe 
rabbi -- submission declaration must depend 
love god neighbor . 
, study evidence ; learn history 
christian oppress christian tradition eagerness 
judge jesus paul tell judge . 
let witness 
spirit life fellow christian -- include 
preference theology -- guide towards god 's truth . 
-- 
michael l. siemon say `` god , son 
high , ; nevertheless 
- - shall die like man , fall 
. 
. 
com like prince . '' 
psalm -7 
certain ambiguity discussion position , 
whether speak tradition paul 's time . 
think 
two way use tradition . 
one say paul 
reader share tradition , make sense interpret word 
context share tradition . 
make think 
argument word turn silly . 
know 
paul come background rather puritanical sex . 
everything else say sex consistent background . 
tone remark homosexuality rom 1 consistent 
background . 
even word sin list 
general term homosexual activity seem 
evidence , one piece 
evidence something would probably willing believe 
evidence -- paul share common jewish rejection 
homosexuality . 
identify catholic position , rather 
horse different color . 
catholic position involve 
continue church tradition . 
argument specific tradition 
might 1 get guidance interpret paul 's original 
mean tradition , e.g. way church father interpret 
, 2 gain confidence prohibition still apply 
time universal judgement church 
time . 
think somewhat different use tradition . 
radical protestant might willing use known 1st cent . 
tradition illuminate paul 's original meaning , use 
catholic position answer question attitude 
homosexuality .
