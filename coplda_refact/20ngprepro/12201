agree joseph 's accurate statement catholic dogma 
mary 's perpetual , interpret luke 1:28 , 
angel come , say , `` hail , full 
grace , lord thee . 
blessed art thou among woman . '' 
luke 1:48 ? 
... , behold , henceforth generation shall call bless . 
suppose verse might interpret mean mary 
possess limited quantity quality grace , 
, seem `` full grace '' mean say : 
fill brim , incapable contain . 
people 
know abundance grace soul exist heaven 
another catholic dogma , base communion saint , explain 
earlier post . 
full grace mean sinless , anyone 
ever sin life without sin sense mary 
sinless . 
catholic , find certain dogma tough embrace . 

catholic faith prayer come play . 
pray god 
strengthen accept faith give bride christ , 
turn usually strengthen community faith church . 
, 
probably know , faith christ 's church tantamount faith 
christ inasmuch church christ 's mystical body . 
catholic 
nature must two aspect faith christ : 1 personal faith 
christ personal redeemer 2 community faith church 
body christ .
