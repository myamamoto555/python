shuttle roll liftoff ? 
follow answer translation provide ken jenks 
. 
`` ascent guidance flight control training manual , '' asc 2102 , 
say : 
`` vertical rise phase , launch pad attitude 
command v rel sufficient assure launch tower 
clearance achieve . 
, tilt maneuver roll program 
orient vehicle head attitude require generate 
negative , turn alleviate structural loading . 

advantage attitude performance gain , decrease abort 
maneuver complexity , improve s-band look angle , crew view 
horizon . 
tilt maneuver also require start gain 
downrange velocity achieve main engine cutoff meco target 
second stage . '' 
really good answer , couch nasa jargon . 
'll try 
interpret . 
1 wait shuttle clear tower roll . 
2 , roll shuttle around angle attack 
wind cause passage atmosphere 
`` relative wind '' chord wing imaginary line 
leading edge trail edge slightly 
negative angle `` negative '' . 
cause little bit 
`` downward '' force toward belly orbiter , + z 
direction force `` alleviate structural loading . '' 
careful wing -- 
`` delicate '' part vehicle . 
3 new attitude roll also allow carry 
mass orbit , achieve higher orbit mass , 
change orbit higher lower inclination would 
case roll `` performance gain '' . 
4 new attitude allow crew fly less complicated 
flight path execute one dangerous abort 
maneuver , return launch site `` decrease abort maneuver 
complexity '' . 
5 new attitude improve ability ground-based radio 
antenna good line-of-sight signal s-band radio 
antenna orbiter `` improve s-band look angle '' . 
6 new attitude allow crew see horizon , 
helpful mandatory part pilot fly machine . 
7 new attitude orient shuttle body 
nearly parallel ground , nose east 
usually . 
allow thrust engine add velocity 
correct direction eventually achieve orbit . 
remember : 
velocity vector quantity make speed direction . 
shuttle large horizontal component 
velocity small vertical component attain orbit . 
beg question , `` launch pad orient give 
nice attitude begin ? 
shuttle need roll 
achieve attitude ? '' 
answer pad leftovers 
apollo day . 
shuttle straddle two flame trench -- one 
solid rocket motor exhaust , one space shuttle main 
engine exhaust . 
see effect daytime 
launch . 
srm exhaust dirty gray garbage , ssme exhaust 
fluffy white steam . 
watch difference `` top '' 
orbiter side `` bottom '' external tank side stack . 

access tower support service structure orient 
basically way saturn v 's . 
side note : 
saturn v 's also roll program . 
ask -- shuttle 
guy . 
check buddy ascent dynamics . 
add `` roll 
maneuver '' really maneuver three axis : roll , pitch yaw . 
roll component maneuver perform reason 
state . 
pitch component control load wing keep 
angle attack within tight tolerance . 
yaw 
component use determine orbital inclination . 
total 
maneuver really express `` quaternion , '' 
concept combine three rotation matrix one 
array .
