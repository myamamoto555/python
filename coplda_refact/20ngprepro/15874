copy protection serve one pur - 
pose : keep honest buyer make legal backup copy . 

definitely stop pirate . 
want protect soft , supply 
good documentation support . 
way effectively pro 
software . 
best regard , 
arno 
strongly disagree . 
think pirate amateur , 
copy program `` '' . 
talk 20 % max goal pirate copy , bet anything 
beat , easily copy hard drive , 
suffice . 
hate hard copy manual , would rather doc online - 
want copy program , usually faster 
convenient sift old book find . 
deeper end - > everyone think need able make 
backup copy ? 
almost new software must install hard disk , 
leave original backup . 
think waste 
time , space , money , well make tempting `` lend '' 
backup . 
flame intend - thought .
