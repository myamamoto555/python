lose side `` discover '' `` new '' evidence .

many expert fact witness want trial 
start . 
let re-open case practically 
invitation every civil litigant earth keep ace hole 
case verdict go . 
btw , federal criminal case , rule 33 permit motion new 
trial `` base ... newly discover evidence '' make within 2 
year verdict . 
emphasis mine . 
try make 
backhanded point criminal justice discussion
