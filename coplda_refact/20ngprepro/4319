joe fisher 
follow mostly play `` devil 's advocate '' . 

advocate either position . 
concern people understand 
possible see passage different way . 
possible 
see eternal destruction -- destruction . 
rev often 
use term `` second death '' . 
obvious understanding 
would seem final extinction . 
problem nt speak 
eternal punishment second death . 
i.e. use term 
understand either way . 
concern convince 
one view , help people understand 
wide enough variety image possible 
understand either way . 
tom albrecht comment , primary 
point best keep people eternal fire , 
whatever detail . 
make thing interesting , luke 20:35 
imply damned get resurrect . 
presumably 
stay dead . 
-- yes aware possible 
understand passage non-literal way . 
2 peter 2:4 - ff talk angel , talk hold 
hell final judgement . 
eternal . 
matthew -46 talk send curse eternal fire 
prepare devil angel . 
fact fire 
eternal mean people last flame forever . 
particularly interesting comment fire 
prepare devil angel . 
rev 20 21 talk 
eternal fire well . 
say beast false prophet 
torment forever . 
talk people 
throw 20:13 -14 , refer `` second death '' . 
sound like extinction eternal torment . 
possible 
fire different effect supernatural entity 
devil , human ? 
2 thessalonians 1:6 -10 similarly , `` everlasting destruction '' ? 
necessarily eternal torment . 
one clearly 
understand either way , think least possible think 
everlasting use contrast kind destruction 
occur life final destruction occur 
eternity . 
2 thessalonians 2:8 talk destruction . 
revelation -8 : see comment 
revelation -12 probably best quote . 
even , 
explicitly say people suffer forever . 
say 
smoke presumably fire eternal , 
respite . 
say people 
tormented forever . 
psalm 9:17 : see say anything relevant issue .
