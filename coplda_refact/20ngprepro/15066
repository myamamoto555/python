year ago find master cylinder clutch '84 
leak fluid around piston seal , lead air system fluid 
back passenger compartment car . 
pull plunger 
get rebuild kit new plunger , seal , etc. think problem 
lick . 
much surprise , problem develop several month 
later ! 
time look carefully master cylinder make sure 
scratch , burr , obvious cause problem . 

find . 
ever since periodically feed clutch 
additional fluid bleeding air system . 
know 
would sell car want go way solve 
problem . 
add clutch original , adjust 
pedal allow maximum extension piston master cylinder 
order actuate clutch . 
hypothesis mean fully depress clutch pedal , 
angle piston rod attach pedal 
cylinder , thus cock piston seal perhaps deform . 
think explanation ? 
suggest possible fix 
short replace master cylinder get new clutch put ? 
' 86 : problem , except diagnosis explain 
fluid leak way master cylinder , 
passenger compartment vacation 10 day , 
clutch pedal depressed otherwise cause distort .
