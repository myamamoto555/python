native language . 
know german germany , pick

koehler 's lexicon , 's concordance , jenni & westermann theological

really basis 
> comparison . 
amount language instruction available us seminary vary widely , 
mostly depend denominational heritage school . 
presbyterian 
reformed seminary probably place lot emphasis biblical 
language . 
course , divinity school doctoral 
program biblical study go extensive language resource ! 

quite seminary 
attitude seem , `` well , really interested 'll give 
semester-long course , understand ... '' 
pattern louisville presbyterian seminary first-year 
student take intensive five-week introductory language course 
language , follow semester-long exegesis course . 
: hebrew 
august , ot exegesis fall ; greek january , nt exegesis spring . 
course require graduation , third half student , 
would say , take advanced biblical work require language work .
