although , past continue disagree 
think worthwhile get alarm . 
> feature important ? 
think important protect trunk , engine bay , 
door . 
would get flash light , lead 's mount driver 
passenger door relay disable engine operation . 
toss 
glass break sensor , shock sensor . 
door lock unlock , 
two remote panic feature also nice . 
important installation ! 
place 
may cost little , poorly install alarm matter 
much cost major burden . 
> feature unimportant ? 
imo , thing like engine starter , voice alarm , open 
close , convenience .
