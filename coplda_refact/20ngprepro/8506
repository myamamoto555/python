complain maybe scsi expensive 
pc 's year two ago isa bus . 
ie one buy scsi isa isa slow 
say isa bus automatic winner 
compare ide ?

get different transfer rate ide change isa bus speed .

blow ide water , hand .

ide variant old ibm - mfm controller . 
least 
look software point view . 
never mean 
all-encompassing across different 
platform . 
argument 
ide transfer datum ide drive least fast 
drive able provide datum ? 
version ide drive able 
deliver higher sustained transfer rate scsi interface 
higher rpm platter , different arrangement head , etc ? 
?

get unix load one pc along os use one two ide drive one time . 
pretty ugly . 
datum go one drive another , scsi ability 
perform transfer without datum go cpu main 
memory , yes , optimal way . 
far know , ide 
. 
cpu want datum drive datum store 
main memory say scsi grab datum drive 
time datum main memory also 
time ? 
work 1 irq 1 dma channel isa whatever bus ?

friend mine get maxtor 245 meg ide drive $ 320 . 
245 
million byte , 234 . 
basic $ 20 interface , get 
close 1 transfer . 
figure include 
hundred $ $ $ scsi driver ?

common read :

say scsi would default interface type , 
consider vast majority pc 's cd-rom drive 
tape backup etc ? 
pc 's 1 hard drive 
run dos ? 
scsi hard drive cost lot mfm rll drive 
time ? 
common drive 80 meg 4 10 year 
ago ? 
lot lack common interface card 
prevent scsi become connection medium choice .

point , faster ? 
. 

get performance money . 
people 
single hard drive system regardless os scsi 
choice really give performance ide ?

true , also start bus , mean option 
cd-rom drive tape backup run card .

add many different type device access

argument . 
always hold first time buyer 
best reason . 
many scsi device first time buyer 
eventually acquire ? 
make sense go scsi single 
hard drive system ? 
> 2 . 
device work many different machine mac 
> pc home move hard drive nice 
> scsi -- hook away go 
posting ii spec , really sure 
pc apple scsi hard drive compatible ? 
even , 
datum accessible either machine ie formatting 
partitioning file table difference ? 
really plug 'n' play ?

scsi device work together better ide device .

c : drive connor become logical d : drive dos .

multitasking os ,

two ide drive system temporary file transfer , 
never see difference switching drive , 
ever see difference transfer file drive 
drive .

nice long power supply keep . 
believe

mysterious jumper figure . 
`` mysterious '' expensive driver figure ? 
least 
ide require driver consume precious conventional memory .
