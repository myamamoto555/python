well , observer x likely 's position b 's , 
agree b make appropriate observation inference 
regard situation , would expect conclude 
right answer . 
hopefully would factor would allow 
make judgement regard answer accept . 
, hand , disagree principle either b , 
suspect would make decision favor one . 
unfortunately case moral argument answer 
perspective . 
instance , completely unable come 
conclusion regard whether abortion allow , 
perspective . 
ideal world , live thing would right 
life ; ideal world , woman would absolute right 
like body . 
clearly way resolve 
favor principle . 
therefore agree compromise 
solution allow abortion certain time conception , 
decide time base various sometimes ill-defined criterion . 

also sensible move , think , let people make 
decision within reason . 
worth , reasonably happy 
current uk abortion law . 
similarly , situation left yugoslavia horrible mess , 
really see way sort conclusion . 
, even 
know enough imagine sort compromise one might manage .
