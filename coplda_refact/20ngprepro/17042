subject : make odd resistor value require filter 
organization : manchester computing centre 
lines : 14 
construct active filter , odd value resistor often require 
i.e. something like 3.14 k ohm resistor . 
seem best choose common 
capacitor value cope strange resistance demand . 
pd program work best make 
resistance , give fix resistor standard 12 value per decade ? 
. 
1 , 
etc . 
common enough problem , yet cant 
recall seing program tell rx + ry rz give rq , start 
q finding prefer value x , y z. 
cheers
