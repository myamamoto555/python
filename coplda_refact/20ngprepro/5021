would need , though , make sure nobody 
access decent crypto first place . 
probably 
tell voice voice 
get copy key . 
criminal go use 
encryption cover clipper . 
way avoid 
try prohibit strong encryption . 
probably say , could try detect use 
illegal cypher transmit clear statistical 
property plaintext . 
old-fashioned wiretap could 
detect use , would drastically increase 
measure entropy input . 
countermeasure would 
use technique put voice . 
tell nsa build feature : blow mike , 
observe whether band thug come ceiling .
