99.99 % sure subaru porsche use boxer configuration 
inline 4 crank analyze compare . 
would 
care re-evaluate case flat four ?

indeed . 
flat four also shorter inline 4 , even mount 
longitudinally take lot length . 
. 
longitudinal 
placement easier 4 wheel drive drivetrain . 
think subaru 's ad hold water . 
practice , flat fours 
noticeably smoother inline 4 completely buzz free , 
though may like peculiar note . 
alfa show , 
boxer four produce spine tingle scream likes 
recent honda approach .
