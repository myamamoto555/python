abstract : present new off-line electronic cash 
system base problem , call representation problem , 
little use make literature thus far . 
system 
first base entirely discrete logarithm . 
use 
representation problem basic concept , technique 
introduce enable construct protocol withdrawal 
payment use cut choose methodology earlier 
system . 
consequence , cash system much efficient 
computation communication complexity system 
propose previously . 
another important aspect system concern provability . 
contrary previously propose system , correctness 
mathematically prove great extent . 
specifically , 
make one plausible assumption concern single , 
ability break system seem imply one break 
diffie-hellman problem . 
system offer number extension hard achieve 
previously know system . 
opinion interesting 
entire cash system include extension 
incorporate setting base wallet observer , 
important advantage prevent 
first place , rather detect identity 
fact . 
particular , incorporate even 
stringent requirement conceivable privacy user , 
seem impossible previously propose system . 
another benefit system frame attempt bank 
negligible probability success independent compute power 
simple mechanism within system , something 
previous solution lack entirely . 
furthermore , basic cash system 
extend check , cash divisibility , 
retain computational efficiency . 

cryptographer challenge try break system ! 
make particular effort keep report self-contained 
possible . 
nevertheless , question , please e-mail 
try reply good . 
comment also 
welcome !
