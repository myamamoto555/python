clipper chip 's user key form : 
r1 e d e n1 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 
r2 e d e n2 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 
r3 e d e n3 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 
use ? 
gain effective 
increase defeat potential ? 
, use 
80 bit key ? 
know anything skipjack algorithm , 
really possible guess whether make harder easier 
guess s1 , s2 . 
n1 , n2 , n3 form ? 
would 
see skipjack algorithm , look way attack require 
three ciphertext block form odd way . 
constant value 
serial number form n1 , n2 , n3 come ? 
change chip 
chip , session session ? 
even publish ny times , 
skipjack resistant attack , use triple - 
encryption , break security . 
allow kind 
weird format ? 
three value bit , 
maybe use ensure attack skipjack , 
exist , easily use derive s1 s2 whole production 
run chip ... 
dorothy denning read group ? 
, someone group 
forwarding question like , martin hellman , anyone else 
see detail chip ?
