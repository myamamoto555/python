dma big deal , nothing

ide dma . 
like te pc hard disk 
interface . 
controller move sector buffer memory 
controller card , cpu move datum buffer main 
memory need . 
ide work way , 
compatible . 
heck , ide use dma , would hear kind complaint 
isa bus system 16m ram work ide 
drive . 
16m dma address limit isa bus , ide 
dma would trouble . 
btw , signal ide cable spec , 
last report hear never implement , 
would require different kind ide adapter different driver .
