front cover available sony . 
check local car 
stereo shop . 
probably definitely provide unit 
serial number hopefully register warranty card . 

know cost , replacement available people 
damage face cover , stand reason replace . 
deter theft : 
work stereo shop , refer customer sony 800 
number . 
would sell face , available . 

people come ask face cover pullout 
matter would look disheartened find acquire deck 
could use . 
theft occur deck , notify sony . 
serial 
number catch . 
thought ,
