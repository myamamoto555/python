never think two idea `` '' . 
people might quibble `` intrinsically '' mean 
reason sinner behave good 
. 
message christ good , 
great , approach perfection , albeit perhaps 
different technique claim buddhism teach . 

realize greatness , sin . 
peter problem walk 
water little doubt creep . 
david ask 8th psalm `` man god 
care , make little lower 
angel '' ? 
probably mind scrawny little kid david 
, probably gigantic monster goliath 
, david 's power easily defeat goliath 's . 
remember rich young man come jesus ask 
enter kingdom , jesus say follow commandment . 
always picture smug look face say 
whole life , probably anticipate `` attaboy '' 
messiah . 
instead jesus give harder task , sell everything 
follow . 
jesus raise bar . 
say 
anyone hard even rich people . 
jesus say anyone , god 's help . 
jesus say avoid kill people , avoid 
get angry people . 
avoid commit 
adultery , control desire . 
realize main point , wonder 
people see .

please forgive generalization make . 
point `` hard '' religion good one , 
`` parting question '' tough question . 
think muslims 
worship god , learn name `` submission '' . 
hindus buddhists taoists , etc. claim `` god '' impersonal . 
god personal impersonal ? 
say yes , think little 
answer whichever greater . 
think greater 
personal entity , individual consciousness , 
right might cultural bias . 
think 
must admit god 's personal nature far beyond 
conception impersonal nature beyond hindu 's 
conception . 
somehow jesus could fit hindu cosmology 
maybe would problem , though hard imagine . 
former present `` eastern religion '' member 
could comment ?
