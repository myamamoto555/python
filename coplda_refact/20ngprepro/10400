compare pentium 
spec 68040 fill 500 page book . 
highlight ... 
32-bit address space w 32-bit datum width . 
18 32-bit integer register 
& 8 80-bit float point register . 
8k capable cache , 
4-way set associative . 
typical 1.2 instruction . 
5 
clock floating point multiply . 
interesting aside : 68040 multiply two 80-bit float point 
number less time multiply two 32-bit integer 
> 2 spec estimate cost , release date , etc. . 
. 
multiple instruction dispatch . 
figure 
0.8 clock per instruction typical guess . 
motorola 
guy pretty bright , may less .

technical info . 
call motorola . 
typing . 
> hope 68040 win yet another battle intel people . 
predict x86 line reach 
end . 
new experimental processor 64-bit datum pathway 
schedule 8 32 instruction clock cycle . 
sort 
trick really cisc architecture . 
finally see detail greatly 
impressed . 
finally work fpu get 
speed , otherwise go 2x speedup . 
get 
use two integer unit , larger cache , branch 
target buffer . 
yes , know talk 100mhz processor . 
big whoop . 
designing 100mhz board difficult really 
expensive . 
price 15n memory chip lately ?
