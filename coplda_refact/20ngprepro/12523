big difference status refer 
alexandrian actually , include oriental orthodox church 
copts nestorian . 
oriental orthodox 
church never even `` shelter '' advocator monophysitism 
contrary , condemn still condemn 
heresy . 
chalcedonian orthodox church hold 
talk oriental non-chalcedonian start 30 year ago 
still continue till today , converge many 
issue christology 
detail dialogue , case anyone interested . 
see `` alexandrians '' nestorian 
similar position . 
peace ,
