often get discussion christian . 
unfortunately 
number possible definition . 
start 
broadest , commonly used definition : 
historical definition 
people accept christ lord savior 
broad doctrinal definition 
narrow doctrinal definition 
1 historical definition mean sort definition secular 
historian would likely use . 
would include group 
develop christian church , continue within 
broad culture . 
e.g. unitarians would fail 
doctrinal test could come . 
yet clear group 
develop christianity , people different 
background e.g. hindus would likely see part 
christianity . 
definition christian like , 
relevant political ethnic context . 
2 accept christ lord savior test use many 
christian group membership , e.g. southern baptists 
presbyterian church usa . 
would qualify say 
people mind exclusive commitment christ , 
someone accept christ one many god would fit . 

attempt formulate criterion religious base 
technical doctrine . 
definition , group arians 
would view heretical christian , still christian . 

modern context would include mormons , jw 's , `` oneness 
pentecostal '' . 
would view heretical christian , 
still christian . 
practice believe everyone fall 
category would accept apostle 's creed . 
3 next level attempt give broad doctrinal definition , 
include major strand christianity , exclude 
group feel outside `` historic christianity . '' 

course slippery enterprise , since catholics could argue 
protestants outside historic christianity , etc. . 
think 
commonly accept definition would base something like 
nicene creed chalcedon . 
attempt 
characterize doctrine major strand christianity agree 
key . 
obviously extent matter judgement . 

mormon regard ld church major strand , thus 
want include anything contradict belief . 
think 
definition would fairly broad acceptance . 
4 finally , people use definition would say limit 
specific christian tradition . 
e.g. evangelical 
consider someone christian 
conversion experience , even hear group limit 
specific church . 
think find context definition use . 
lot go depend upon purpose use . 

use descriptively , e.g. history anthropology , ` ll 
probably use definition 1 2 . 
use normatively , i.e. 
say believe christian message , 'll probably use 
definition like 3 even 4 .
