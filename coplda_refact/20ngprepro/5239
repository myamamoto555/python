subject : remove distortion bitmapped drawings ? 
organization : 
lines : 47 
let 's say scan image line drawing ; case 
boat , could anything . 
draw set 
reference point whose true x , y position know . 
digitize drawing manually case , use yaron 
danon 's excellent digitize program . 
, use program 
convert cursor position x , y save value click 
mouse . 
upon digitize notice reference point value come 
digitize process differ small significant way 
known true value . 
understandable 
scan drawing reproduction original 
successive source distortion differential expansion 
contraction paper , error introduce printing process , 
scanner error . 
error uniform entire drawing , `` global '' 
adjustment uniformly x y , 
rotate whole drawing , satisfactory . 
question : kind soul know algorithm 
remove distortion ? 
particular , three set 
point 
reference x , y know true value 
x , y point , known error 
x , y point , unknown error 
function reference distorted could apply 
remove error . 
suspect problem could solve treat distorted 
reference point result projection `` bumpy '' 3d 
surface , solve surface `` flatten '' remove 
error datum point . 
kind inform soul idea , better yet , 
pointer treatment similar problem ? 
thanks , 
earl
