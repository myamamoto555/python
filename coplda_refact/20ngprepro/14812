rational person would concentrate motor vehicle death , attempt 
affect childhood fall , drowning , gunshot injury , etc. 
call rational person , use definition , 
attempt affect lead cause death adult aged 25 
64 would worry cancer , would try decrease 
lesser cause heart disease , injury , stroke , suicide , liver disease , 
chronic lung disease , homicide , hiv infection , diabetes . 
oh , okay charles , 
make lot sense . 
tell charles , 'll call heart 
foundation suicide hotline tell act rational 
go home address lesser cause 
death . 
call local police homicide department , liver foundation 
diabetes foundation tell stop address lesser cause .

accident , suicide , homicide .

wound child age 16 nearly double major urban area 
1987 1990 . '' 
also doubt american academy pediatrics charles ???
