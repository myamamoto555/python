| theism correlate fanaticism . 
neither say 
| cause theism theism lead . 
point , 
| theism increase chance become fanatic . 
one could course 
| argue would fanatic tend towards theism example , 
| time history theism dominant ideology 
| invalidate conclusion basic mechanism behind . 
imo , influence stalin , matter , ayn rand , invalidate 
assumption theism factor consider . 
gullibility , 
blind obedience authority , lack scepticism , , 
reliable indicator . 
really dangerous people - source 
fanaticism - often none thing . 
cynical manipulator 
gullible , know precisely . 
, 
brand theism , precisely theist , tend fanaticism , 
grant . 
tar theist brush bigotry , reason 
argument - read like warm-up censorship restriction 
religious freedom . 
ever read animal farm ?

| irrational belief belief base upon reason . 
latter 
| discuss long time charley wingate . 
one point 
| belief violate reason often , another process 
| lend rational analysis contain reliable information . 
well , glaring paradox : argument reason useful 
base reason would circular , argument base reason would 
irrational . 
? 
first part second statement contain information , 
say `` belief '' . 
`` belief '' strong theism 
strong atheism , statement general true . 

second part sentence patently false - counterexample : 
axiomatic datum lend rational analysis , 
assume contain reliable information regardless process 
use obtain . 
| compare evidence theist claim strength 
| demand make whole thing irrational . 
agree specific - theism ? 

say theism necessarily require proof 
suspect . 
| affinity easily see . 
true believe 
| nothing work hypothesis . 
however , belief say 
| work hypothesis . 
understand . 
formalise argument ?
