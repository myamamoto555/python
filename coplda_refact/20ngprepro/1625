purchase viewsonic 17 orchid . 
short , happy 
monitor unhappy card . 
spend lot time 
card , go write . 
monitor 
pretty . 
moire simcity 17 '' magnavox go away . 

heavy think would 45 lb , think . 
much 
monitor . 
bitch session test result . 
go modern trend , orchid card support 16 color 
640x480 mode without driver . 
course , break program 
use svga mode like cd-rom . 
whiplash vga , 
orchid fahrenheit 1280 , orchid f. vlb share limitation . 

s3 card , mean s3 problem use 
vga chip also support . 
hercules graphite 
card seem mode , run test case 
board brief time . 
able 
print splash screen grolier 's encyclopedia , though , s3 
card print hash , suspect svga mode support . 
support resolution really annoy . 

tell driver nec six monitor 
list plus ` generic ' , choose generic get high 
refresh . 
1024x768 limit . 
seem 
hardware able support bandwidth 
1280 sure able 1024 ! 
. 
higher vertical resolution 
main reason buy card orchid f. vlb currently , 
hz well . 
higher graphic mode crash hp dashboard . 
get phone 
orchid , 1.1 driver know unable 
recreate problem . 
plus side , tech rep helpful 
could boot program computer verify 
problem . 
know limit refresh 70 hz either . 
board faster thing accord hercules 
speedy program . 
program test various operation report result 
. 
number graphite card , 
close half ie , slower run 
386 , isa , number really comparable . 
follow number 
obtain use 486 , 33 mhz , air motherboard umc chipset , 
8 mb memory . 
give range program report number 
compute , tend jump around bit . 
k mean thousand 1024 , m mean million , pixel per second 
orchid fahrenheit vlb orchid 
chip s3 805 9000 
dib screen - - 
memory screen 5.9 m - 6.2 m 8.4 m - 8.9 m

dib screen test take device independent bitmap face transfer 
screen . 
idea internally far 
conversion go . 
memory screen take face copy 
screen , guess bitmap 
copy video display . 
screen screen test copy 
face place place screen . 
awesome ! 
interestingly , solid 
vector shaded polygon show improvement , hatch polygon ie , 
fill cross-hatching ternary rop whatever . 
graphic 
operation like xor maybe ???? 
dead loss 9000 . 
give two 
number 9000 font , think cache . 
font first draw screen fairly slowly -- 
speed . 
speed increase dramatically . 
sound 
like program benchmark ... 
make claim number mean anything . 

see run computer . 
normally write disclaimer , 
time maybe would better . 
testing totally unconnected 
work program unix completely without 
knowledge , blessing , equipment company .
