wonder many atheist care speculate face world 
atheist majority rather minority group population . 
rather ridiculous question way , know , newsreader 
get new posting bit , figure might 
well post something new . 
also , many atheist would actually take stance accor 
higher value way think theistic way thinking . 

typical selfish argument would line think evolve 
inherent motivation , one , intrinsically , different 
, qualitatively . 
measure stick must draw 
somewhere , assign value system belief core , 
alternative apply periphery ; ie , 
express selfishness . 
idle thought ...
