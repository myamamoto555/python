want get semantic argument , contrary 
posting `` near uv light '' `` actual uv light . '' 
`` near '' mean 
close visible spectrum i.e. relatively long wavelength , 
`` nearly uv . '' 
sure figure 
`` far uv '' . 
regular flashlight bulb emit tiny amount uv 
near end spectrum , filter use remove 
visible light thus create weak uv source . 
stronger source 
go require gas probably mercury vapor discharge tube 
fluorescent tube uv phosphor . 
careful , though ; strong uv 
source cause physiological damage , especially eye . 

shorter wavelength dangerous . 
would project beam like flashlight , replace tube 
portable fluorescent lantern uv tube would relatively 
cheap way create portable source . 
would bright enough 
useful , dangerously .
