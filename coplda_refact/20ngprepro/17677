, put conductor change magnetic field , produce voltage . 
two way permanent magnet move magnet 
move conductor . 
slow shift earth 's magnetic field 
really significant , especially consider weak earth 's magnetic 
field begin .

well , would require generate incredibly large magnetic field repel 
earth 's magnetic field magnet repel another magnet . 
course , 
force work one direction , magnetic field generate 
unimaginably powerful . 
magnetic repulsion drop ^ 3 , 
earth 's magnetic field surface already weak . 
would require 
sort unknown superconductor , special nonmagnetic construction . 
seriously electronics optical computer , perhaps . 

physiological danger would significant due iron content 
blood , among thing . 
word , forget .

miss `` satellite '' thread , sound totally bogus , 
little bit .
