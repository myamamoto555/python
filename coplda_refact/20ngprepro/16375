people seem perfectly capable 
> deal . 
well , yeah , unlike tiff substantially encode 
rectangular bitmap . 
hardly trouble free . 
hear 
quite common cgm implementation interoperate . 
annoying thing tiff along 50 useful 
option , 100 stupid option . 
egregious example 
rather pick byte order bit order use consistently 
tiff file , byte bit order option tiff reader 
machine , matter natural byte order , prepare 
byte swap . 
four slightly different fax format -- 
, one would adequate . 
rgb image store 
pixel component , complexity without function , etc , etc. . 
also 
note tiff doc say aldus ' experiment show lzw reliably 
compress well better fax format , suggest 
none fax format really useful . 
worse , lot format even implement well , 
e.g. , lzw limit code word 12 bit , 14 16 bit would 
provide substantially better compression . 
lzw method compress 
byte rather pixel . 
absolute worst thing tiff vendor register 
proprietary tiff code format without even publicly document . 
mean way write tiff reader reliably 
read incoming tiff file . 
standard .
