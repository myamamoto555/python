rather thoroughly demolish myth robert scott root - 
bernstein . 
see book , `` discover '' . 
ring structure benzene 
propose ' , , time . 
current model resemble 's . 
many predecessor 
's structure resemble modern model . 
think `` '' useful phrase discussion 
boundary science , except propose . 

better phrase . 
fact , quite number well-known case 
consideration drive science useful direction . 
example , pasteur discover racemic acid mixture 
enantiomer origin stereochemistry partly like 
friend 's crank theory chemical action . 
friend wrong , 
pasteur 's discovery stand . 
prior investigator mitscherlich , look 
phenomenon , miss crucial detail ; presumably 
lack pasteur 's motivation find something distinguish racemic 
acid tartaric say : acid . 
, pasteur discover differential fermentation enantiomer 
tartaric acid rational conviction , 
try produce yeast live acid . 
notebook 
contain fantasy become `` newton mirror-image life , '' 
never admit publically . 
perhaps best example discovery dna carry gene . 
avery 
start work one student , ardent anglophile 
canadian , defend fred griffiths ' discovery mouse . 
griffiths ' critic french , decide issue 
student . 
avery tell replicate griffiths ' work vitro , 
student eventually , whereupon avery convinced start 
research program , 15 year , produce famous discovery 
avery , macleod , mccarty , jem 1944 .
