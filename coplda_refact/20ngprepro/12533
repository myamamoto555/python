dictionary cult use classify `` new age '' , 
basically hindu orientation . 
headquarters 
write lama foundation , identify `` new 
age commune '' san , new mexico . 
information might 
read alpert 's book , list `` '' 
autobiography , `` dance '' , `` grist mill '' . 
deal briefly citation give `` larson , new book , pp 
'' . 
assume bob larson , `` larson 's new book cults '' . 
would warn however whole approach `` new age '' 
controversial . 
source reference book use , well 
bob larson , believe satanic new age conspiracy , regard 
hysterical . 
however least , seem clear 
christian group .
