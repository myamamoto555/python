definitely wrong newsgroup , never mind . 
machine power heat motor , steam - , , 
, etc work better , bigger temperature difference 
input output . 
never get thermic energy 
power medium steam , burn gaz , etc , eliminate rest 
energy keep high . 
thermal electric power plant coal , 
oil atomic power work way . 
heat water steam power 
turbine generator . 
get whole energy 
steam never 100 % cool steam 
something else . 
power plant use cool tower purpose 
type ... . 
use water river ecologically 
unobjectionable . 
get ? 
cheers robert
