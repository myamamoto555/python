believe whiten good aquisition cards . 

much offensive capability , awesome defensively .

agree one . 
soon larkin throw ball , know 
lankford dead bird . 
could dent know larkin would make 
perfect throw ? 
strongly believe torre one best manager baseball . 

forget overachieving cards '91 win close game go 
last place second place although braves 
twin last first climb . 
win division title , barely lose pennant 
race braves atlanta ever even consider firing 
never understand . 
torre control , cardinals head 
right direction . 
one thing , one game make season . 
yes , lose red , 
second best pitch staff national league first 
east , pretty good offense , redbirds win lot 
lose . 
maybe year go way . 
charles , enthusiastic fan
