clipper chip : technical summary 
dorothy denning 
revise , april 21 , 1993 
. 
. 
. 
clipper chip contain classified 64-bit block 
encryption algorithm call `` skipjack . '' 
algorithm use 80 bit key 
compare 56 des 32 round scramble 
compare 16 des . 
support 4 des mode 
operation . 
algorithm take 32 clock tick , electronic 
codebook ecb mode run 12 mbit per second . 
chip include follow component : 
skipjack encryption algorithm 
f , 80-bit family key common chip 
n , 30-bit serial number length subject change 
u , 80-bit secret key unlock message encrypt chip 
. 
. 
. 
encrypt chip 
see chip use , imagine embed at&t 
telephone security device . 
suppose call someone 
device . 
push button start secure 
conversation , security device negotiate 80-bit session key k 
device end . 
key negotiation take place 
without clipper chip . 
general , method key exchange 
use diffie-hellman public-key distribution method . 
session key k establish , clipper chip use 
encrypt conversation message stream m digitized voice . 

telephone security device feed k m chip produce two 
value : 
e m ; k , encrypted message stream , 
e e k ; u + n ; f , law enforcement field , 
transmit telephone line . 
law enforcement 
field thus contain session key k encrypt unit key u 
serial number n , encrypt family 
key f. law enforcement field decrypt law enforcement 
authorize wiretap install . 
------------------ 
suppose know algorithm work know n chip , 
know f , cryptanalysis might able determine f 
law enforcement field 
e e k ; u + n ; f 
know n would might make much harder . 
suppose know f , either legitimately , 
know k either involve conversation , know u 
party conversation , may able determine u 
party . 
know f also defeat law enforcement field , since could 
make , different k one use . 
know f also 
allow traffic analysis perform . 
might know 
say could know say . 
admit someone try compute u lot 
message work , since way know key 
generation method deliberately ? 
generate weak key , 
matter publish method fact use , perhaps u 's 
choose know weak key system . 
obviously compromise f would disaster , law enforcement 
whole thing design , people believe 
give security . 
f one number , sure alot 
people 1 know `` panel expert '' 
go check flaw many know f , forget 
grind chip , bribery blackmail work fine . 
, wrong ? 
problem .
