oh well , corroded battery , feel

major problem reaction take place acid solution . 
soluble acid solution precipitate . 
also , h2so4 
water solution + so4 -- . 
thus heat formation 
h2so4 part irrelevant .

turn reaction indeed exothermic heat producing . 
later . 
actually happen make battery completely useless : 
talk lead-acid battery course 
battery slowly self discharge . 
discharge take place two thing 
happen . 
- level pb + + ion acid solution increase i.e. lead 
lead oxide plate dissolve . 
- level + ion acid solution decrease i.e. solution 
become less acidic , like water like . 
, post respond correctly state , precipitate 
water solution . 
battery die i.e. fully discharge 
end high concentration pb + + so4 -- water . 

form solution fall bottom battery course 
happen vary degree , discharge , precipitate form . 
precipitate form conductive layer bottom battery . 

enough lead lead oxide plate leave touch precipitate 
common newer battery dead short result . 
see product automotive shop correct condition , 
part useless . 
dissolve restore 
lead lead oxide plate properly . 
may success 
product newer battery .

stuff make author completely invalid . 
fact discharge reaction take place higher rate higher 
temperature . 
logical consequence argument : 
`` really want car start , lower battery temperature 
-50 ` pull ' reaction along . '' 
know experience 
least canada get cold 
true . 
want start car really cold day warm 
battery . 
besides , enough energy release self discharge 
appreciably raise temperature . 
air would amply dissipate 
heat , whether bottom battery insulate . 

course irrelevant , since would want battery cool 
storage . 
keep battery cool dry place keep charge !
