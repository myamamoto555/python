whoa . 
effectively imply player play 
really well , ` store ' mistake use later time . 
th 
. 
roy ` villain ' , succinctly put , 
allow cheap goal . 
think roy outplay hextall , perhaps 
get tape game watch first 7-8 minute third 
period . 
nhl goaltender _ make _ great save . 
, 
would nhl first place . 
expect particular 
goalie able make great save time , even though 
occasionally require . 
however , come routine shot like 
sakic 's , especially crucial time game , think 
legitimate excuse . 
> hextall , hand , lot lucky bounce 
> description lucky bounce ... 
> hextall particularly brilliant play ... 
argue hextall brilliant . 
argue 
relatively weak wrist shot outside circle result 
goal .

timing stank ,

> powerplay totally unnecessary . 
one-goal game less minute go thing 
` 1 goal ' . 
defend dionne take penalty 
either ... fact think boneheaded move . 
lead _ one _ goal 
, montreal _ two _ goal lead . 
main concern second 
goal . 
> certainly team loss ... leclair miss opportunity , 
> bellows brunet . 
dionne take bad penalty . 
damphousse lebeau

carbonneau savard step behind night . 
roy give 
> bad goal . 
roy , means , single loss . 
say skater absolutely true . 
realize 
game effectively win . 
could watch hockey game fact , 
could watch sport event period spend hour discuss ` 
's ' miss opportunity . 
important final 
result decide . 
get time soon , 'll watch game 
email list lucky montreal bounce list quebec offensive 
screwup . 
montreal _ lead _ minute go . 
goalie 
last line defense , grant extra attention 
focus , sometimes without justification . 
roy give lousy 
goal , team afford goal . 
roy look like player industrial league sakic 's shot . 
> hextall dionne 's goal ? 
please . 
care ? 
value justify one lousy play totally 
unrelated lousy play ? 
could hextall critique would like . 

go assess performance , keep mind make key 
save key time . 
> roy pay big money 
> value compare goalie ... still top 5 
record , say roy one top goaltender 
league . 
fact , agree . 
> montreal media quickest heap praise hurl derogatory 
> comment habs . 
better uninformed fan . 
assume refer . 
however , point think 
loss blame roy . 
say suck , think ` ve 
make ` derogatory comment ' .

inform , fyi observation derogatory , really help .
