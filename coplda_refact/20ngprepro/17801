would say extent roman catholic church 
neither approve disapprove capital punishment , 
confirm recent catechism , though many rc 
rather surprised upset capital punishment 
explicitly condemn . 
, catholic , see opposition capital 
punishment much opposition abortion - 
reverence life . 
uk , anti-abortion case 
often let explicit link 
political left make 
. 
tendency condemn people 
hold view hypocrite . 
feel many 
also vocal opposition 
capital punishment pro-life line , would end 
kneejerk association anti-abortion right-wing thing , 
get many think seriously issue 
plenty equally kneejerk left-wing 
reason . 
think biblical quote automatically take 
support capital punishment . 
take roman 
catholic oppose abortion , would still 
wrong , something object even legalise 
`` authority '' .
