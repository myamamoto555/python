clipper chip : technical summary 
dorothy denning 
april 19 , 1993 
introduction 
april 16 , president announce new initiative bring 
together federal government industry voluntary program 
provide secure communication meet legitimate need 
law enforcement . 
heart plan new encryption 
chip call `` clipper chip '' together approach 
escrow key . 
two escrow agency use , key part 
need reconstruct key . 
chip structure 
clipper chip contain classified 64-bit block encryption 
algorithm call `` skipjack . '' 
algorithm use 80 bit key compare 
56 des 32 round scramble compare 16 
des . 
support 4 des mode operation . 
throughput 
16 mbit second . 
chip include follow component : 
skipjack encryption algorithm 
f , 80-bit family key common chip 
n , 30-bit serial number 
u , 80-bit secret key unlock message encrypt chip 
encrypt chip 
see chip use , imagine embed at&t 
telephone security device . 
suppose call someone 
device . 
push button start secure 
conversation , security device negotiate session key k 
device end general , method key exchange 
use . 
key k message stream m i.e. , digitized voice 
feed clipper chip produce two value : 
e m ; k , encrypted message stream , 
e e k ; u + n ; f , law enforcement block . 
law enforcement block thus contain session key k encrypt 
unit key u serial number n , 
encrypt family key f. 
chip programming escrow 
clipper chips program inside scif secure computer 
information facility , essentially vault . 
scif contain 
laptop computer equipment program chip . 
300 chip 
program single session . 
scif located 
. 
beginning session , trust agent two key 
escrow agency enter vault . 
agent 1 enter 80-bit value s1 
laptop agent 2 enter 80-bit value s2 . 
value 
serve seed generate key sequence serial number . 
generate unit key serial number n , 30-bit value n 
first pad fix block produce 64-bit block n1 . 
s1 s2 use key n1 , produce 
64-bit block r1 : 
r1 e d e n1 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 . 
similarly , n pad two block produce n2 
n3 , two additional 64-bit block r2 r3 compute : 
r2 e d e n2 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 
r3 e d e n3 ; s1 ; s2 ; s1 . 
r1 , r2 , r3 together , give 192 bit . 

first 80 bit assign u1 second 80 bit u2 . 

rest discard . 
unit key u xor u1 u2 . 
u1 u2 
key part separately escrow two escrow 
agency . 
sequence value u1 , u2 , u generate , 
write onto three separate floppy disk . 
first disk contain 
file serial number contain corresponding key part 
u1 . 
second disk similar contain u2 value . 
third 
disk contain unit key u. agent 1 take first disk agent 
2 take second disk . 
third disk use program chip . 
chip program , information discard 
vault agent leave . 
laptop may destroy additional 
assurance information leave behind . 
protocol may change slightly four people 
room instead two . 
first two would provide seed s1 s2 , 
second two escrow agent would take disk back 
escrow agency . 
escrow agency yet determine , 
nsa , cia , fbi , law enforcement agency . 
one 
may independent government . 
law enforcement use 
law enforcement authorize tap encrypted line , 
first take warrant service provider order get 
access communication line . 
let assume tap 
place determine line encrypt 
clipper . 
first decrypt law enforcement block 
family key f. give e k ; u + n. take 
warrant identify chip serial number n key escrow 
agent get back u1 u2 . 
u1 u2 together produce 
unit key u , e k ; u decrypt get session key k. 
finally message stream decrypt . 
accomplish 
special black box decoder operate fbi . 
acknowledgment distribution notice . 
information base 
information provide nsa , nist , fbi . 
permission 
distribute document grant .
