anything bring closer god sin . 
think strict , consider ambiguous . 
imply stay sin . 
christian 
never satisfy . 
imply 
fun sin . 
imply sleep sin . 
imply sin every day . 
perhaps simpler definition : 
anything counter two great commandment : 
love god , love neighbor , sin . 
anything love sin . 
action sin sometimes sin sometimes . 
could yell kid discipline , time love , 
consider teach proper behavior , could yell 
kid anger selfishness . 
could post excellent article interested share 
opinion get feedback learning , could post 
article want everyone realize wise .
