guess would react rather strongly line think carry 
! 
think `` army '' stronger `` mine '' , would 
`` righteously '' take child baptize , know 
really `` best '' . 
possibly put kind action , crusade 
context teaching . 
think advocate different 
approach design make appealing , call , 
choose church practice . 
seem cause effect switch , change come 
get baptize .
