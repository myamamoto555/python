concrete floor accelerate problem heat sink 
colder lead-acid battery self-discharge slightly faster rate . 

old wife ' tale sit piece wood floor work 
help keep kill battery fast -- insulate battery 
thermally . 
'll set battery piece styrofoam , 
self-discharge even slower . 
best thing would attach small load 
small transistor radio volume turn low leave 
constantly , also every couple day `` shallow - 
cycle '' charge battery . 
mild `` exercise '' lead-acid 
battery next best thing completely remove electrolyte 
storage . 
remove electrolyte , may sure keep separate storage 
container cell 's electrolyte put back cell 
refill battery . 
critical brand-new battery 
fully charge state , maximize restore output older 
battery may fully charge remove electrolyte 
storage .
