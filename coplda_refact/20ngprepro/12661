? 
curious , since believe first time ever make . 
repetition would imply much seeming inability 
understand ; ask question , 'll give 
answer , especially case , know answer true . 

best give everyone courtesy reply , everyone 
make point , push time , try respond 
believe strongest formulation point . 

include post , tough ; usenet , life tough .

drop debate poster continue . 
appear 
issue every n month , start beginning 
. 
debate issue twice , occasionally t.a. 
first response simon 's positive assertion 
disagreement moral value inexorably acknowledge moral 
relative . 
. 
, simon drop debate 
time ; take mean either busy , bore 
topic . 
certainly accuse dishonesty .

understand time . 
usually , one ask

usually , one . 
usually clear , sometimes 
ask mean ; time seem get extremely uptight 
feel debate line noise . 
sometimes get tired , 
sometimes thing would rather . 
, usenet , 
life tough .

's suppose threat ? 
, simple statement , assertion answerable 
offer baseless insult . 
example , accuse 
lie personal belief , also complain answer 
question .

one , claim everyone sens 
found , ask give evidence often . 
, correct statement would reason assume 
unless evidence find . 
problem second statement . 
provide 
argument almost everyone sens freedom valuable - 
cogent objection come jon livesey , offer 
people : essentially , people disagree 
fuzzy concept freedom . 
good point , think 
.

`` trick '' say : feel better b 
almost disinterested person ask . 
best evidence therefore 
really better b , subject assumption 
establish mutual satisfaction mean b , 
result system value self-consistent . 
get : `` really better '' idealisation , fictional model , 
sense `` real material existence '' fictional model . 

may may correspond something true . 
nonetheless useful 
_ assumption _ . 
far useful equally assume relativist 
`` trick '' , wit : 
feel better b , almost disinterested person 
ask . 
however , even one person disagree better b , 
even one person dissent mutually agreed definition b , 
case b better person , nothing 
say . 
say useless inexorably imply supermajority 
seek maximize morally take action someone seek 
maximize b e.g. terrorist . 
would claim 
supermajority 's carefully consider morality would better 
terrorist 's - would , course , true , no-no ethical 
relativist . 
claim ethical relativism imply anything else 
simply weasel word , example rival 
anything world religion .

long provide evidence 
something universally agree upon reason 
hypothesis . 
: freedom , proviso still 
answer jon 's objection fuzzy concept like freedom 
objective meaning . 
, order make morality absolute , universal , objective , 
would show independent human , attribute 
look quite misleading . 
really . 
evidence _ anything _ exist independently 
human ? 
'll hard press find logically 
equivalent apply value .

. 
moral matter belief far . 
people still believe 
way main entrance . 
agreement belief . 
order analogy would show 
way method convince everyone 
shortest way indeed . 
word , analogy work 
assume premise right first place . 
, 
#a fallacy . 
argument objectivism , would right . 
, 
though , demonstration argument give neither argument 
objectivism , argument relativism . 
gimmick 
assume first place value real , use `` prove '' 
value real . 
word , beg question .
