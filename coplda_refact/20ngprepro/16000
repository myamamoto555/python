'll agree wife . 
student , doctor remove 
rather surprising amount wax ear flush couple 
time , usually examine ear reason , 
say something like `` gee , get lot wax '' . 
case , 
removal large wax buildup noticeably improve hearing , 
since get habit wife flush 
warm water little rubber bulb every month . 
buy little 
bulb together ear drop express purpose drug store - 
notice drop accomplish much anything . 
one question - doctor flush ear also advocate 
drop rub alcohol afterwards flush remain 
trap water - say tell swimmer swimming , . 

work , sting like devil , always content let 
water ear swim flush figure get 
shake head time trick .
