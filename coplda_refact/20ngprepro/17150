vs. share windows discussion 
organization : ohio state university , department physics 
lines : 110 
would like see serious discussion best way install window 
novell administrator 's point view . 
get phone m access support tell 
microsoft decide implement , standard software support , 
local setup describe `` advantageous installation '' . 
true microsoft deem prudent installation 
comply would like hear administrator first . 
local windows installation : 
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
windows fully install workstation hard drive assume 
resource available . 
network administrator 's implementation , 
would install window disk network drive use . 
install window basis run setup network 
install complete system local drive . 
way , driver 
available setup procedure need change disk . 
advantage : 
- reduce traffic - run windows locally reduce network traffic due 
local access main windows file . 
- network independence - network fail one point 
another , local installation would allow user keep produce 
reduce cost . 
- faster windows - theoretically , windows run faster local hard 
drive network . 
may hard point prove network 
optical backbone network drive significantly faster 
access local one . 
- user travel machine machine need worry 
vary setup monochrome , color , type mouse , etc. . 
. 
since 
windows installation assign workstation . 
disadvantage : 
- cost - install windows locally require significant amount disk 
space . 
workstation must purchase hard disk 
increase cost workstation 10 30 percent . 
- administration - local window installation difficult 
administer . 
new driver peripheral constantly make available , 
would individually install workstation . 
- security - user access erase corrupt system 
file simple ignorance . 
could result quite headache 
administrator may constantly repair damaged installation . 
- backup - know problem back local hard disk . 
backup 
set via centralized tape system get large quickly . 
backup individually floppy may happen . 
may 
eliminate assume local hard disk contain replaceable 
application user datum . 
shared windows installation 
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
windows fully install network disk via procedure 
describe . 
user administrator install minimal set 
file individual `` user '' directory . 
directory may 
local hard disk perhaps network `` home '' directory . 
bulk 
windows system file maintain network single directory 
400 + file access share as-needed user throughout 
windows session . 
user 's file consist small set file 
user update windows session . 
include 
group file , . 
ini file regularly update file . 
advantage : 
- single location file make update drive easy . 

update driver become available , need install 
single directory user able take advantage . 
- assume user ' file maintain network home directory , 
administrator easily edit . 
ini file as-needed correct 
problem may arise . 
include win.ini . 
- backup pertinent file easily . 
even user ' file 
local hard disk , bulk windows system back 
driver update . 
disadvantage : 
- network traffic - since windows file share network 
directory , traffic network become problem effect 
speed windows . 
- network crash , production come stop since window 's 
reliant upon network file . 
loss datum usually occur 
well since user work windows time crash 
usually able save work . 
- although minimal , disk space still consideration . 
user ' file 
maintain network , large number user cause 
significant utilization disk space due personal windows 
file alone . 
- user easily move machine machine unless workstation 
hardware similar . 
due windows installation 
tie particular username case network user file . 
discussion 
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
would like know , administrator large windows 
userbase , prefer set windows . 
personally , 
setup numerous installation use share setup . 
windows 
application file network little utilization 
local hard disk . 
fact , sell network fact 
company would longer need purchase hard disk workstation 
thus save much money . 
would also like see recommendation application . 

app word excel install locally regardless 
windows install ? 
, keep file network easy 
backup administration `` put egg one basket '' ; 
network crash , work come halt . 
sure microsoft know 
idea insight would great value hope 
hear people `` actual '' work experience user network 
administration .
