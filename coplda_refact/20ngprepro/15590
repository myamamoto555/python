certainly . 
reference follow . 
bear mind least two condition may call 
color blind . 
one , , cause lack major 
dysfunction l cone , respond best long 
wavelength . 
give much reduce discrimination 
also mean red look dimmer people normal vision . 
, , due miss dysfunctional m cone although 
also cause lack cone difference signal retina . 
also give reduce discrimination unaffected . 
unlike , red dimmer normal . 
uniform chromaticity diagram - horseshoe shape one see computer 
graphic book - single confusion point type color 
deficiency . 
colours confuse lie straight line radiate 
point . 
point u ' 0.61 , v ' 0.51 , close far red 
corner . 
, point u ' , v ' 1.31 
note different experimental investigation literature give slightly 
different value depend precise detail experimental 
setup , random error , . 
value quote typical . 
color line see , color actually see ? 
problem solve . 
test people one normal eye one 
affect eye show axis type disorder onto 
color collapse . 
join 
spectral locus edge horseshoe ; line 
similar , join . 
convert color normal vision simulated 
: 
1 plot color uniform chromaticity diagram 
2 construct line point appropriate confusion point 
3 find intersection line appropriate axis line 
4 new chromaticity . 
best reference meyer , g.w. & greenberg , d.p. 1988 ` colour 
defective vision computer graphic display ' , ieee computer graphics 
application 8 5 . 
also need decent reference basic color science 
familiar cie xyz color model uniform chromaticity scale diagram .

color blind , bit difficult ! 
yes certainly possible . 
need chromaticity red 
green blue phosphor monitor intend display image , 
chromaticity white point . 
information measure , 
obtain manufacturer . 
post list monitor chromaticity 
couple week ago . 
procedure , pixel ! 
follow . 
lookup table might 
help . 
convert rgb cie xyz . 
simple 3 3 matrix multiplication 
monitor datum . 
b retain y component later , convert xyz chromaticity coordinate u ` v ' 
use u ' 4x x +15 y +3 z , v ' x +15 y +3 z 
c find equation line step 2 
d find intersection step 3 
e convert back u ` v ' xyz , use y value step 
f ensure new color display monitor ; , move 
along line xyz space towards neutral gray ie half way black 
white .
