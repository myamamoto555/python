- currently format know least person 
- university able get sign non-disclosure agreement . 
- map format pretty well top secret . 
would love know 
- could make 
- reverse eng . 
xilinx tool dump bit map fpga 
- run computer hardware key . 
self-modifying hardware could interesting -- 
computer could write thier program assembler , compiler 
immense breakthrough calculator could . 
- eagerly await programmable gate array use pd format 
- cost first bear program . 
till keep reverse 
- engineering whatever . 
one company work go 
- . 
fpga need make product competitive . 

- could afford . 
end could say could afford 
- use management discover late .

condolence . 
even imagine could hardware . 
imagine self-modifying software , 
even though teacher say bad , even worse goto , 
check expert use say self-modifying code : 
use `` order '' rather `` opcode '' 
`` principle large scale computing machines ''

collect

reprint absolutely permission anyone . 
`` plan ... full size 40 binary digit word hold 
either contain 
1 full size number ... equivalent 12 decimal digit , 
use first binary digit denote sign 
two 20 binary digit order . 
... 
add technique 
automatic substitution order , 
i.e. machine 's ability modify order 
control one among order 
absolutely necessary flexible code . 
thus , 
part memory use `` function table '' , 
`` look '' value function value 
variable obtain course computation 
require machine modify , 
rather make , reference memory order 
control `` look '' , machine make 
modification already calculate value 
variable question . 
hand , ability machine modify 
order one thing make code 
non-trivial operation view . ''
