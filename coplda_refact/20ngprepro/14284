`` almost '' mean differential cryptanalysis attack . 
choose 
plaintext attack require detailed analysis 2 ^ 36 choose plaintext 
draw total 2 ^ 47 need run , understand 
situation correctly . 
certainly `` break '' meaning 
act , constitute much less work brute force . 
rest article assume figure skipjack 
encryption algorithm e choose correct datum send

wish joy , choose try attack . 
defend system , fact offend idea

, quite different . 
government would percentage 
choose f weak key , since advantage 
anybody else know . 
`` expert '' could thus assume f worse 
anything else analysis . 
totally different situation 
unknown s-box . 
, say would good 
satisfactory expert give raw algorithm without 
rest surround detail regard chip protocol 
-- simply doubt give 
information .
