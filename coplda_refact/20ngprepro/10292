part study year ago university arizona 
see whether cross dominant individual particular handedness 
dominance opposite eye better hitter 
side dominance hand eye . 
pick 
softball class cross dominant right hand , leave eye 
put small minority grad student try get 
equal number cross dominant side dominant people . 

control study , use pitching machine - fast pitch . 
since 
use slow pitch , come close actually think 
foul tip hit ball . 
lot people 
like study i.e. , hit fast pitch , 
use hit machine , would seriously question 
result study !! 
think study major 
league player across fairly large cross section player test 
whether eye dominance opposite side `` better '' - 
know result . 
woman run study 
say higher incidence major 
leaguer across general population - sure 
whether would believe .
