would put stronger . 
consider nonsense . 
simply put , see way `` platonic essence '' could 
real existance . 
`` essence '' platonic sense 
referent far tell - imaginary concept 
invent provide explanation thing better explain 
way . 
, attribute ` essence ' god attribute something 
exist !! 
thus orthodox platonic formulation seem leave 
unity god limbo , since base ` essence ' , 
thus fail avoid problem suppose address . 
thus , , unity god must primary , must 
secondary , must modal aspectual relate role , mode 
interaction , since otherwise meaning say god one .
