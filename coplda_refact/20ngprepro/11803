discussion `` objective '' seem fall solipsism eg : 
recent challenge frank dwyer , someone prove actually 
observe phenomenon . 
someones even make statement science 
`` subjective '' even atom `` subjective . '' 
get bit silly 
word `` objective '' lose meaning . 
let start remember 
definition `` objective '' already present : 
objective adj. 1 . 
material object 
distinguish mental concept . 
2 . 
actual existence . 
3 . 
a. emotion personal prejudice . 
b. base 
observable phenomenon . 
objectivity thing base whether everyone agree 
thing eg : world objectively round , regardless fact 
exist flat , rather whether base observable verifiable 
phenomenon instead base solely people wish , feeling , mental 
process , etc . 
thus atom , base observable repeatable 
phenomenon , indeed consider objective rather subjective . 
even weird , high energy physics base observable phenomenon even though 
observation change outcome . 
observable phenomenon 
affect emotion , personal prejudice eg : chemical reaction 
change whim different people . 
thus say science 
objective ie : objectively verifiable bit silly , 
point science . 
agree science objectively `` good ; '' 
thereby conclude though science objective . 
example thing `` objective '' : d-12 tractor larger 
average breadbox . 
chlorophyll green . 
seawater contain salt . 
exist ozone atmosphere least presently . 
ozone block 
ultraviolet light . 
ultraviolet light increase incident skin cancer . 
`` good '' hand value judgement . 
seem 
existence apart give unless someone objectively show 
existence omnipotent entity define `` good '' . 

quantify , touch collect concrete sense eg : bag 
full `` good '' . 
sometimes attempt give word `` good '' 
objective meaning , e.g. `` good '' use denote strength , resiliency , 
speed , etc. . 
though , subjective definition , might see 
`` strength '' etc , necessarily `` good '' eg : strength inspire naziism 
generally view `` good '' . 
morality , say ever see morality strictly base 
verifiable observable phenomenon . 
closest see form 
`` golden rule , '' conclude best deliberately piss 
people , likely involve life , 
manner like . 
verifiable ; `` get someone 's face , '' 
often retaliate . 
another objective fact morality 
powerful group enforce morality weaker group , thus 
time , ignore form `` golden rule '' without fear reprisal . 

whether enforce morality `` good '' `` bad , '' quite 
subjective . 
way , remember subjective mean thing 
formally state , even commonly agree upon ; mean 
verifiable observable phenomenon , physical 
existence unto . 
also note state 
thing objective morality , could accept 
morality ; simply state see evidence 
morality . 
one thing notice , `` objective '' many time use synonymous 
`` true '' `` absolute , '' `` subjective '' sometimes connotation 
`` false '' `` relative . '' 
tai necessarily . 
instance , 
conclusion base objective , insufficient evidence , 
objective false . 
`` absolute , '' easy note 
objectively show tnt explosive , absolutely mean 
tnt explode , thus objective necessarily absolute 
either . 
hand , something subjective also either 
`` absolutist , '' `` true . '' 
instance , theist 
specifically `` absolutist '' morality , even though 
subjective evidence back . 
, many scientist detective 
motivate subjective reason eg : `` gut feeling '' `` hunch '' , 
investigate phenomenon situation , gather objective evidence 
necessary support true hypothesis . 
whole though , would 
agree objective evidence much trustworthy subjective 
evidence . 
later , 
dave butler 
start thesis , seem , one put forward one 's 
point departure something incontrovertible ; expression 
simple dignified .
