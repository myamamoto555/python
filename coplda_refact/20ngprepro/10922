conveniently ignore murder four batf agent 
branch davidians unprovoked ambush . 
government allow tinpot dictator set shop declare 
private state drift anarchy . 
law control 
ownership gun batf good reason beleive 
violate . 
set obtain legal warrant 
attempt serve meet gunfire ring 
doorbell . 
paranoid assertion batf fire first unprovoked 
assault assume batf death wish . 

expect anything citizen 
would accept search authorize court would turn 
tank break door day one . 
stupidity attempt serve place 
ludicrously underarmed unprotected police . 
anyone net care suggest sure fire method bring 
four police officer justice perhaps could 
hear .
