paul 's statement assert particular choice 
matter karmic fulfillment past , fate 
man bear blind john 9 . 
question 
simplistic idea karma machine sole determiner 
one 's destiny . 
even eastern tradition , many , 
say , one knowledgeable poster point . 
fact paul know believe reincarnation 
say anything one way another . 
even john baptist , 
jesus say emphatically elijah matt 11:14 , appear 
aware , least point ask . 

interesting threefold denial -- question whether 
christ , prophet i.e. isaiah , elijah , emphatic 
first case weak third . 
would like add , important discuss 
different passage may point directly teaching repeat 
earth life , one way another , really see important 
time subject revisit term larger view 
christianity christian doctrine . 
part , 
accept either reject central idea christianity , 
christian , hold conviction kind separate treasure . 
believe christianity important new understanding bring 
bear , vice versa , much central christianity 
take entirely new dimension meaning light repeat earth 
life . 
direct bearing many issue frequently discuss 
newsgroup particular . 
say openly develop view repeat earth life 
largely work rudolf steiner . 
hold 
authority , whole picture christianity become clearer light 
idea . 
steiner indicate old consciousness - 
nation necessarily fade away could renew later 
time , time development christ idea first 
two millenia christ 's deed golgotha . 
time , become 
important , receive basic gospel salvation , 
understanding life human grow embrace 
significance idea . 
discussion newsgroup , 
try focus relate directly possible 
scripture fundamental christian teaching tradition .
