hard time understand attitude . 
gospel least bit accurate , little 
doubt jesus belive hell reality . 
teacher , would wise loving thing people 
audience head ? 
warn ! 
would , however , 
rather cruel sadistic believe place exist 
remain quiet . 
scenario envision respect would 
justified jesus know place hell , speak 
anyway , scare people . 
unless would accuse jesus 
, would encourage reconsider loving response 
perceive someone danger .
