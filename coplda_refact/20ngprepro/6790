national security agency nsa ? 
nsa official security body u.s. government . 

give charter president truman late 40 's , 
continue research cryptology till present . 
nsa 
know largest employer mathematician world , 
also largest purchaser computer hardware 
world . 
government general always prime employer 
cryptologist . 
nsa probably possess cryptographic expertise many 
year ahead public state art , undoubtedly break 
many system use practice ; reason national 
security almost information nsa classify . 
bamford 's book give history people operation 
nsa . 
follow quote massey highlight 
difference public private research cryptography : 
`` ... one regard cryptology prerogative government , 
one accept cryptologic research conduct 
behind closed door . 
without doubt , number worker engage 
today secret research cryptology far exceed 
engage open research cryptology . 
10 
year fact widespread open research 
cryptology . 
, continue , conflict 
two research community . 
open research common 
quest knowledge depend vitality open 
exchange idea via conference presentation publication 
scholarly journal . 
government agency , charge 
responsibility break cipher nation , 
countenance publication cipher break ? 

researcher good conscience publish cipher might 
undermine effectiveness government 's ? 
one might argue publication cipher would 
force government behave like stimson 's ` gentleman ' , one 
must aware open research cryptography fraught 
political ethical consideration severity 
scientific field . 
wonder conflict 
occur government agency open researcher 
cryptology , rather conflict least 
aware mild . '' 
us export regulation ? 
nutshell , two government agency control 
export encryption software . 
one bureau export 
administration department commerce , authorize 
export administration regulations ear . 
another office 
defense trade controls dtc state department , authorize 
international traffic arm regulations itar . 
rule 
thumb , work cocom less stringent 
requirement , dtc take order nsa want see 
everything first refuse transfer jurisdiction . 
newsgroup carry many interesting 
discussion law surround cryptographic export , 
people think law , many complex issue 
go beyond scope technical group like . 
make sure 
consult lawyer anything get throw 
jail ; lucky , lawyer might know lawyer 
least hear itar . 
tempest ? 
tempest standard electromagnetic shield computer 
equipment . 
create response discovery 
information read computer radiation e.g. , crt 
quite distance little effort . 
needless say , encryption much good 
available way . 
beale ciphers , hoax ?
