raise `` expand question '' 
question list , mix feeling . 
list 
always open anyone `` : '' line 
general agreement stuff 
appropriate . 
almost subscriber 
bike , although r , rt r owner also . 
point , main interest list preserve peace 
time provide wide access 
possible . 
list fairly technical , `` ? '' 
, 
`` kind get ? '' 
kind question . 
yet 
bash , k bike bash , `` bmw mfg would 
1962 piece shit '' bash . 
post , consent 
govern , proscribe . 
simple name change would make significant difference 
, go stand way progress . 
, hesh , let turn question around : anyone 
else join list feel boxer exclude ?
