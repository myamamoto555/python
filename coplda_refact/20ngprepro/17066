without open sabermetric flame war , would like 
question notion `` sit rested player '' real 
effect long-term performance . 
sure , man tired need 
real rest , take break might constructive act . 
perhaps 
man mentally `` strain '' , sit might help 
extent help relax . 
would like suggest 
long run , player slump , benching probably irrelevant .
