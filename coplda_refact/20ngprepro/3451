first let 's assume right fewer gun would make 
country , sound great see gun inherently 
evil except every one gun would hand someone 
obviously could care less follow law , 
get gun illegally , likely commit crime gun . 
great everyone gun likely use crime , nice system . 
reduce number gun come society make 
illegal manufacture , sell , import coutry , let use 
parallel empiric evidence . 
amount cocaine country 
far less since manufacture , sale , importation . 

last statement true perhaps consider plan . 

could also apply drug general .
