, something call `` delany amendment '' make carcinogenic 
food additive illegal amount . 
pass congress 
1950 's , stuff like mass spectrometry become available , increase 
detectable level substance couple order magnitude . 
thing like cyclamate red # 2 ban . 

weakly carcinogenic huge quantity rat , act 
ban . 
also apply natural carcinogen . 
might remember 
time back 1960 's root beer suddenly stop tasting good , 
never taste good . 
time safrole ban . 
active flavor ingredient sassafras leave . 
possible market root beer good like old day , someone 
would , order make money . 
fact one indicate 
enforcement still effect . 
odd exception rule seem product know `` gumbo file ' '' . 
nothing coarsely ground dry sassafras leave . 

natural product , natural product still natural 
form , maybe evade delany . 
maybe special exemption 
make , appease powerful louisiana democrats .
