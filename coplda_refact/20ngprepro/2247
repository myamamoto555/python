catholics always call church `` holy mother church '' 
`` mother . '' 
example would st. cyprian carthage , 
write 251 ad , `` anyone god father , 
church mother ? '' 
hence image church woman , hold cross cup , 
tell lord , power 
blood grail legend , also , significantly , show 
`` cup new covenant blood , shall shed 
many . '' 
luke 22.20 , cup represent new covenant 
hold blood redemption .

catholic church catholic , universal , find throughout 
world , church show apply blood 
redemption mankind spread , thorugh
