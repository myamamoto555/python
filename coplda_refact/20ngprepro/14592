necessarily . 
body denature cook dehydrate due 
heat , projectile need minimal kinetic force penetrate . 
fire aftermath , body tend fall apart loose large chunk 
meat little effort . 
medical examiner tend like clean 
scene . 
, body suitably cook , bullet com 
magazine explosion would likely enough force enter 
thus would difficult determine whether bullet enter 
time death , much later , unless train look 
evidence .
