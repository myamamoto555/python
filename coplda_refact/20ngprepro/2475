honest , think city houston love new owner . 

bring baseball back houston key acquisition -- player 
houston area want play astros . 

think many people fearful mclane meddle team 
already admit know whole lot baseball . 
mclane businessman , like excuse . 
make valid point 
injury excuse club . 
look depth 
bench season . 
. 
play 7 position ; bass james solid 
outfielder hit well ; uribe nice well . 
. 

pitch staff 6 legitimate starter . 
deal young 
houston team , injury play big role . 
threat 
bullpen -- jonesy go , may trouble 
type starter season , less pressure pen .
