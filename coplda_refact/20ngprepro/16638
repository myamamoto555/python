jim , say . 
say good thing 
. 
police talk run gun 
buyback program , get impression really think 
impact community . 
ask 
component program , say `` well ... '' , answer 
question , , false hope intent . 
think intent 
show folk police attempt something curb interpersonal 
gun violence whether effective . 
look , measure 
impact program use sort pre-test post-test 
evaluation , point ? 
must symbolic nature . 
police 
essentially say `` look , gun lie around 
want , 'll give $ 50 ... care community '' . 
, joe could think way measure effectiveness 
ineffectiveness program could become rich famous . 

know vast majority gun use youth 
bring school youth daily basis 135,000 youth 
obtain easily quickly , personal friend , often 
`` borrow '' parent without knowledge .

greatly underestimate presence gun life youth .

400,000 bring gun school least year .
