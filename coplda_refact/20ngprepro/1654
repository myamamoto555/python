pretty clearly , alomar get huge boost home park . 
necessarily . 
could mean , could mean hit 
lot better home road see frank thomas ' 
split '91 example . 
would guess alomar 's split 
due skydome , probably due coincidence . 
way sure , course , hitter skydome 
seem regularly help lot right hand home run hitter , 
alomar home run hitter . 
> would say could make good equal right . 
t&p 
> rate baerga higher , actually . 
& p 's bogus fielding stats , rate alomar worst 
defensive second baseman league . 
career basis , think t&p 's 
field stats may mean something , seasonal basis come 
ridiculous result like . 
alomar may god fielding 
media say , sure worst baseball . 
offensively , t&p rate alomar much higher last year . 
regard v. b argument , 'll say good player 
different strength bright future .
