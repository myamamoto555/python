think kind comparison pretty useless general . 

processor good good computer design around adn 
computer use design purpose . 
compare processor speed 
pretty dumb increase clock speed 
increase speed among thing . 
mean say 040 faster 486 without 
give operational condition ? 
say 
run program use lot function . 
know 040 function build 
fpu 486 , say 040 still faster ? 
anyway , hope people decide upon wether computer 
good solely processor . 
fast processor 
base name , one alway certain thing 
processor speed . 
restrict arguement , example , pure 
processor architectural issue . 
one processor work 
well another base design , get 
somewhere discussion .

overall would figure 040 030 2.5 .
