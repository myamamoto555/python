think find active linux community 
populate enthusiast would object pay money software . 
otherwise , would probably go commercial unix . 
important factor linux community source code always 
available probably similar community , however , 
really involve . 
many people use linux like stay cutting 
bleeding edge : ie . 
kernel patch , c library compiler patch come 
, people like rebuild entire system . 
prime requirement 
linux software available gnu style public license . 
hence , linux software use either athena widget . 
individual may write software require motif , doubt widely 
adopt .
