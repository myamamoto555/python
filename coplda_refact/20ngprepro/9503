bill rights , far see , refer `` citizen '' , 
make several reference `` people '' . 
example , article iv : 
`` right people secure person , house , papers , 
effect , unreasonable search seizure , shall 
violate '' ; article v : `` person shall hold answer capital , 
otherwise infamous crime , unless presentment indictment 
grand jury ... shall person ... deprive life , liberty , 
property , without due process law '' ; article viii : `` excessive bail 
shall require , excessive fine impose , cruel unusual 
punishment inflict '' . 
never hear constitutional rights apply citizen ; 
mean apply equally person live u.s. ? 
whether slave consider `` human '' know , seem 
case could make treat `` people '' define 
bill rights . 
since nation nominally base 
declaration independence state `` man create equal , 
endow creator certain unalienable rights , 
among life , liberty , pursuit happiness '' , 
would also seem slave would follow definition 
humanity .
