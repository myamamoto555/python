nope . 
problem either cause excessive voltage drop 
long cable generator , plain enough power . 

would suspect amp go draw lot current short 
peak . 
try use larger shorter cable generator , try 
strap amp service run main cable , 
minimize line drop . 
work , though , ` re 
go need bigger generator . 
assume use well-maintained generator , watch 
voltage output generator properly . 
come 
unloaded generator 'll never get end .
