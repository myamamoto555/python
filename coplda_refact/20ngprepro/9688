belief deny anything prove exist . 
easily nail show infinite number 
conceivable observe exist , mean would 
believe ? 
accord poster , must believe 
object prove exist stop 
god ?

except trivial difference , say one miss finger , one blond 
hair , ... live planet see 
reason one atheist bring none christian 
vested interest unknown exception god .

value life much theist support .

ah , 's another point get faq . 
atheist 
hold positive view god exist , may 
non-existence positive belief . 
example : 
strong atheism - `` believe god exist '' positive belief 
weak atheism - `` believe god '' negative belief 
, one never think idea 
god whole life technically atheist , kind 
call unreasonable . 
let 's look way set 
suppose give person huge set idea represent 
capital letter people either believe idea 
exist real object . 
santa , e person 
believe santa still idea santa . 
notice 
even e another idea ! 
mean lot case : 
christian : , e yes , b , e b , ... g , e g yes ... . 
g god 
atheist strong : , e ... g , e g 
atheist weak : , ... e i.e. g set 
agnostic : , ... . 
. 
g , e g indeterminate , e ' , ... 
> people afraid say `` undecided '' ? 
must another

inspire much hate conflict . 
blasphemous . 
> political . 
fact often take mean unsophisticated . 
nietzsche say man would rather nonexistence 
darwinist way put humanity always 
prefer yes maybe indecision useful survival 
trait , evolution drill take position , even false one .
