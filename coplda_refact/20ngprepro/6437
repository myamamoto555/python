expect run time + - factor 10 
use best know algorithm find shortest path 
solution cube randomly choose position ? 
read faq follow recent discussion 
cube believe question answer . 
notice 
specifically look algorithm find 
shortest path , solution . 
seem underlie assumption program 
would need brute force search though 10 ^ 20 position . 

seem unreasonably pessimistic assumption want 
know someone significantly improve . 
idea approach problem , 
spend much time develop want know 
someone else already work . 
: post three group attempt 
set followup seem 
place continue discussion . 
cross post summary 
become appropriate . 
email reply gladly accept .
