yo ken , let 's keep thing ! 
`` external tank '' 
`` wingless orbiter '' option delete ssf redesign 
option list . 
today 's edition new york times report 
o'connor tell panel redesign proposal 
drop , use `` giant external fuel tank use 
launch space shuttle , '' build `` station around 
existing space shuttle wing tail remove . '' 
currently , three option consider , present 
advisory panel meeting yesterday report 
today 's times . 
option `` '' - low cost modular approach 
option study team msfc . 
aside , 
ssf redesign team msfc , jsc , larc support 
srt station redesign team crystal city . 

reston folk also on-site location , help respective 
team redesign activity . 
key feature 
option : 
- use `` '' , modular bus develop lockheed 
qualify st elv 's . 
bus provide propulsion , 
communications , & data management . 
lockheed develop 
air force . 
- `` power station capability '' obtain 3 shuttle flight . 
ssf solar array use provide 20 kw power . 
vehicle 
fly `` arrow mode '' optimize microgravity environment . 
mission would utilize power 
source 30 day mission . 
- human tend capability oppose old ssf sexist term 
capability achieve addition 
us common module . 
modify version exist 
ssf lab module docking port add international 
partner ' lab , take place node ssf . 

shuttle dock station 60 day mission . 
orbiter would provide crew habitability & eva capability . 
- international human tend . 
add nasda & esa module , 
add another 20 kw power 
- permanent human presence capability . 
add 3rd power module , 
u.s. habitation module , assured crew return 
vehicle . 
option `` b '' - space station freedom derived 
option `` b '' team base larc , lead mike griffin . 
option look alot like exist ssf design , 
come know love : 
option assume lightweight external tank available 
use ssf assembly flight option `` '' . 
also , 
number flight compute 51.6 inclination orbit , 
option `` '' `` b '' . 
build-up occur six phase : 
- initial research capability reach 3 flight . 
power 
transfer vehicle , 
visit . 
- capability griffin yet adopt 
language achieve 8 flight . 
u.s. lab 
deploy , 1 solar power module provide 20 kw power . 
- permanent human presence capability occur 10 flight , 
keep one orbiter on-orbit use sometimes 
would two orbiter on-orbit - , 
second one come logistics & re-supply . 
- `` two fault tolerance capability '' achieve 14 flight , 
addition 2nd power module , another thermal 
control system radiator , propulsion module . 
- 20 flight , internationals on-board . 
power , 
habitation module , add finish 
assembly 24 flight . 
system currently ssf use as-is option , 
exception datum management system , major 
change . 
option c - single core launch station . 
jsc lead option . 
basically , take 23 ft diameter 
cylinder 92 ft long , slap 3 space shuttle main engines 
backside , put nose cone top , attach 
regular shuttle external tank regular set solid rocket 
motor , launch . 
key feature : 
- complete end-to-end ground integration checkout 
- 4 tangentially mount fix solar panel 
- body mount radiator add protection 
& orbital debris 
- 2 centerline docking port one end 
- 7 berthing port 
- single pressurized volume , approximately 26,000 cubic foot 
twice volume skylab . 
- 7 floor , center passageway floor 
- 10 kw housekeeping power 
- graceful degradation failure 8 power channel , 4 thermal 
loop , dual environmental control & life support system 
- increase crew time utilization 
- 1 thru core module
