necessarily . 
think , 
provide real security , must sort key exchange , 
either use public-key encryption scheme , use key exchange scheme 
like diffie-hellman . 
out-of-band transmission share 
session key , protect band eavesdropping ? 
phone 
company online central authority generate session key 
send user , point go trouble 
complicated ? 
ask phone company 
copy session key call . 
, probably practical user keep online copy 
every public key use anyone anywhere , right ? 
, probably , 
way get key verify . 
might digitally - 
sign chip manufacturer copy public key unit , 
store unit . 
might also online directory access 
everyone 's public key . 
would introduce another weakness 
security scheme , course . 
presumably , use 
designate key , get verify connection standard chip . 
might useful modify chip , would allow 
use either original key pair , key pair 
verification scheme . 
unfortunately , would allow call 
people establish secure communication ...
