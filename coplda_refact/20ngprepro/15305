original poster , john , say might use monitor 
sparcstation lx . 
lx able generate picture 1280 1024 
76 hz . 
officially , try set resolution refresh rate 
lx come screen . 
tube obviously could 
handle speed . 
67 hz , work perfectly . 
buy third party monitor go use sparcstation 
lx , might consider monitor fast enough 1280 1024 . 
know sure whether lx support sun certainly tell 
'll check .
