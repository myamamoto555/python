look couple component catalogue 
come across range peltier effect heat pump intend cool 
component . 
hear effect , put 
current one device , pump heat one side 
. 
reverse current reverse effect . 

think temperature difference give emf well . 
anyway , strike could make nice box 
picnic one , power regulator , thermostat 
couple heat sink . 
biggest device shift 
efficiency 80-90 % , bad although would flatten 
car battery half hour . 
unfortunately catalogue list anything basic 
spec heat pump . 
imagine would get 
temperature gradient across device increase . 
, presumably 
power decrease increase , eventually 
steady state current consume assume 
leakage . 
, final temperature difference 
two side could set supply voltage nothing 
although would lousy way control . 
would like know : 
1 : guess correct ? 
2 : open-circuit thermal resistance typical device ? 
want sure go get warm 
fast unplug 
3 : peltier effect heat pump actually work ? 
look like 
magic ! 
4 : use thing domestic ? 
thanks advance , 
paul .
