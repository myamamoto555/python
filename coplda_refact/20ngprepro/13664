yeah , want start pool first person arrest 
mistakenly life turn upside-down law 
enforcement agency make chip : : person association ? 
wonder plan keep record e.g. encode 
serial number upc scan k-mart along credit 
card info , . 
least phone number tend locate house 
whatever i.e. come telephone number person 
likely house etc. , plus minus shenanigan 
course . 
would hate think guy get clipper id , record 
conversation , quick name come 
owner id mistakenly , maybe sell phone 
garage sale phone steal car whatever . 

might know one side conversation , example . 
anyone think govt forbid law 
database lose two point . 
first , law enforcement agency 
course . 
second , forbid budgeting 
money . 
irs , example , anyhow . 

spend money technically legal guess . 
instead probably trade little favor company like 
mastercard irs 'll bet lot 
opportunity trade favor major corps database . 
know , irs guy read amazing list screen , 
could hear typing pull screen phone 
dispute intimidate , actually , much 
dispute , particularly disagree , reason 
fellow want play tough guy , hope better .
