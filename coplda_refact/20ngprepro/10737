kevin kimmell - computer undergrad write : 
: 
: simple concept null modem 
: cable . 
actually idea , count last statement . 

: ask pin use specification ? 
want 
: solder one instead buy one . 
even know port 
: use . 
: 
: help please

idea info gladly accept . 
specific knowledge , recommendation 
package follow one 's instruction make null - 
modem cable . 
reason one may different since 
really standard pc pc communication . 
following tutorial 
write give understanding rs-232 null modem , 
still check software ! 
couple detail rs-232 . 
rs-232 
specification communicate computer 
modem . 
actually end system communication 
hardware . 
terminology use data terminal equipment dte data 
communications equipment dce . 
rs-232 spell voltage level , 
connector type , pinout , signal protocol . 
connector 
`` '' ibm set alternative `` standard '' . 
primary 
signal transmit data td , recieve data rd , signal ground sg . 
signal provide control dte dce . 
example , dte announce power ready participate 
communication via data terminal ready dtr signal . 
dtr 
output dte input dce . 
similarly , dce announce 
ready participate communication via data set ready dsr 
signal . 
dsr input dte output dce . 
ok 
five signal ; four interest . 
request send rts 
signal output dte input dce use 
ask dce permission send datum . 
dce agree , send ok 
via clear send ct signal . 
completeness , cts input 
dte output dce . 
two signal interest 
ring indicator rus datum carrier detect dcd . 
input 
dte output dce . 
rus would expect - 
signal dte say someone attempt establish connection 
dce . 
rather specific modem telephone line setup . 
dcd way dce announce `` connection '' establish 
i.e. local dce talk remote dce . 
- . 
oh 
many rs-232 signal define , obsolete . 

explain nine signal pc . 
pinout follow : 
name 
sg 5 7 
td 3 2 
rd 2 3 
dtr 4 20 
dsr 6 6 
dcd 1 8 
rts 7 4 
ct 8 5 
rus 9 22 
address problem hand . 
connect pc pc dte 
dte , dce pair middle therefore rs-232 
signal definition work quite right . 
dce assert 
cts , dsr , dcd , rus . 
common thing use 
signal - also forget dtr rts output well . 

simply make null modem cable pass sg , 
cross td rd i.e. pin 2 one end connect pin 3 
end , etc . 
problem solution pc want send 
datum way know pc ready . 
would 
send datum hope get . 
therefore better null modem would 
include pair cross . 
particular point confusion 
software area . 
run wire mean soft - 
ware use . 
use built-in bio control 
serial port , bio dictate wire need 
use . 
comm . 
package brooklyn bridge , lap - 
link , package dictate cabling requirement . 

thing guess reliably sg , td , rd. . 
also 
fairly common . 
one issue need address . 

flow control . 
rs-232 , dce 's responsible 
flow control assume dce could possible over-run 
dte . 
mean long dte dtr line assert , 
dce send datum - without request permission first . 
note contrast 
direction datum flow : dte must request permission 
assert rts line must wait ct signal 
send . 
dte dte , question need flow 
control ? 
usually . 
? 
communication , 
one common technique xon - implement software - 
wire dedicate flow control ; td rd carry xon 
command . 
type flow control use addition hardware 
flow control , problem send binary datum 
datum might include xon code cause erroneous 
signal . 
work around software insert extract `` escape '' 
code , hardware flow control prefered . 
problem hard - 
ware flow control standard . 
lot way 
bet try . 
one cornerstone method 
use one direction . 
beyond anything fair 
game . 
, must look comm package cabling requirement . 
bet 'll find one cable wire properly could work 
package long vintage . 
way , 
familiar one package use flow control 
rts request send dtr ready recieve , cts 
clear send dsr request recieve . 
mean 
cable - software . 
clincher cabling 
stuff common uart directly control ct 
signal mean cts must present even support - 
ing software . 
case find cable short 
rts ct end perhaps dtr ct . 

possible short might software expect certain 
signal feel like provide would 
mean additional wire . 
specifically talk dsr . 
short 
dtr dsr good idea general may find cable like 
. 
bad idea defeat whole purpose . 
one 
`` gotcha '' signal dcd . 
software include pc bio expect 
see dcd work . 
signal sometimes get short 
dtr . 
favorite null modem rts cts short end , 
rts also connect end connect dcd . 

course cross course sg must 
pass . 
null modem work software . 
flow control , 
, use . 
comm . 
package 
specify cable require pc pc connection , suggest use 
one .
