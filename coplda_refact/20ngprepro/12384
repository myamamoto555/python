gasp pant hm , sure whether 
silly remark serious remark . 
case 
misconception , think henry robertson update datum 
file korea since ... mid 1970 . 
car korea longer 
luxury . 
middle class people korea afford car 
least one car . 
problem korea , especially seoul , 
many car , well taxi 
bus , rush-hour become 24 hour phenomenon 
place park . 
last time hear , back january , kim administration 
want legislate law potential car owner provide 
parking area , like japan . 
also , henry would glad know hyundai 
car manufacturer korea . 
daewoo always manufacture car 
believe kia back business well . 
import car , 
mercury sable become quite popular well , though still 
quite expensive . 
finally , please ignore henry 's post korean politics 
bureaucracy . 
quite uninformed .
