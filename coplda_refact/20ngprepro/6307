fantasy find something fundamental importance 
one hot question day ' 77 . 
really little 
reason believe , raw hope . 
fantasy , certainly 
mean mania .

think enough contemporary find result surprising . 
would quibble . 
would like know toricelli 's 
reason experiment ; post hoc _ construct _ reason , 
thought head consider problem . 
may 
impossible know much toricelli 's thought ; bad 
. 
one 's service science go 
root pasteur 's fleming 's people 's note , 
discover surprising clue motivation . 
pasteur never 
publicly admit plan create mirror-image life , dream 
right notebook finally public many year , ready 
anyone read . 
friend often ridiculous 
reason pursue result ; one best come mad 
colleague claim disprove claim . 
course , toricelli 's case may example : 
fantasy motivate experiment , turn right 
end .
