good remember every translation extent 
interpretation , point one must really go back 
original arabic . 
regard verse relevant nature , prefer 
use dr. maurice 's translation book , `` bible , 
qur ` science '' general translation literal . 
maurice translate portion verse address 

'' ... one travel orbit motion . '' 
also note `` celestial body '' first translation quote 
translator 's interpolation -- existent 
original arabic , include bracket . 
> perhaps someone read original arabic eliminate one 
> interpretation ; rate , neither one exactly 
> impressive . 
right , verse _ _ contain remarkable . 
however , dr. surgeon , `` dr. '' think 
significant verse contain geocentric idea , even 
though geocentrism rage 17th century ? 
. 
go rest qur ` well , 750 
verse regard nature , think remember reading .
