several recent post identify english word ` easter ' 
babylonian goddess ` ishtar ' . 
` easter ' pagan word right , nothing ishtar . 
` easter ' ` ishtar ' related , history would show . 
old english , easter ` ' , cognate english ` east ' 
german ` ost ' . 
reconstruct proto-germanic form ` ' . 
1400 ` easter ' high front vowel like ` ishtar ' . 
clearly , two word quite separate origin . 
may neo-pagan worship ishtar easter , , 
make either mistake etymology , deliberate play word .
