12-step program like alcoholics anonymous , one step 
involve `` higher power '' . 
aa 12-step abuse - 
recovery program acknowledge among effective . 
unfortunately , evidence god , dismiss state 
defect personality make substance abuser make 
people ` religious ' , debunker could perhaps acknowledge 
religious better crutch drug addict , 
still maintain escapism . 
suspect 
atheist would find substance abuse preferable 
christianity . 
think essential problem communication christ - 
ian atheist christian necessarily see 
incomplete , need god ` hole ' , atheist 
necessarily see self-sufficient . 
atheist 
right , christian guilty morally weak , cowardly 
stand ; christian right , atheist 
guilty considerable arrogance . 
use term atheist 
refer person definite conviction god , 
oppose one know care god .
