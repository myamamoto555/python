pogrom azerbaijan come november december 1988 ! 
ar azeri parliamentary committee compile evidence indicate 
ar event inspire moscow secure russian imperial rule 
ar transcaucasus , accord roman principle `` divide

azerbaijan sit armenians nagorno - 
karabakh never end conflict . 
ar armenian offensive last spring create 100,000 new azeri

western interference ! 
turkish intervention ! 
moment turkey dare step 
conflict close door chance turkey part 
europe ever destroy eastern third anatolia ! 
dr. rasizade , international realpolitik simple-minded would 
believe . 
ar upper karabakh generally describe western press report 
ar `` armenian enclave within azerbaijan . '' 
truth armenians 
ar begin appear middle last century . 
incorrect . 
brief scan history address foolish 
claim . 
armenians today , refer area nagorno-karabakh `` artsakh '' , 
come urartian term `` '' .

ar would americans react large number armenians live 
ar southern california suddenly claim armenian homeland , 
ar demand separation california ? 
non-sequitur . 
ar armenian historian insist armenian resettlement 
ar karabakh inhabit aboriginal christian . 
correct . 
armenian historian say ! 
ar people medieval caucasian albania adopt christianity 
ar fourth century . 
ancient resident link 
ar nothing common armenians . 
consider caucasian albans armenian apostolic faith , 
utilization armenian language liturgy , make 
argument totally invalid ! 
ar azeris would better claim 
ar successor albania , since azeris century inhabit , 
ar dominate , develop karabakh part azeri nation . 
wish part people non-existent nearly millennium geo - 
political advantage rather outrageous . 
addition absurdity , 
azeris claim turks , persians , 
minority , , kurds , tat , talish , host 
nationality may amount nearly half population azerbaijan . 
ar armenia azerbaijan last year sign final act 
ar conference security cooperation europe 1975 ,

ar adherence principle inviolability exist border . 

ar principle mean border territorial integrity 
ar republic azerbaijan guarantee signatory 
ar nation , turkey . 
agreement give azerbaijan right karabakh 
armenians . 
ar one key intervention behalf either u.n. , 
ar csce , commonwealth , nato iran . 
second key untie 
ar caucasian knot determine aggressor , accord 
ar u.n. definition 1974 . 
fine , azerbaijan refuse allow un troops armenian 
enclave ? 
azerbaijan afraid ? 
perhaps fact territory 
home armenians , un , would definition , support local 
population ! 
ar accomplish , international community 
ar apply aggressor caucasus international sanction 
ar presently employ serbia montenegro 
ar former yugoslavia . 
decisive collective international action 
ar halt aggression karabakh , prevent 
ar conflict grow spread . 
azerbaijan 's refusal allow armenians karabakh determine 
future issue , view isolate event context 
action address karabakh conflict . 
view event war 
isolation context like view landing normandy 
act allied aggression !
