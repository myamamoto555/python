indeed , sky look much like black body look carefully 
enough ; particular , temperature radio frequency quite 
bit higher would see black body . 
morgan & gordon 's fat 
`` communications satellite handbook '' graph sky temperature vs. 
wavelength , fact , communication design . 
however , term energy content , rf frequency negligible . 
thermal purpose , large distance sun sky 
look like black body 3.5 k allen , `` astrophysical quantity '' . 
find number distance , since solar radiation 
tend something ignore , m&g say `` 4k '' 
brief discussion solar radiation dominate problem .
