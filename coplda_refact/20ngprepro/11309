oiler rationale regard renegotiation player contract 
deal deal . 
sather spout repeatedly . 

contract northlands 1999 . 
deal deal . 
perhaps 
include income receive sale asset player 
gretzky income receive expansion fee 
revenue would lose money . 
admit pull

think pocklington receive ample provincial subsidization . 
really blame go municipal subsidization 
certainly entitle . 
pocklington `` suck '' revenue 
oilers order prop fail business interest . 
pocklington trust . 
doubt much oiler 
team ever make playoff pocklington 's stewardship . 
soon player show competent nhl ` er expect 
pay accordingly ship younger player 
draft pick .
