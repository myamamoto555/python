remind old tom paxton song ... 
`` m changing name chrysler 
tom paxton , 1980 
oh price gold rise sight 
dollar sorry shape tonight 
dollar use get 
buy head 
economic forecast right 
amidst cloud spot shine ray 
glimpse new better way 
devise plan action 
work last fraction 
go action today . 
chorus : 
change name chrysler 
go washington d.c. 
tell power broker 

perfectly acceptable . 
change name chrysler 
head great receive line 
hand million grand 
'll stand hand 
yes sir 'll get mine 
creditor scream dough 
'll proud tell go 
win ' y scream holler 
'll pay last dollar 
endless stream money seam flow 
'll glad tell 
matter simple form two 
renumeration liberal education 
ai kind glad debt 
chorus 
since first first amphibian crawl slime 
struggle unrelenting climb 
hardly walk money start talk 
sad failure awful crime 
way millennium two 
seem different point view 
corporate titanic failure gigantic 
congress safety net . 
chorus ... 
perhaps steven jobs take paxton 's advice change name 
chrysler , perhaps set s&l , maybe neil bush could 
give hand ? 


eternal reward forgive waste dawn ... 

opinion express mine . 
like anyone else would 
admit .
