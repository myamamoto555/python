well , seem strike interesting discussion . 
give 
astrophysicist nuclear physicist , 'll boil 
bit . 
1 datum burst date , show smooth random distribution . 
2 mean concentrate galactic core , someone 
els . 
3 distribution smooth , either see enormously 
large phenomenon scatter edge universe say phenomenon 
subject debate almost phenomenon 

see phenomenon like oort cloud , need 
potent little energy source , detectable 
current method . 
4 know real close , like slightly extra solar , 
parallax measurement burst . 
5 burst seem bright something like black hole quantum 
super string impact something like . 
everyone watch datum argue like mad meanwhile . 
wonder , people 's opinion , new physics problem . 
einstein get well know photoelectric effect . 
copernicus , start look irregularity planetary motion . 
big enough problem , create new area physics ? 
little speculative thinking folk .
