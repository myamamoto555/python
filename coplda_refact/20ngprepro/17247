: even half-duplex mode . 
ouch ! 
thanks try . 
: question whether celp best approach application . 
produce 
: great compression expense tremendous cpu load . 
want 
: something run ordinary workstation even high-end pc 's 
: without dsp card . 
guess algorithm go 
: better starting point . 
yes . 
sure make , 
find low sample rate 3300 8 bit per sample 
plus pd ` shorten ' lossless sound compression code actually get 
speech 14.4 k leave . 
definitely worth 
work , folk .
