hear rc2 scale arbitrarily

mdc cipher use one-way hash function stream 
cipher , current implementation use md5 use key 2048 bit 
, use 1-bit key want copy entire 
range , use entire 2048 bit . 
runtime 
independant key size , system run slightly slower md5 . 
presume rc2 rc4 use similar system possibly hash 
key n bit , maybe 128 , use something like md5 .
