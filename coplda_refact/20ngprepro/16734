wrong point . 
age universe direct effect 
humanity 's sticking power , way moral system society 
. 
say universe `` real age '' , see evidence 
; cosmology , astronomy . 
say age independent 
people 's opinion , know different people lot 
different opinion matter , yet empirical test consistently seem 
give roughly result .

logically consistent empirical test contradict 
opinion . 
test opinion , test 
would opinion would contradict mine , even 
conduct say test identical manner , ? 
, take 
show test validity beyond opinion .

agree . 
hypothesis , however , change ; hold 
`` ultimate hypothesis morality '' towards change could 
gravitate , could change way imaginable , 
produce different result suitable different task purpose .

`` better '' `` worse '' almost ? 
always define context 
moral system . 
prediction _ always _ correct , within 
moral system . 
need objective definition 
`` good '' `` bad '' ; wish luck .

assume objective reality , get statement like . 
_ _ , assume `` objectively 
real '' morality ? 
besides , _ exactly _ provably wrong 
statement ?

claim objective morality suddenly positive 
claim ? 
besides , think _ _ lend credence claim ; ponder 
different individual , fully functional human member 
society , yet wildly different moral code . 
morality 
`` objective '' , least one way base , yet hir 
` incorrect ' morality seem function fine . 
come ? 
produce individual , might easiest pick 
different society ; say , islamic one polynesian 
matrilineal system , example still exist .

look . 
claim never know good means ? 
one thing `` good '' circumstance , wish 
achieve goal , reason . 
time wish something 
else , thing longer clearly `` good '' . 
thing hard make `` good '' , would seldom ever 
wish achieve sort goal mass murder would lead one . 
still , 
aztecs fine spaniards wipe . 
almost always know `` good '' means ; sometimes even know . 
never claim `` good '' thereby fix stone , immutable .
