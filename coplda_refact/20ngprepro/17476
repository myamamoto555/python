would suggest write detailed letter incident 
hospital administrator . 
specify date time . 
possible 
name technician . 
send copy clinician whose care friend 
admit . 
say , though friend argument 
doctor , find administrator sometimes ignore 
complaint patient become litigious . 
clinician may 
inform complaint surprised find 
name suit . 
response within week send follow letter . 
attach photocopy original letter . 
weekly 
get response . 
cat scan non-invasive scary . 
scanner 
bad place claustrophobic . 
interesting 
study bmj , 10 year ago , find around 10 % 
people cat scan find unpleasant would 
never another . 
compare 15 % say 
lumbar puncture .
