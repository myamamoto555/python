member liturgy committee , tell problem 
certain people dominate , want try kind 
innovation . 
priest seem even _ want _ make 
decision many case . 
guess easier `` try 
something new '' refuse allow . 
parish holy thursday , instead priest wash foot 
`` want get around people 's foot , '' accord one 
priest congregation `` invite '' come help wash one 
another 's hand . 
symbolism action distressed , refuse 
participate . 
think come 
rubric liturgical action i.e. `` body christ '' -- `` amen '' 
receive communion , could `` responsible 
blood man . '' 
also part eucharistic prayer `` bless , god 
creation ... '' substitute text read lay couple . 

priest certainly give part mass 
, disturbed decline receive communion 
night require anyway -- instead offer 
prayer priest parish . 
> wonder -- oddball , quality mass

mean facetiously . 
go mass every thursday 
> friday remind power simple liturgy make aware 
> god 's presence . 
far obligatory sunday masses ... maybe

quality mass change . 
, 
celebrated accord rubric set church , would 
still `` liturgically '' beautiful . 
problem come 
people try `` creative '' . 
think answer question participation could 
give father peter answer question pose 
title thomas day 's _ catholics sing _ . 
`` 
want '' nonsense . 
way , non-catholics reading , problem 
reflect bad liturgy catholic church , 
disobedient church change `` authority . ''
