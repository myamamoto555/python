atlantic cement co. _ , 26 n.y. 2d 219 , 257 n.e. 2d 870 1970 : 
oscar h. boomer , et al. , land near atlantic cement company 's 
plant near albany , n.y. fact pattern give information 
come first , plaintiff 's acquisition land 
defendant 's start production cement plant . 
course 
regular operation , cement plant injury 
plaintiff ' property via dirt , smoke vibration emanate 
plant . 
plaintiff seek injunctive relief -- , ask 
court order atlantic cement stop damage property . 
commentary : seem entirely reasonable . 
boomer al 
property , presumably , right quiet enjoyment . 
atlantic cement 's action deprive boomer et al right . 
instead grant plaintiff ' request injunction , court 
order accept damage property , provide 
atlantic cement pay $ 185,000 compensatory damages . 

word , court grant atlantic cement co. , private party , 
power authority _ take _ plaintiff rights quiet enjoyment 
property eminent domain . 
take eminent domain 
always problematical even state ; allow 
private firm , opinion , totally wrong . 
yes , know , _ boomer _ court call eminent domain . 

walk like eminent domain swim like eminent domain quack 
like eminent domain ... 
let take issue way present case ... say 
`` happen _ boomer _ judge allow 
plaintiff blackmail cement plant demand multi-million 
dollar plant shut $ 185,000 damages . '' 
blackmail ? 
pull black 's law dictionary , abridged 5th edition ... 
`` blackmail : unlawful demand money property threat 
bodily harm , injure property , accuse crime , expose 
disgraceful defect . 
crime commonly include 
extortion statute . '' 
define `` blackmail '' one party 's act demand right 
set sale price unique piece property 
another party express interest buy ? 

demand right sell property price ? 
see 
, boomer et al , find fortunate position 
something atlantic cement purchase want 
stay business , every right world set whatever price 
want . 
, least , law say 
nice guy private business dealings . 
go say : `` plant would never shut -- 
plaintiff 's lawyer would negotiate windfall settlement , 
plaintiff would prefer amount greater $ 
plant shut , plant would prefer amount less 
value plant plant continue operation . '' 
, ? 
since court suppose 
business prevent party reap windfall settlement 
party settlement arise wrongful act 
party ? 
atlantic cement want face choice 
pay windfall settlement go business , well , 
atlantic cement think go _ _ 
business ? 
note far fact show boomer et al _ _ 
party responsible bring situation -- 
atlantic cement 's fault choose build operate type 
plant . 
say : `` everyone 's property rights protect ; 
plaintiff make whole ; unnecessary settlement cost avoid . '' 
, dispute claim plaintiff `` make whole . '' 
, fact , court action deprive rights owner 
property choose sell sell property price 
acceptable . 
deprivation _ _ make 
whole . 
ask : since court suppose 
business ensure `` unnecessary '' settlement cost avoid ? 
, -- always think court 
suppose business ensure justice . 
> _ boomer _ really teach `` infamous ? '' 
really sad 
> , fail see less completely sensible . 
> read law economics stuff first-hand instead 
> filter teacher clearly like , whatever 
> inexplicable reason . 
1 _ boomer _ teach `` infamous , '' least 
school . 
aside : northeastern law usually good job hire 
first-year , mandatory class torts , first 
encounter _ boomer _ instructor , regardless personal 
opinion , teach law neutrally . 
student get 
second third year , student pick 
choose course take except mandatory professional 
responsibility , course b presume bit worldly 
self-confident , less likely consciously 
intimidate law school professors able learn openly 
bias instructor rather indoctrinate , instructor 
tend open express opinion . 

especially true part-time instructor , real life , 
practice attorney sit judge ... _ _ 
educational , sometimes far teach somewhat 
cloistered scholar . 
end aside . 
call infamous opinion . 
reason 
state , believe triumph something 
call `` economic correctness '' justice . 
2 `` completely sensible '' believe allege 
right owner atlantic cement stay business avoid 
lose lot money due wrongful act , 
alleged right several hundred atlantic cement employee 
job disappear , trump rights people 
property damage atlantic cement 's wrongful act . 
believe correct court 
branch government grant private party right take 
people 's property eminent domain . 
> would like posner , bill . 
libertarian . 
really ? 
know ... , anything , say 
case like _ boomer _ ? 
> course , much paper trail ever nominate 
> president , democrat like antitrust stance republican 
> like support gay marriage , bright law student 
> `` shiver '' understand , easy imagine

see mike godwin claim

> opposite . 
go . 
admit understanding field generally refer 
`` law economics '' weak . 
advocate use economical 
analysis one many `` tie-breaker '' factor court may use 
help reach decision case dispute , measure 
scale `` justice '' , evenly balanced , fine . 
illustrate 
_ boomer _ , _ _ fine court start view economics 
case important justice case .
