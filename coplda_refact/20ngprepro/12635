thanks post exact wording see 
previously . 
part quote seem indicate 
disapproval capital punishment - use 
means sufficient ; would say stronger 
restriction say capital punishment useable 
justifiable . 
would certainly say case 
crime justify death perhaps old testament 
interpretation , reverence life would say 
would oppose actual infliction death penalty new 
testament interpretation ? 
. 
matter debate whether 
death penalty work keep peace way 
non-violent provision . 
believe , 
would certainly observe usa , 
death penalty , far higher murder rate 
uk , .
