right . 
say know average , 'll give 
question shot . 
key issue buy ink dry speed . 
really 
try awful hard get ink smear . 
hp need 
10-15 seconds completely dry . 
case , however , get 
page wet . 
unlike laser printer , material page ink , 
toner . 
go without say . 
pc little memory ram , take little 
print ----- every application use take run . 

computer solely print , pur like kitten put page 
every 15-30 seconds , depend detailed graphic . 
windows soft font . 
assume deskjet , 
hp would sell many ... . 
size another factor . 
much smaller , hp build 
like tank . 
bet would get damage first . 
finally , print quality . 
love 's resolution . 
look like 
good laser quality print . 
hp 's use ... look like ink . 

impressive . 
, choose canon . 
opinion ?
