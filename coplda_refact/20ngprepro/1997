initial eff analysis clinton privacy security 
proposal 
clinton administration today make major announcement 
cryptography policy effect privacy security 
million americans . 
first part plan begin 
comprehensive inquiry major communication privacy issue 
export control effectively deny people 
easy access robust encryption well law enforcement issue 
pose new technology . 
however , eff concerned administration 
already reach conclusion one critical part inquiry , 
public comment discussion allow . 
apparently , 
administration go use leverage get telephone 
equipment vendor adopt voice encryption standard develop 
national security agency . 
so-called `` clipper chip '' 
80-bit , split key escrowed encryption scheme build 
chip manufacture military contractor . 
two separate escrow 
agent would store user ' key , require turn 
law enforcement upon presentation valid warrant . 

encryption scheme use classify , chip 
available manufacturer incorporation 
communication product . 
proposal raise number serious concern . 
first , administration appear adopt solution 
conduct inquiry . 
clipper chip may 
secure product . 
vendor developer may 
better scheme . 
furthermore , rely 
government sole source clipper chip . 
rather , 
independent chip manufacturer able produce chipset 
base open standard . 
second , algorithm trust unless test . 
yet administration propose keep chip algorithm 
classify . 
eff believe standard adopt ought public 
open . 
public confidence security 
standard open independent , expert scrutiny . 
third , use , 
system may prove reasonable balance privacy 
law enforcement need , detail scheme must explore 
publicly adopt . 
give people confidence 
safety key ? 
disclosure key third party waive 
individual 's fifth amendment rights subsequent criminal 
inquiry ? 
sum , administration show great sensitivity 
importance issue plan comprehensive inquiry 
digital privacy security . 
however , `` clipper chip '' solution 
ought consider part inquiry , adopt 
discussion even begin . 
detail proposal : 
escrow 
80-bit key divide two escrow agent , 
hold 40 bit key . 
upon presentation valid 
warrant , two escrow agent would turn key part 
law enforcement agent . 
likely attorney general 
ask identify appropriate escrow agent . 

administration suggest one non-law enforcement federal 
agency , perhaps federal reserve , one non-governmental 
organization . 
, agreement identity agent 
yet . 
key registration would manufacturer 
communication device . 
key tie device , person 
use . 
classify algorithm possibility back door 
administration claim back door mean 
government could break code without 
secure key escrow agent president 
tell back door classify algorithm . 
order 
prove , administration source interested arrange 
all-star crypto cracker team come , security 
arrangement , examine algorithm trap door . 
result 
investigation would make public . 
government market driver 
order get market move , show government 
believe security system , fed first big 
customer product . 
user include fbi , secret service , 
vp al gore , maybe even president .
