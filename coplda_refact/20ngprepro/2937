rewire still part job , however , ground may connect 
local earth ground , rather back breaker box . 
jamie say , gfci device require code number place ,

noise pickup 
long cable run sometimes enough cause frequent tripping breaker . 
device save life , decide install , sure check 
regularly use test button . 
run family business electrical supplies lighting many year , 
see many seasoned electrician fry , forget double check
