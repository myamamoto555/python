superficially good answer , simple . 
awful lot 
starvation poverty world directly cause economic 
policy western country , well diet typical 
westerner . 
instance , third-world country terrible 
malnutrition problem export soya produce -- 
feed cattle us , make tender juicy steak burger . 

get money pay interest crippling bank loan 
encourage take . 
fund-raising ethiopia truly bizarre 
idea ; instead , ought stop bleed every penny get . 
perhaps accurate say western ethic 
western infanticide . 
evidence suggest long child 
die third world , could give shit . 
go 
suppose `` pro-life '' movement , . 
could save far life 
fight third world debt fight 
abortion . 
hell , interested fetus , could save 
fight human rights china . 
besides , suzanne 's answer imply non-western country lack 
ethic infanticide . 
apart china , policy mandatory 
force abortion tibet , believe case .
