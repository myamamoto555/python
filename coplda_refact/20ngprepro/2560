perhaps reason simple -- maybe marketing people put together 
brochure price list clear fpu issue . 
afterall , apple 's literature always 100 % correct . 
funny one 
notice recently brochure macs cd 
capability refer `` auto inkjet '' feature . 
read `` auto 
inject '' feature correct brochure see 
apple . 
since correct older brochure , guess 
someone edit copy , see `` inject '' think typo 
change familiar word `` inkjet '' . 
hmmm , would ? 
printer build cd player ? 
way 
write information cd ?
