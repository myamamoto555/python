joe morgan think - 
williams 3-4-5 hitter . 
believe - 
williams fine , definitely opinion bond hit

williams still get break ball although much last season . 
, bottom line bond far disciplined productive 
hitter williams , prefer take chance bond drive 
1 , 2 3 hitter expect high obp williams . 
williams would get fastball bond first second base open
