couple point thread . 
1 . 
use process since way challenger . 
challenger 
self uncover flaw . 
2 . 
mr. spencer say large true . 
process 
dependent `` sophisticated tool '' case tool ? 
. 
however , tool 
fix bad process . 
also , tool support shuttle 
language somewhat limit . 
3 . 
onboard flight software project rate `` level 5 '' nasa team . 
group generate 20-40 verify code per year nasa . 
4 . 
feel free call organization interested info 
software development process .
