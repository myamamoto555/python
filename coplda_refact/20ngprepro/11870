maybe use wrong amendment . 
someone seize 
safe contain paper record , demand produce 
combination , applicable defense would grounds 
unreasonable search seizure . 
police would entitle 
subpoena document relate specific matter , broad search 
imply impound record would unconstitutional . 
case safe , would probably get locksmith 
assert examine document cover warrent . 
sure ! 
cryptographic case , resort would 
cryptography . 
would also make good `` mental experiment '' use 
choose escrow agent . 
would trust propose agent 
key hard disk ? 
-- half key matter .
