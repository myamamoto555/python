interesting article scientific american time ago 
breathing liquid . 
month _ abyss _ come . 
far remember , mention three thing difficult 
substitute breathing fluid : 
- low viscosity -- difficult force fluid & 
lung , extract enough oxygen power 
breathe effort let alone anything else 
- diffusion rate -- obviously , air lung 
expel breathe ; part expel 
part nearest wall alveolus . 
alveolus ? 
trip blood vessel new air 
diffusion gas fluid . 
apparently oxygen 
tend diffuse readily co2 , even get enough 
oxygen , might able get enough co2 . 
- capacity -- able dissolve enough 
gas per unit volume . 
oh , course , new breathing fluid must irritate lung 
interfere healing anything like ...
