's , problem . 
might 
problem , quick enough cover deficiency stance 
cause , lose enough bat speed stance hurt

biggest problem never find stance comfortable 
month . 
change stance much , lose 
track strike zone . 
wednesday 's night game , 
clearly mad strike call corner look pretty good 
. 
think longer know strike zone really 
change stance much . 
also bit concerned get palmer gonzalez hit 
homerun , 'll become competitive , swing even harder screw 
even worse . 
larussa always say canseco 's famous batting 
practice homer show harm good encourage 
bad hit habit .
