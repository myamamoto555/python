recall read somewhere , youth , science popularization 
book , isotope change normally affect chemistry , consumption 
heavy water would fatal , seed water heavy 
water sprout . 
anyone know ?

one else seem know , 'll post . 
topic come shortly 
flap start . 
recall , experimental mouse . 
show various ill effect eventually die . 
reason 
deuterium exactly reaction rate 
hydrogen due extra mass cause lower velocity , 
constant , mumble . 
throw various bit body biochemistry 
kilter , get sick die . 
never hear anyone way , real 
life . 
process take quite . 
anyone want write 
book , would imagine would : 
1 : replace significant fraction water body heavy 
water . 
2 : wait normal breakdown repair process cause 
molecule body synthesise use deuterium . 
process victim would gradually deteriorate 
eventually die , imagine would take week 
poisoner would ensure significant proportion 
water victim ingest heavy . 
would get mess symptom doctor would 
alarmed confused . 
every organ body suddenly 
begin deteriorate ? 
figure poisoner get 
heavy water victim hospital could real 
story . 
come think , < 2 > would continue even heavy water 
longer ingest , hospitalisation might late . 
detectable effect would victim 's body fluid 
would literally `` heavy '' . 
water molecular weight 18 
heavy water mw 20 . 
thus victim 's weight increase 
1 % every 10 % body water replace heavy water . 
maybe 
detection occur pathologist lab notice 
victim 's urine strangely dense . 
medical test 
involve specific gravity body fluid ?
