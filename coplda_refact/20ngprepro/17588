productive member society .

ok , look . 
like . 
foot bill . 
maybe 
take choice a. maybe take choice b. maybe take choice 
c. afford one . 
take choice would 
pay , say $ 5 . 
take choice b would cost $ 20 . 

take choice c cost $ 20 hell lot next 
18 year . 
one sound realistic willing pay 
? 
people happen like choice a. people happen 
like choice c pay , . 
c around pay 
year . 
even though mean spend lot money , 
conscience refuse pay . 
around perfectly 
legal , fund past . 
go fund 
people object . 
like idea tax money go 
pay choice a. could refuse fund . 

woman afford choice force take choice 
b c , cost money . 
see 
reason money spend effect remove 
personal choice woman . 
alternative fund 
mother choose . 
also still fund b even c 
mother choose . 
however , woman certainly choose , 
save $ 15 otherwise would spend . 

`` tax '' raise fund choice object , 
lower fund choice legal , despite 
objection . 
actually , tax really go go , 
sure would point . 
amount save 
area help another -- like massive debt . 
disagree give `` reason '' . 
give abortion 
legal right abortion support majority 
population ... 
... justifiable refuse abortion woman afford 
, simply require even greater fund delivery 
would force upon . 
refuse pay tax remove choice 
woman object legal medical procedure .

refuse `` make alternative affordable 
'' . 
refuse pay expensive choice birth , 
statement would make sense . 
case , . 
clinton try block funding pre-natal care delivery leave 
health-care plan , would certainly object . 
would also 
quite surprised .

humble opinion still wrong . 
even easy adoption , still 
fact pregnancy take several month . 
month young woman 
could need get education . 
like finish high school , enter 
college , finish college , get job ... thing much harder 
`` take break '' month ... thing massive 
impact future productivity . 
`` right life '' . 
fetus person . 

conversation . 
> ah . 
let 's kill mentally well . 
people 
> like , since conversation ... 
conversation `` mentally '' . 
even 
though personally may refuse conversation `` people 
like '' , still possible conversation 
. 
possible anyone conversation 
fetus .

`` biologically independent '' mean ? 
'll happy 
> punch definition full loophole . 
still biologically independent . 
least extent 
. 
consume nutrient digest normal manner . 

breathe air . 
fetus hand , get nutrient already 
digest mother . 
get oxygen mother well . 

biologically independent . 

awareness questionable . 
> aha ! 
admit questionable . 
yet willing kill , even 
> may aware . 
suggest re-think viewpoint . 
awareness part make `` member society '' . 

minimal conceivable requirement , yet many people seem think something 
without awareness could still important enough justify 
true member society . 
keep ask , still see real 
justification life non-sentient creature worth 
suffering sentient . 
read every response thread 
ask , yet , 'll see see one later . 
experience `` real world '' make personality .
