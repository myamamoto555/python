regard write , one `` adjust room dynamics 
stuff like '' ? 
ask professor question 
last week really know . 
since pink noise believe 
due surface state say , surface silicon 
lack covalent bond act `` trap '' nearby , since 
happen low frequency high frequency 
able `` trap '' electron , compensate ? 
seem 
would able compensate pink noise . 
see 
`` pink noise '' feature , however , many eq , wonder 
suppose compensate noise pink noise due 
`` man make noise '' like power line , crosstalk , coupling , etc. . 

information , would appreciate . 
hope sound 
draw . 
.
