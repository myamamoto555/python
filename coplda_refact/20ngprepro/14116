little confused difference `` weak atheism '' , 
put , agnosticism . 
agnosticism believe 
necessarily disbelieve anything , ? 
use 
agnostic definition -- weak atheism include 
necessarily believe god , guess one . 
??? 
actually hard time understanding people 
ever decide believe . 
constantly state 
self-examination , would appear many well include 
atheist , course -- would assume ! 
. 
guess 
people really consider important think 
answer `` life , universe everything '' -- comment ? 

wonder ...

odd thing , 
though , point start believe something , 
get sort ridiculous .
