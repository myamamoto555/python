new rule change great ! 
however , think rule 
much complicated . 
normal average fan able count 
many foul player ? 
would even remember 
name player , order determine draw foul ! 
, 
course , new `` '' , like power center 
sit slot blue , course puck come near , 
`` shooting defenseman '' `` point defenseman '' . 
finally , ` ll 
able keep stats best worst taker . 
since almost everyone ice get foul , 'll able 
see ulf sp ? 
tie domi miss penalty shot like crazy .
