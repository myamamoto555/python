appear phillies pitcher bunning short 
really overuse , least four-man rotation standard 
day , well along 10-game losing streak , 
time mauch probably desperate win cost 
phillies substantial lead evaporate . 
way use 
time may make problem worse , although bunning one 
sharpest game year final day 10-0 shutout 
red cost red share pennant . 
bunning pitch 
complete game , strike five walk one . 

would see , though , total inning 
year bunning short stack rest league . 
also notice phillies play every day least september 1 
october 1 ; play substantially game 
team , team couple day 
stretch .
