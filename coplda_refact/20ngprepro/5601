lower cost make rapid progress . 
mind -- 
hope convince -- erupt new rally cry 
generation space -- faster , cheaper , better . 
faster , cheaper , better represent passing

new 
thing sure -- also relearning old thing 
past master . 
roll baby two week ago , call 
expert tell violate law physics -- make

giant program office build space hardware . 
violate 
`` fact '' take 20 year build something new .

less many billion dollar . 
take last generation 's expert teach 
lesson . 
von braun 's first rocket

solicit bunch requirement -- would change
