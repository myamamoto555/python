datum ever read bar , course , 
eventually get turn 44.1 khz , 16 bit , two channel datum . 
oversampling take two discrete datum point , interpolate n-1 point 
n time . 
ask , people say 
interpolation simply linear interpolation , significantly 
complicate .

would guess cd maker use kind method . 
anybody

typical old unit 
fir , implement dedicated hardware addition circuit . 
kind 
speed slow , digital standard adder much less 
expensive analog component comparable precision . 
glean information hardware manual 
old cd player design ; one would find similar info 
particular cd digital filter interesting component , 
point view , idea . 
digital filter 
kind interpolation scheme read book numerical 
analysis , see broad term ` interpolation ' ... ,
