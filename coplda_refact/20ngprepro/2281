, assume ten commandment jesus ' word 
:14 -19 actually stand something ? 
perhaps `` strong 
faith ? '' 

, believe paul overrule god . 
however paul 
write largely gentile audience . 
law regard jews 
time binding jews , gentile . 

rule bind human so-called 
law , quite minimal . 
issue church 
face jesus ' death gentiles want 
follow christ . 
decision impose law say 
law abolish . 
simply acknowledge fact 
apply gentiles . 
thus contradiction mat 5 . 
far tell , paul jewish christian 
continue participate jewish worship sabbath . 
thus 
continue obey law . 
issue gentile 
christian , cover law least 
ceremonial aspect . 
jesus deal mostly jews . 
think reasonably assume 
mat 5 direct jewish audience . 
interact 
gentile time e.g. centurion whose slave heal 
couple . 
term use describe centurion see luke 
7 suggest `` '' , i.e. gentile follow 
god , adopt whole jewish law . 
commend 
jewish elder worthy person , jesus accept . 
seem indicate jesus accept prevail view 
gentiles need accept law . 
however involve want compare jesus paul 
law . 
order get full picture role law , 
come grip paul 's apparent rejection law , 
relate jesus ' commendation law . 
least 
read paul , say law serve purpose 
certain sense supercede . 
, issue one 
abolition law . 
middle discussion , paul note 
might understand way , assure 
intend say . 
rather , see law primarily 
present convict people sinfulness . 
ultimately 
impossible standard , one supercede christ . 
paul 's comment world 's clearest , everyone 
agree reading . 
interesting thing notice 
even radical position entail abolition law . 
still remain uncompromising standard , iota 
dot may remove . 
purpose convict sin , 
important relax . 
however christian , 
end -- ultimately live faith , law . 
theoretical category use rather different , 
end think jesus paul come rather similar conclusion . 

quote passage mat 5 take context rest 
sermon mount , jesus show interpret 
law . 
`` iota dot '' would suggest rather literal reading , 
fact jesus ' approach . 
jesus ' interpretation 
emphasize intent law , stay away ceremonial 
detail . 
indeed well know take rather free attitude 
towards sabbath kosher law . 
scholar claim mat 
5:17 -20 need take context 1st cent . 
jewish 
discussion . 
jesus accuse opponent care give 
tenth even minor herb , neglect thing 
really matter : justice , mercy faith , care cup 
plate clean , fact inside people 
use full extortion rapacity . 
mat -25 , 
discussion later mat 5 , suggest jesus specific 
view law mind , talk maintain 
law full strength , think aspect . 
paul 's conclusion similar . 
talk law 
supercede , specific example give involve 
`` ceremonial law '' , circumcision sabbath . 
quite 
concerned maintain moral standard . 
net result paul talk law 
supercede , jesus talk law maintain , believe 
talk different aspect law . 
paul 
embroil argument circumcision . 
natural letter 
respond specific situation , look aspect 
law currently cause trouble : law specifically jewish 
ceremony . 
certainly intend abolish divine standard 
conduct . 
hand , jesus commend law , seem 
talk law broadest implication moral 
human relationship , deemphasize aspect later 
give paul much trouble . 
unfortunate people use term different way , 
familiar current conflict . 
look 
way term like `` family value '' take special meaning 
current context . 
imagine poor historian future try 
figure `` family value '' use code word 
opposition homosexuality one specific period u.s. 
think law take similar role argument paul 
involve . 
paul clearly reject jewish value 
go along term `` law '' , people concern 
`` family value '' movement really oppose family 
value .
