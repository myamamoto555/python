another one rescue bit bucket ... 
year furor book discuss a.a. 
elsewhere net . 
generally , discussion come 
contention one hand tsv contain blood libel 
islam merit , death , least ban probably 
sort punishment ; rushdie , particularly 
non-muslim western country , every right write 
publish whatever choose , regardless whether muslim find 
offensive , without fear persecution death . 
naturally incline latter position , find 
interesting position , think fine book , 
incidentally concern islam , moreover damned 
find anything malevolently offensive . 
year , make point , various primarily muslim 
poster respond , say yes indeed read book 
call thing `` filth lie '' , `` would rank 
rushdie 's book hitler 's mein kempf worse '' , . 
unfortunately , comment usually generality , attempt 
follow request explanation specifically 
offensive meet either stony silence , generalization , 
inaccurate out-of-context reference book lead 
believe actually read . 
correction 
attempt discuss text context ignore . 
anyway , since seem one follow particular line 
discussion , wonder many rest readership 
read book ? 
thought ?
