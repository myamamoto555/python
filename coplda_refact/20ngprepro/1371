earlier article , explain many people find arrogant 
christian christian profess absolute 
belief doctrine . 
, many christian insist 
make mistake discover belief , amount say 
infallible . 
claim infallible pretty arrogant , 
probably agree . 
short , problem matter good source , 
part doctrine belief rest thinking reasoning , 
doctrine suspect . 
long brain involve , 
possibility error . 
summarise problem write `` 
way loop . '' 
someone call ` ' claim way loop , 
bother explain , prefer instead paraphrase 
sartre , ramble wittgenstein , say conclusion argument 
lead relativism . 
explain , reject argument false 
dislike lead : fact change 
dislike . 
` ' write : 
> disagree dr nancy 's sweetie 's conclusion 
> take fruition lead relativism lead . 
however , first-year philosophy student explain , ` ' 
write constitute refutation . 
say 
like write -- nothing dispute . 

two sentence ` 's post seem relevant 
point hand : 
> thing true truth real , 
> experienced verifiable . 
dispute truth verify experience . 

, example , direct experience add number . 
claim 
infallible -- fact remember sum incorrectly -- 
claim direct experience reasoning number . 
however , go past experience thing start reasoning 
, much shakier ground . 
point earlier 
article . 
human brain infested sin , trust 
limited circumstance . 
> god 's revelation absolute 
> thing . 
far get ? 
god 's revelation stop , 
reasoning begin , possibility error appear . 
example , let 's suppose modern bible translation include 
perfect rendering jesus word last supper , jesus say , 
exactly , `` body . '' 
'll presume say totally without error absolutely 
true . 
certain ? 
much . 
moment stop speaking , people start interpret , 
possibility error appear . 
mean literally ? 

record elaborate word . 
thinking 
tran - con - ? 
say . 
interpret passage 
use brain ; think reason draw conclusion . 
know 
brain perfect : thinking often lead wrong . 

something direct experience . 
8 - 
anyone believe reasoning -- know 
fallible -- lead perfect conclusion ? 
, give assumption example , certain 
jesus say `` body . '' 
beyond , start make 
doctrine use brain reason christ reveal , 
get trouble . 
unless infallible , thing certain 
. 
extent doctrine rely fallible human thinking , 
certain . 
problem seem arrogant . 
non-christian around know 
human make mistake , surely know . 

believe infallible , . 
christian speak believe reasoning never lead 
astray -- implicitly claim infallible -- non - 
christian around rarely believe implicit claim . 
witness 
hardly go work person talk believe 
either foolish recognize limit , intentionally try 
cover . 
think would far better say thing certain 
thing `` confident '' . 
example , might say 
know sin , recognize sin something directly experience . 

thing , whether base reasoning scripture extra-biblical 
think , infallible : say 
confident , ready explain reasoning . 
, far aware , none infallible -- speaking act 
thinking flawless ridiculous . 

` ' suggest people read _ silent _ , 
francis schaeffer . 
think highly , think 
mr schaeffer grossly overrate many evangelical christian . 
somebody 
else might like , though , let opinion stop read . 
someone interested opinion , would suggest _ certainty _ , 
ludwig wittgenstein . 
darren f provine 
`` substantial number reader read 
wittgenstein , 60 % posting would disappear . 
understand 
wittgenstein , 98 % would disappear .
