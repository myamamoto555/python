good advice . 
couple year involve low-speed 
land back pavement . 
head helmeted 
hit pavement `` clunk '' , leave couple ding chip 
paint point impact , visible damage . 
call 
helmet manufacturer inquire damage . 
say way 
fiberglass shell work first give , , crack . 
way fiberglass serve spread force impact 
wider area . 
fiberglass thing , crushable foam 
liner take care absorb hopefully remain impact force . 
tell second stage fiberglass functionality delamination 
layer occur visible sign , either inside 
outside helmet . 
suggest send helmet 
would inspect include . 
. 
send back helmet 
letter state could find damage would 
compromise ability helmet provide maximum protection . 
suspect letter would eliminate able claim 
prior damage helmet event sue . 
bottom line , though , appear helmet integrity 
compromise visible sign . 
way know sure 
send back inspect . 
note helmet 
manufacturer provide inspection service . 
another point 
consider purchase lid .
