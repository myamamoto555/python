thanks advance . 
yeah . 
sound typical . 
windows make sort extra demand hardware , 
therefore machine keep thing . 
ever notice 
acess floppy windows , everything else slow crawl ? 

imagine backup else run fight cpu time , 
sometimes backup program lose . 
glad . 
even run 
medium speed cp backup machine , supposedly 
machine place extra demand datum bus .
