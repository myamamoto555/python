yeah , also true long complicated sequence event , 
calculation , big computer program general . 
argue 
get similar maybe useful result fractal , 
question whether > < . 
fractal fiend seem say part system 
model replace random number generator . 

useful , instance , make datum palatable human 
perception torture test rest system , 
think much fractal , certainly would rather 
model improve explicable manner . 
guess see fractal model 
explain correlate universe actually exist . 

really hope , hold self-similar breath . 
> one thing fractal good : fractal

uh huh . 
'll believe see . 
chase fractal 
compression year , still believe . 

great , come see compete jpeg ? 
'cause , 
'll wager . 
actually , wager , quit try make fractal compression 
work - try - think reasonable 
alternative technique . 
neat , though . 
: - 
'll reiterate disbelief everything fractal . 

think fractal compression widely explain 
practical . 
know barnsley sloan trick 
sleeve make demo work , see anyone use 
real product . 
six year since iterated systems form , 
right ? 
`` always go question product 
, '' sloan reply . 
company plan ship first 
encode device summer , say . 
march , iterated 
systems half system : decoder .
