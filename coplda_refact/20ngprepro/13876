perhaps different understanding `` physics '' . 

measure anything objectively , answer get physics 
objective either .

apply science ; even theoretical physics get apply model real 
world situation , base real world observation .

axiom invariant . 
two measure , ` ll 
get different answer . 
yes , call experimental error , 
really `` error '' conventional sense ; fact , get ,

open way statement like `` murder objectively wrong 
people , within 1 % total population . ''
