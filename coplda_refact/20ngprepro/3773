year ago 
know anything implement graphic , come across demo 
apple library actually lot . 
however , quite 
limit sense low-level 3d library ; code still 
plot individual point , draw line , etc ad nauseum . 
nothing 
gl , example , handle object . 
thing consider talk apple 's old 3d library : 
; never plan exist future 
; unless call header file documentation ... 
one know something graphic , could probably figure , 
would assume better software available give better 
output , time , programmatically nicer i.e. easier 
program .
