think would least ahead ron santo .

small advantage fielding ability come nowhere near 
make large difference hit . 
average 
season , use combine average 656 ab + bb per 162 game :

robinson 17.72 152 350 35 15 
even robinson 's extra 3 putout , 2 assist , 5 dp take mean 
responsible 10 field , make 
extra 28 make plate , mention fewer 
total basis . 
difference op decrease 
account wrigley , difference still considerable . 
thorn & palmer rating

santo 123 284 -14 137 41.7 
robinson 105 52 -5 151 19.8 26.3 
usual disclaimer t&p 's fr apply , really 
way mark comparison . 
least better fielding 
percentage : carney lansford , 10th best all-time , fr , 
dead last time . 
also , since total rating compare player 
league average instead replacement level , robinson 
award extra 6.5 play 653 game . 
great 
career , would prefer santo 's plus 4 year replacement level . 
would knock traynor list replace stan hack . 
similar story , hack 's far better hit outweigh traynor 's 
superior fielding . 
graig nettles buddy bell would also better 
choice course , though recent net discussion support 
point view .
