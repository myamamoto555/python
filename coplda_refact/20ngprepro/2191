`` , '' mean leader ld church ? 
grant 
joseph smith still alive , plenty `` accusation '' file , 
little bearing reality , evidence various verdict . 
study ld history 15 year , yet see prove 
ld leadership involve , quote : `` illegal activity . '' 
plural marriage , yes , charge `` underage '' wife sound like 
could originate tabloid , discredit high moral 
standard characterize leader family , unlike , 
appear , david koresh . 
# joseph smith start sect .

murder nauvoo , il . 
jail cell , church membership split 
follow . 
initially , smith consider prophet like 
, rather interesting parallel consider muslims consider 
prophet jews , lead understand . 
make 
mistake , messiah talk smith . 

neither claim . 
church reflect moral 
aptitude leader especially joseph smith , 
nothing highest respect inspired man , whose `` crime '' 
refuse deny see vision ... many try 
explain `` smith phenomenon '' away , bold presence 8.5 
million member strong church stand witness joseph smith 's 
testimony enough resilience power carry message . 
time gift prophecy hand 
father son . 
joseph smith die , son 
teens . 
brigham young claim 
bequeath gift leadership prior death . 

twelve , church govern body , much help 
, basic conflict still wedge sect . 
young take follower salt lake . 
rest wait 
smith jr. grow enough assume leadership . 

leadership soon ignore , like mike dukakis . 
; - 
`` rest '' apostate excommunicate member church , 
great majority membership , twelve , various 
auxiliary organization , choose accept brigham young new 
prophet leader church . 
know ld scripture 
doctrine , would know brigham young first 
line fill prophet joseph smith 's vacancy : senior 
apostle quorum , various comment make joseph indicate 
brigham would lead latter-day exodus west . 
rightful `` heir '' either dead hyrum smith excommunicate 
oliver cowdery , persecution abound intensify , 
joseph smith already give order look new place , empty 
land beyond boundary united states time . 

`` '' principle well understand 
great majority ld faithful , question . 
grant , couple `` '' stay behind , unwilling 
sacrifice undertake perilous journey unknown , 
also necessary separate tare wheat . 

church benefit purification process : become even 
unified willing carry mission world . 
# sect practice `` 1-year food stockpile '' doctrine , 
frontier farming country carry 
weapon . 
little evidence 
sect , give tend move rather 
large-scale opposition . 
brigham young , suffer 
deal get salt lake , seem quite 
make military training good thing . 
remember , 
far beyond even us army go , people 
nobody turn save .

# little context put perspective . 
btw , since church jesus christ latter-day saints one 
largest denomination country `` sect '' ??? 
`` splinter '' 
religion , say , southern baptists methodists .
