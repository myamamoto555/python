, . 
`` x window system '' , `` x11 '' , `` x '' 
number designation accept x consortium . 
fact , 
`` man x '' pretty much x11 machine tell : 
x consortium request follow name use 
refer software : 
x 
x window system 
x version 11 
x window system , version 11 
x11 
thing `` x windows '' `` x window '' , despite repeat 
misuse form trade rag . 
probably tell something 
much trust trade rag -- even get name 
window system right , one trust anything else 
say ? 
regard dialup x11 implementation , several . 

buy serial x11 terminal couple company , include 
ncd . 
fact , compose ncd run x11 
serial line across 14.4 connection . 
ncd also sell software-only package provide 
ncd 's implementation serial x11 pc 's . 
may 
software package available . 
suppose include standardized compression scheme run 
x11 low-speed connection . 
call low bandwidth x lbx , 
base improve version technique use ncd 's . 
seem likely lbx release consortium standard , 
several vendor willing supply implementation various 
sort hardware .
