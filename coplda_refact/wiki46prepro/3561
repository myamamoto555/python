dr. jacob professor chemical engineering material university california , santa barbara ucsb . 
dr. receive ph.d. physics university cambridge 1972 , join ucsb 1986 . 
research involve study molecular interfacial force . 
work applicable wide range industrial fundamental science problem . 
particular , contribute significantly understanding colloidal dispersion , biological system , polymer engineering application . 
currently , study interfacial phenomenon , physics thin film , fundamental question rheology tribology surface . 
dr. develop numerous technique static dynamic measurement material molecular property vapor , liquid , surface . 
particular , pioneer sensitive interfacial technique know surface force apparatus sfa . 
instrument involve carefully approach two surface usually immerse solvent , water , measure force attraction repulsion . 
use piezoelectric positional movement optical interferometry position sense , instrument resolve distance within 0.1 nanometer , force 10 n level . 
technique similar measure force interaction atomic force microscope afm sample surface , except specialize sfa measure much longer-range force intend interaction measurement oppose measurement . 
result sfa experiment use characterize nature intermolecular potential molecular property . 
dr. also well-known author textbook \ `` intermolecular surface force , \ '' publish academic press . 
authoritative book describe fundamental concept equation applicable intermolecular interfacial science discipline .
