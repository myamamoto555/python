A	Okay . Oh , that's not gonna work .
A	Oh , alright .
A	Okay .
A	Okay . Um alright .
D	Uh , uh , um .
A	I'll just put that there . Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . Uh I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um .
A	Go ahead .
D	Okay .I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did .
A	'Kay .
C	Hiya , I'm Ryan . Um I'm the User Interface Designer . Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . And the detailed design umsort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special .
C	That's about it .
B	Right .I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . In the functional design phase I'mI'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . And uh the detailed designin the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay .
C	Yeah .
A	Okay .
A	Um so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . Um so we are putting together a new remote control . Um we want it to be something original . Um of course we're anot only a electronics company but a
A	fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use .
A	Um
A	we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um .
A	And 
A	w uhwell um functional design um .
A	Um do we haveum
A	any ideas of omaybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and
A	and how we're gonna do the detailing on it .
C	Yeah . Well uh s function of remote control is just justyou know , change channels is its main function .
A	So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote orI I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ?
C	Oh right . I suppose you c try make it a universal remote forcould work on all sort of electrical
A	'Kay .
C	products in in one person's house . But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming .
D	Mm .
A	Mm-hmm . 'Kay .
C	I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta likeI don't actually know .But is it just infra-red ? Is that standard ?
B	Mm .
A	I I thinkyeah , yeah , r universal remote . Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , sI think we're all in the same boat here .
C	Ye yeah .
D	Huh .
D	Ours too .
A	Um
C	Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em .
A	Okay .
D	Mm .
C	So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature .
D	Ch 
A	So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh
D	Like a tracking device ?
A	like a tracking device or or like a a
C	Oh you can get those keywell you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep .
A	It makes a noise , there's a button on the T_V_ that you press and
B	Mm , mm .
D	Mm .
C	Yeah .
B	Right .
A	'Kay .
D	Be good .
B	So
C	Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance .
A	Yeah . Do we wantso they're kinda like long and rectangular . Do we want something crazy ? You know , we want something new that's gonna stand out . A m a modernso our remote should be
C	Just long .
C	Yeah . Black usually .
C	Yeah .
D	Lot more modern .
C	I think so .
C	Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball .
D	Maybe like user-friendly , like a little
C	Yeah .
D	you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing .
C	PeopleI thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one anotherif it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something .
B	Mm .
A	'Kay .
D	Mm .
A	Um .
B	Well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always thesome restrictions we have to apply here . Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . What are we gonna build that thing out of ? How sturdy is it gonna be ? Do we want it to last longer or rather have people
C	Yeah .
D	Mm .
B	whatever , have to buy one every half a year ?
A	Okay soyeah , so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , then it
C	Yeah .
C	Yeah .
C	It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside .
A	'Kay . Um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy ,
A	um
A	So our form and our function . Um we want it to be um
A	easy to find .
A	Um
A	What else
A	itwhat else do we want it to to do ? So we want it to be universal .
A	It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um
A	and 
A	you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so .
D	Mm .
D	Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal .
A	'Kay .
D	That's more on the research end , butthe marketing .
A	So marketing , you know , howmaybe uh
A	marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealingremote control out there .
D	Yeah .
D	And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting .
A	'Kay .
C	Ye 
C	Small .
B	Right .
A	Um
A	Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . Some ideas ?
A	We want it to be a b a ball , you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located .
C	I'dI could draw sorta the ball idea .
C	My original idea was just simply
C	sort of a sphere , where maybe you
C	this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle
C	Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If thatif we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have
C	just sorta you you you know , your buttons .
C	Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible .
C	Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . Just somethingmaybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of
C	like light or something or lights around it . It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair .But yeah .
D	Futuristic .
C	That was that was a sorta simple idea I had and then you know you couldabout
A	Uh-huh .
C	Right , it would almost be like a ball . So that was just just an idea I had . I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ?
B	Right . One problem you'd get with this design is umthe ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part . That's one of the big issues . Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem .
C	Yeah .
C	Yeah .
C	Maybe f yeah .
C	Yeah , that's g that's a good idea .
C	Yeah . The ideait didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , that was just one idea though .
B	That's that'sinteresting of course , but that's of course a weak point , yeah .
C	Yeah .
A	How would we go about um
A	making you knowgetting rid of our weak points ? WhatI mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ?Not to put you on the spot , but
B	E No no , uh uh.
B	N n
A	What did you say your title was again ?
B	Uh , I'm your Industrial Designer , so i b well , the point is
A	You're the the Industrial Designer .
B	that 
B	well maybeI dunno . The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so .
A	Okay .
C	Well I I suppose that things becomedesign . But I mean i
D	Mm-hmm .
C	I was trying to think of like the design of others . I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah .
A	Yeah .
A	It's not new , it's not innovative , it'syou know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , it's it's stable um .
C	Yeah .
D	'Kay , I'll draw something .What ?My idea was just to have it be kind of like a
A	So ino , go ahead .
D	keyboard type shape , you know , like video games l so . But maybeI mean that would be kinda big and bulky . We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . I don't know .
C	Yeah .
D	That's my idea .
C	I think definitely doing something different
D	Yeah .
C	is a good idea .
B	Mm .
C	I mean maybe design something , that's sort of likeuh I suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier .
A	Something with a grip .
D	Mm . Yeah .
C	Yeah , with a grip .
A	Yeah . Because evenI suppose even with the ball
C	It still might be hard toit still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah .
A	it'sit might not be the easiest to hold onto um .
B	Mm .
A	So perhaps the the joystickthe the keyboard idea might work better . But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we
C	Likeyeah .
D	True .
C	Yeah .
C	It's d yeah . I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job .
D	Mm .
A	I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here . Uhum
D	That's fine . You're the boss , you'reallowed to .
B	Well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . So if the remote is too small itif it's small it probably looks better , but
D	Yeah .
A	Yeah .
B	may not be th as functional .
B	So for that there's
A	Okay , so unfortunately we've got about five minutes hereto come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um .
B	So
A	Let's see here .
A	What if we had what if we had not only umsay we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . So
A	you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way . Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part .
C	Yeah .
A	So the grip is
A	No , that wouldn't work either um .
A	But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the
A	sorta grips on the side here I guess ,
A	um 
A	and then
A	flat uh
A	And then we have the problem with the hinge .
A	So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want .
B	The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?
A	Mm , that's true .
B	It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . So it'sdon't make it too stableuh .
A	So we don't have it flip open .
A	We just have a ball
C	But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then .
B	To the other design .
A	Okay , so then we forget the ball .It looks cool , but it's really notit's not functional um . So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . What if we flipped it around here , so that it were um
B	It looks cool .
D	Looks cool though . Yeah .
B	Uhfunctional .
A	Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what youhad there . Um so it's up and down , you hold it this way .
A	Course then it's it's like the rectangularagain , only with a couple of jutting out points .But it's one-handed um .
C	Yeah .
B	Right . Right .
B	Question is what makes those game pads functional ? W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , right , makes it nice , so that's the essential part . Except for that I think we'll notprobably not get a get away from some longer design .
A	Yeah .
D	Mm .
A	Yeah .
D	Right .
B	'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing .
A	Yeah , because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do .
B	You know , all that dif batteriesright , and
B	Batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh
B	towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? So , have to m
B	show which is the front , which is the back .
A	Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ?
A	So that either way you're pointing it it would work .
B	I suppose you could do that . O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so .
A	More expensive andyeah .
B	Course you can do that .
A	'Kay .
A	Um
B	I mean of course it'll be evident after a while orif you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and thethe buttons and stuff , but um it's rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . Otherwise the design ofor the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work .
A	True .
C	Put it
C	Even if you designed itin somein a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it .
D	Yeah .
A	'Kay .
D	Sorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish . Yeah .
C	Um
A	Are we out of time ? Okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some
B	Mm .
A	Are good ideas , what are not .
C	Does it saywhat does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think .
B	Let's . Obviously
A	Uh .
A	Must finish now , so . And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want .
C	T 
D	Mm .
B	Alright .
D	Great .
A	Okay . And Project Manager will design a better meeting for nexttime around , be a little bit more prepared . And uh alright , good meeting .
