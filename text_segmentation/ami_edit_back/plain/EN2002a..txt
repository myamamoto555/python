D	Funky sh stuff like that .
A	Wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings .Yeah .
C	Yeah , exactly , yeah yeah yeah .
D	Yeah .Yeah .Look at all this stuff man .Okay .Right .
B	Okay .
B	So what do we need to talk about ?
C	Should we
D	Has anybody
C	Well should we just go around and everyone says what they d what they've been doing , how far they've gotWell I hope so .
D	Has anybody done anything ?
A	Not a lot .No .
A	Hmm . Okay . Sounds like you've done some stuff . S
B	Yeah .
D	You better start .
C	Okay . Well I've got a browser now , whichWhoops . Already gone .
B	Uh
B	Yeah .
A	'Kay .
B	Good start . Oh , I don't mind as well .This wasn't a good start .
C	Mm-hmm .
C	Yeah .
D	Good at this .
B	Okay . Sorry . Yeah .
C	Okay .
C	So yeah . We've go a browser we've umwhich comes up automatically with a transcription box and the topics . And then when you go on the menu , you can select a summarisation box , which pops up , and an audio player .
D	Right .
C	Um and a s I think the search works as well , so you could pop up a search . And it loads up um just the background window is empty and um so when you start , you have to either open open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that .
C	Does that make sense ?
C	Um the transcription box has got a summarise but button , which doesn't do anything yet . Um now I wonder wh how we wanna do , you know , we want a pop-up window with the speaker characterisation .
C	Um either we could do thatyou know , when does the pop-up come ? Either we canwhen you click on the the I_D_ , any sort of I_D_ in the transcription box , or we can put an extra buttonextra few buttons next to the summarise button so that youactually in the transcription box , but so like you click on a button and then that opens whatever that speaker characterisation is . The problem is the r the left-click is already used because it highlights that um
D	D yeah .
A	Hmm .
C	that part of speech or whatever thatwhat he's been saying , you know , the the left-click highlights it . So that you canI don't know what happens when you double-click actually , but that'd be a bit annoying if you have left-click for one thing and double-click for something else . Um I thinkso yeah , when you left-click it , you can for example set set the marker there so that the mmthe audio goes from there , I think .
D	The l the left-click or the right-click .
B	Yeah .
D	Right .
B	Can you use double-click or
B	Yeah , I don't know .
C	Um so we can't put it on left-click . We could put it on a right-click . We could for example have a little menu that pops up .
D	Yeah , it might be quite good , I suppose . Yeah .
C	So right-click on at menu , you know , and you can click on speaker characterisation , up pops the window .
D	What else could we have in the menu ?
C	That's a good point . I don't know . Nothing else .
D	Okay .So otherwise you just have a right-click or do you have hav
A	Hmm . Everything . Yeah . Hmm .
B	Yeah .
C	Yeah , yeah , but um I don't know about you , but uh usually in Windows right-click doesn't do anything , does it ? It opens a menu . Yeah , soyeah . So but that'd beyeah . If you justyeah .
D	Is a window .
D	A menu , yeah yeah . Yeah , it's why. And so it might be a bit weird the fir to just start bringing up stuff and then it
B	And then
A	Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . To just have the sort of mainsame sort of idiom throughout kinda . So
C	Yeah .
D	Yeah .
A	Hmm .
C	Um or just , you know , or just the button .
A	Yeah .
B	I guess a button button makes a bit more sense , 'cause otherwise you don't really know that , oh , what if I right-click now , what happens then ? It's like more if it's visual . Yeah .
C	Well no no , you still have the menuthe menu pop up that
A	Hmm .
D	Yeah . Yeah . It's more
C	Welloh , yeah . It's more obvious , isn't it , w what you can do . Yeah . Yeah , that's right . That's true , yeah , it's more intuitive really , isn't it ?
B	Do you see my
D	It's more idiot proof , isn't it . It's got a button 
B	Yeah .
A	Yeah . Yeah . But then it's not as extensible . Like if we wanna add more things in the future , then we have towell , new buttons .I don't know . Whereas a menu type thing is more flexible that way . BuWe're probably not gonna be adding too many things .
B	But well , we we can have both , but whatever .
C	Maybe , maybe .
D	Add more buttons .
D	Yeah . Well in uhI guess in iIn meeting browser one point one , you can have a menu instead of a buttthis why I don't think iYeah .
A	Okay , exactly . I know , I knowTrue , true .Yes .
C	In the beta version . Um but actually what we could do is onin that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the all the meetings that that user has been in .
A	Hmm .
C	Like a search for that user . Is that gonna be useful or too much ? Or
D	Yep .
D	I guess so . So what did youpart of the m the menu that comes down , it says give me all your meetings or something .
C	Yeah , so y when you right-click on it , one one option will be give me all your meetings , characterise the speaker
D	Yep .
C	Or is that too much I mean ?
B	Yeah , um I don'tI mean it w it's more like part of the
D	I guess so . It's an idea . Get to use my pen .
B	browsing sort of thingy . More thanthe speaker characterisation , as m Steve mentioned . Um , I don't really know how to involve the speaker characterisation into the browsing .
C	Yeah . Yeah , that's true , yeah . Yeah .
A	Hmm . Yeah .
C	Yeah , that's true . It'd nice to have it inconnec interconnected lik
A	Actually 
A	Yeah , but maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well . I mean speaker characterisation tied intoI don't know . Di Just some way to sort of leverage that information . Like we have it , we're doing it , but whathow does it help the browsing ? Or what can it give us in the browsing ? Yeah . Yeah .
C	Or you mean the the speaker characterisation ? Oh well , yeah , I mean ,
C	I don't know about that . I mean it'sthe speaker characterisation is a bit like you said . I mean it's like a nice thing . We don'twe're not actually sure what the user wants with it , but it's interesting , so why not give it to him .
A	Hmm .
D	Yeah yeah .
A	Right .
B	Yeah , well
C	I I think we should do it . I mean
B	Yeah . I mean I guess maybe we could have that as another thing oflike , well if you get the speaker characterisation that someone s talks a lot in uh a certain topic , and then if you , I don't know , click on that topic , you get everything that's in that topic or whatever . And in that waybut I don't know .
C	Yeah , I mean that's that's still another level further . I mean we're not even there yet . You know , it doesn't evendoesn't even pop up the speaker characterisation yet . Y we have to first define what what happens when you click on a user .
B	No no no . Yeah .
D	Oh yeah .
D	We have to have a speaker characterisation first before we cross any of the other bridges .So yeah , there you go .
C	Yeah . Yes . So should we try try to do a right-click when you then
A	Yeah .True , yeah .
D	Yeah . Alright . Why not .
B	Yeah .
A	Is that just from the main main window ? Is that is that from any particular window , like if we wanna sorta getlike if we were on the users versus like topic or something , have a right-click fromfor these various things toyeah .
C	Sorry ?
D	Even if only one thing comes up .
C	Yeah . Yes . Wait . Yeah , there's a second thing about the topics , the topic window . We wanna somehow clickbe able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that . Yeah ? So we could do that in a similar way , do it right-click as well . And to have a different menu for our
A	Right , yeah . Yep .
B	Yeah .
D	Okay . Soand so this lot is for um
A	Okay , yeah .
A	Now it's consistent throughout . So , yeah .
C	Yeah .
D	On the t speaker .
C	Soyeah . So we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by either um searching and opening individual observations . And whenthen we have the interlinking by right-click basically .
D	And then this lot is on th
A	Right .
A	Actuallyyeah , like umanother common thing , like if we have it so it's set up that um if you double-click and it goes to a default thing on the menu , I mean that's kind of a typical kinda action that would happen . If you double-click on a particular topic or something , then it goes to sort of a like a default view , so it'll be like all the um cases of that topic , eitherwhatever we decide the default to be , whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting , and just show up the the particular instances of that topic in a meeting . Like I'm just thinking to have the default there , so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that that's the most common thing that's gonna happen , so the double-click will do that and so save them the trouble of right-clicking and choosing the item on the menu .
C	Double-click
C	Oh .
C	Hmm .
C	Yeah .
C	I don't see there's anything obvious that wasthat would be able , you know , that would be
B	Yeah .
A	Well , it might come to usas we start playing with it .
B	Yeah .
D	What was that ? I didn't quite understand . Do you mean
A	Um like we have the the right-click menu . You'll have the menu , right-click it , but instead of likehave a default double-click , so if there's a de so it'll be a choice from the menu butyeah , exactly . Yeah .
B	Uh just let th
D	Yeah .
D	Oh , soand it figures out what's the most common use to double-click . Oh . Okay .
B	Yep .
B	Yeah .
B	Like , I don't know , show the speaker characterisation for instance . Or justI don't know .
A	Yeah .
C	Yeah , but then then there's the problem with a lot of windows popping up again . And they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is , you know what I mean ?
D	Yeah .
A	Hmm .
A	Yeah . Yeah .
B	But if you do double-click on something , don't you expect something to happen then ?
A	Hmm .
C	Yeah , maybe . Mm . Hmm .
B	Sort ofwell ,I don't know .
D	Sometimes you do it by accident though . You, oh go away .Stop coming up .Yeah .No .Yeah , yeah , oh yeahT throw stuffthrowing out the window .
B	Yeah .
C	Especially if you have a touch-pad .It just goes oh .Well I'll I'll check what it does on on um double-click at the moment . 'Cause I think it might do something . But but yeah , mmbut I don't I don'tI d really don't see anything obvious that that would
A	Yeah , exactly . Well then they close it . Yeah .You know , it's not it's not the end of the world .
A	Yeah ,.Yeah .
B	Yeah . Yeah , uh that wasgood start .
A	Okay .
D	Yep .
C	I mean if you can think of something that
A	.
B	I don't know .
C	Sorry .
B	I guess it depends on the
B	Yeah , what you're clicking on .Obviously .
C	Sorry . Um yeah , another thing . Single audio files . Do we wanna use them or not ?
A	Hmm .
D	We don't know yet do we , I don't think . Do you mean the single channel ?
C	Yeah , single channelthat's single channel files . Do we want them ? I mean
B	Single channel .
A	Mm .
D	Probably not , but we might need them for disfluencies , if we try do it in audio . But at the moment , no . Butyeah .
B	No .
C	Yeah , okay , yeah , yeah . I mean we might use them while wo to work with them , but do we wanna integrate them inso that when you browse you canhere's
A	Well , yeah .
D	We might want to be able to say oh , just give me what that person's saying .
C	Do you though ? I mean it's not gonna make much sense if you don't listen to it on its own d do you ? Does it ?
B	No .
D	Unless um you can't hear it properly or something . Somebody's talking over somebody else or something . Well p
D	W we just say no for now and put it in later or something . Yeah , yeah .
C	No , hmm . Yeah .
C	Yeah .
D	Yeah , 'cause otherwise it willtheit will increase the amount of data we need by a lot , won't it ? Therefore print will be bigger .
C	Yeah .
A	Mm-hmm .
C	Um
C	Yeah , wh what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that he's mentioned ? Do you think do you think it's really that bad ?
A	I think we probably need that , though to have the f the full flexibility , we need to have that there , but umyeah .
C	That's what I feel as well . I mean I'm I'm very muchI w I wanna have everything customisable . Um
A	Mm-hmm .
A	Although the thing is typically though , is someone gonna have five windows open at the same time , probably not . Probably just two or two or three of whatever whatever they're looking at , like dialogue acts , to whatever , characterisations .
C	Probably not , no . Yeah . Two or three maybe , butyeah . Butyeah , it depends , I mean I I really wanna put the summary in somewhere , you know . And the summary for example is typical . You open the window , you read through it , you might click onyou know , close it again straight-away . But it'd be good to have it there .
A	Hmm .
D	Yeah . No , I think it's I think it's fine . Yeah . I think what we're doing is fine .
A	Yeah , true .
B	Yeah .
B	But uh well , couldn't weI mean you probablyI don't know if you wanna have like the the full transcription and the summary at the same time .
B	So maybe you can just like choose the s same window for transcription and summary .
A	Hmm .
A	So like have a tab there ? For something like that choose on choose one.
C	I was just thinking of tab .
B	Yeah . Yeah .Tabs are nice . I like tabs . Yeah .
D	Yeah , tabs are good . Mozilla style . Yeah .
A	Yeah .
C	That true . Yea yeah yeah yeah .That's right . I'm not sureyeah .
B	I don't know how easy it is . BuI dunno , but
D	Does anybody know how to do that ? Or can you do that in Java ? I don't think Java knows how to do that really .Maybeyeah , you probably can . But but
C	No . I don't know . Do you reckon ? I'm sure . I'm sure you could do anything .
A	Oh you should be able to .Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
B	Yeah .
B	Yeah .
D	If you really knew what you're doing . But I don't know . It's a bit of a cripple with Java's windowing tool-kit . The eight issometimesit's a bit of a cripple .
C	Hmm .
B	Yeah .
C	I can have a look .
D	Yeah .
B	Yeah . Or just , I don't know . Yeah , uh change the contents of the same window , like from transcription to summary .
C	But yeah , that that might be an idea , yeah .
D	Yeah yeah .
D	Yeah .
B	Probably yeah .
B	Hmm .
A	Yeah , or even just have buttons on it , toggle buttons or something on the tool-bar for that window .
C	Hmm .
A	Just something .
B	Yeah , yeah . That could probably
A	A lot of different ways we can do it , it doesn't doesn't have to be a tab or whatever . Just gonna beyeah . Yeah .
B	No , no , it could be like transcription summary , like two buttons and you just press on which ever you want .
A	Yeah .Exactly .
D	Yeah .
A	Or check-marks . Even have two of 'em checked andsendYeah . Yeah .
D	Yeah , that will reduce the number of um windows we needed , wouldn't it ? Which is quite good . 'Cause otherwise Photoshop has a lot of windows , if you ever use Photoshop it's got loads , and you're always g forever going no , get out of the way . There's always stuff in the way , isn't there . So
B	Yeah .
A	Yeah . Yeah , exactly . Yeah .
B	Yeah . I don't like pop-ups .
C	But I mean people get used to it , I meanwhen you use a Windows or Linux for that matter , you have a lot of windows open . And you manage them .
D	Yeah .
D	You do , yeah ? Yeah .
A	Mm-hmm .
A	Yeah .
A	True .
D	Yeah . Unless , can youI don't suppose you can minimise them and stuff like thaCan you can you do that ? Okay , well it's alright then . Yeah . Of course you can actually , yeah , it's got everything .
B	I guess thatyeah .
C	Yeah , you can minimise 'em . Yeah , yeah .
A	Oh yeah ? Okay .
A	Yeah . Yeah , like a lot of these can be , like once we get the disfluencies out , then we canyou know , have transcript without the disfluency , transcript with the disfluentdisfluency . Have all these , you know , have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot ofand probably mutually um whate distinct , yeah . Exclusive , yeah .
B	Yeah .
C	Yeah , that's true , they're they're definitely
C	Yeah , they're definitely gonna be in the same window , yeah .
B	He's close .
C	Exclusive . Yeah , that that was the plan for the disfluencies anyway . So d
A	Yeah .
C	Yeah , do you wanna do that with summaries in ? Put the summaries in in the same window .
C	Mutually exclusive with
B	Yeah , um well could uhI don't know . Would transcripts uh b sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then . Like full meeting , meeting without disfluencies , and summarise .
A	Hmm .
A	Right .
C	Summary . Yeah , you wanna do that ? Yeah .
A	Yeah , that kinda makes sense .
B	Yeah .
D	Yeah , sounds good .
B	Um yeah .
C	And finally the prototype he spoke about . What kind of prototype could we produce ?
A	By the end of February .
C	Because I'm I'm just , you know , I go into the lab and I say right , what am I gonna change today . You know ? And it kind of justit just develops , I'm not aiming for anything . Do we wanna aim for something ?
A	Okay , right .
D	Um
C	I'm I'm pretty much getting there anyway , to be honest . It's not it's not gonna be a lot more work .
A	Yeah .
B	I guess it is . I mean just to try it andI mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so eas yeah . Yeah .
A	Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah .
D	Yeah , that's what we need , yeah . Something just slightly more than just that on its own . Yep .
C	Oh .
C	Hmm .
A	Yeah , so we can plug it in and
B	Yeah . Yeah . Just sosee the integration works sort of between the different compo
C	Mm true .
D	Yep , definitely .
B	Um
A	Hmm .
B	So I guess that's what we need to aim for .
D	I think that's kindaas well , isn't it really ? Seeing it seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be
B	Yeah .
C	Oh right , I see . Hmm .
A	Mm-hmm .
D	a prototype with a GUI .
B	Yeah . Well ifI guessI mean that was probably our intention , but we might not have written it down . SoI guessI know .
D	Yeah , yeah .Yeah .
A	Hmm .
B	Yeah .
A	Actually is the code accessible , like the the GUI stuff that you've done , yeah . Like can we just like copy like the latest stuff out of your directory , somewhere ? OrLike if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something , try and just plug some stuffI think you can if
C	Um probably not . I don't know , can you access other people's
D	You can make itif you make it world readable , then anybody can access it .
A	Well , if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable , then we c know the directory to get in then and just
D	Yeah .
C	Yeah , sure . I don't know if it's readable at the moment , but you can sure have a d have a look .
A	That might be might be an idea .
A	Yeah . I think by default they areI thinkreally ? Or
D	No , uh i i itno , they're not world-readable . It notthe defaultthey're only defaultthen only you can read them by default . You can see them but you can't read them .
B	Yeah .
B	Alright .
A	Yeah . Okay .
C	Alright .
C	'Kay . Right , well I'll make that readable then . Um so the directory is my number
A	Okay , alright .
A	Okay .
D	Yeah .
A	Or you could just email to us . Okay , yeah , yeah , okay , right . Yeah , right , okay .
C	Well , this is not difficult .It's in all the emails .NotO_ four . O_ four , five five five ,
D	What's your number ?
A	Okay .
A	Yeah .Yes .
D	Okay , your number .
D	Okay .
C	six O_ .
B	Say that again , O_ four .
C	O_ four five five five six O_ .
D	And then it's
C	And then um there's a folder um N_L_S_S_D_ ,
D	N_L_S_S_D_ .
C	and it's called the M_ browser .
D	The M_ browser , for meeting .
C	Yes , M_ for meeting .
A	Lower case .
D	Hope you hope you never have to look in my directory . It's just pure chaoS Mine is serious chaos .Files everywhere .
A	Yeah .
C	Really .No , I'm I'm extremely organised , you see . I've got folders for everything . I love folders .
B	Oh yeah .
B	Mm .
A	Hmm .
C	Yep , so that's me done . Someone else wanna talk about their stuff ?
B	Okay .
D	Don't all jump at once .
B	I could tell you what I done in S_P_ two .
D	Yeah .
A	Right .
B	Oh um I don't know . I basi I s started like browsing a bit , just like trying to see if there's anything out thereto use s sort of um just
C	Mm-hmm .
C	W what where you doing again ?
A	Um all the searching stuff . Like the the in inverted file stuff and um the next search query and all that . Hmm .
B	yeah , searching , yeahwell yeah .We're doing the. Yeah , yeah . Soit just found a tutorial buti inverted search in indexing , but I haven't read it yet . But
D	Yeah , what was on it .
C	The search , okay .
C	Okay .
A	Yeah . So you could probably just use that code , like that was behind the question she asked him earlier .JusYou know , the re-using code and stuff was just like okay , good .
C	Indexing .
B	Yeah .Yeah .
C	Oh .
C	Oh right . Oh that's pretty much there , is it ?
B	Yeah .
D	Oh you found some code for it . For the inde
B	Yeah , well I don't know if it's usable . I uh can have a look th at it . But but I found some code for likefrom a tutorial about i indexing . Uh whatever . Yeah .
A	Um apparently
A	Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
D	Alright .
C	Of making
D	Alright . Cool , cool . So even if it doesn't work , you can jiggery pokery around and make it work . Y yeah .
C	Oh great .
A	Yeah .
A	Yeah , probably . We'll probably still have to do some other file manage while , I don't know , creation . Messing around still , though . Yeah .
B	Yeah , yeah .
D	Yeah yeah . All sorts of nonsense . But yeah . By the basics is uhoh okay , that's good .
B	Yeah .
B	Yeah .
A	Yeah .
C	Yeah , that's handy .
A	Yeah . Um
B	Um yeah , I guess that's it .
C	So you think it shouldn't be too difficult ?
B	I don't know . Uh I'mI was a bit worried about whenwell when hetalked about this with the mm filemessing around with files . I mean uh how much do we actually need to do . Like extracting things from the X_M_L_ files and stuff to be able to do the indexing ?
A	Hmm .
C	Oh , I see . Yeah . You have to convert it to some sort of format , I suppose .
D	Yeah .
A	Yeah .
D	I've been trying to g write something to read the X_M_L_ and get rid of it . And I can get rid of it , but I'm having trouble putting it anywhere else . So it will come up on the screeFor the moment I haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in Java to play with it . But I guess it's not very difficult . Yeah , in Java , yeah .
A	Huh ? Okay .Right .
B	Okay .
B	Okay . Whatare you writing in Java oryeah , okay . Yeah .
A	Okay .
A	Right .
D	Yeah .
B	you know a bunch about file things .
C	I mean you should look atlookhave a look at the the browser code then , because um , you know , they already extract for example transcripts . Put it into a window at least .
D	Yeah yeah , I'm sure they do . Yeah .
A	Yeah , it's good idea .
D	Yeah .Oh yeah , I will . I'm sure it's nothing difficult . I'm sure I'm making a meal of iat the moment actually
B	Um yeah , I guess I mean it was a good point you had that like collaborating with the file things . I mean if you already started on on doing your stuff , I guess we can
A	Yeah .
D	Yeah , yeah . Absolutely , yeah .
D	Should share as much as possible .
B	Yeah .
A	Mm-hmm , libraries .
D	Yea
B	Yeah . Should we , I don't know ,
A	Hmm .
B	meet up and see what we could do ? I mean , I don't know , see what you've done and see what we need when we know more ofwhat we need maybe ?Or what do we need . Yeah .Yea.
D	Yep .
A	Right .Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , exactly , exactly . So you're still working ? I see .
D	Next week sometime , yeah .I actually haven't done anything this week 'cause this week's been manic . Buwell , whatever it was , last week then . The the the week as itas is rather than the proper week , do you know what I mean . Do you know that , it's been all a bit manic , the last m the lastyeah .
B	Yep . Yeah .
A	Yes , exactly , same. Yeah , I mean betwe um I sup yeah . Yeah .
C	What do you mean ? This week's only two days old .
B	Wel
C	Oh
A	Right .
A	Well well you're in S_P_N_L_P_ and S_P_ two , right ? So yeah . Yeah , that's where I'm at .
D	Yeah , that's right , yeah . And then we had to do an I_R_P_ , whatever it was last week as well . Which is only a page long , but it's quite difficult to write a page .
B	Yep .
A	Hmm .
A	Yeah . Yeah , oh yeah .
C	Yeah . Oh that's complete rubbish anyway .Never mind .Just so stupid .
D	More diffi it was , it wasn't marked , but it wasI had to sit there and think about it for a bit , which is a bit irritating . Yeah , but S_P_N_L_P_ .Yeah 
A	Yeah , that's fun .
B	Oh .
A	Oh yeah .
A	Okay . So . Yeah , I was thinking that we can probably get uhstart attacking this seriously and then just um , yeah , hopefully have something by next week that we can sorta try integrating into the GUI . Okay . Think that should be possible .
B	Um
B	Yeah , we're gonna meet up .
D	Yep .
C	Mm-hmm .
B	Yeah .
C	Well yethe browser as I use it now or as uh , you know , it was there when I took ium uses the um the N_X_T_ search to get the data out of the out the files , which I think is odd , but I'm not quite sure how it works yet . I don't quite understand it .
B	'Cause it's now
A	Okay . Why ?
D	So when it when it
C	To get the data i for example to get the summarisation data , you have to search for I think the I_D_s or something . Yeah .
D	That's pretty bizarre , isn't it ? Well I guess that's how it works . They've got d
C	Yeah .
D	That is pretty bizarre .
C	So they don't , you know , they don't say look in that and that folder , but they say search everything .
D	Yeah , yeah .
D	That is pretty bizarre.
A	Hmm . Well they did say it wasn't the most efficient .Very clearly , yeah .Yeah .
B	Okay .
C	Oh it does load up quite quickly . So you know , it's not too bad . But you know , you could have a look at them .
B	Okay . But itwhat whatis it like a window where you have to wr write the search query ? Or is it just what's behind it ? Soor how does it work then ? D Okay .
C	No , this is not the actual search . This is just when you open whatyou know , to load the transcript for example , to find the transcript for a certain meeting , it does does an N_X_T_ search for the string , I don't know , transcript or text or whatever .
B	Yeah .
B	Yeah .
D	Wh 
B	Okay .
D	Four , and it w it li it just has an open variable transparent s list , whatever , find everything that's got that and then load
C	Yeah .
C	Yeah , so I don't know if you've looked at the search query s language , but it's like a dollar A_ text say .
D	Yeah .Yeah , yeah , 'cause that's the uh thdeclares a variable , doesn't it , and then they keeOkay .
B	Yeah .
A	Yeah .
C	Yeah . And thenyeah . Because every every ofall of these um
C	these files have got um tha an I_D_ . And all the transcript files have got the string , I don't know what it is , words or text or something in it , so it just searches for those files .
B	Okay .
D	Right .
C	Vaguely .
B	When youlike youis there a open thingy Like well what did you two do tolike how did you figure out that this uses N_X_T_ search likeis it
C	So
C	Open .
C	Um um well , it's in the code . Just that it , you know , ityeah , you define a search object , and then you search on that string . I had to figure out how to how to do the same thing for the summary . That's how I
B	Okay .
B	Okay .
C	I had to I had to understand how to do the transcripthow they did the transcript to do the summary myself .
D	Ohsee , obvious
D	So did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it , is that what you did ?
C	Yeah , just search for a specific string .
D	Right .
C	So you could just , you know , you could use that when youif you wanna um take the data out and put it somewhere . Yeah .
D	Okeydoke .
D	Fish the data , I was just thinking that , yeah .
B	Yeah .
C	If you have a a question about w what the p the code means or where to find the code that you wanna , you know , whatever you wanna do , then just send me an email .
B	Mm-hmm .
D	Mm .
C	I can explain it .
B	Yeah .
D	Have you annotated your code nicely ? Not yet .
A	Okay .
C	Oh yeah .Actually , in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the the um the browser that I used from this fromyou know , that they gave us , had a lot of extra stuff in , and I haven't dared throwing outto through out all the functions I haven'tyou know , that I don't need . Yeah , just in case .Exactly . Yes .So they're all in there ye still . A lot of rubbish , but they will be getwill be chucked out right at the end , I think .
D	Just in casmission critical .Yeah .
A	Hmm , right , right .
D	Commen commenting it out one bit at a time and running it , does it work , yeah .Okay , get rid of that , next .Good fun , aye .
C	Yes .Exactly , yes . Yeah .Precisely .
A	Yeah . M yeah . Yeah .
B	Oh yeah .
B	Yeah .
B	Oh no .
A	Hmm .
B	Yeah .
D	So basically we go and go and do some work really , I think that's the um the umthe answer to that , isn't it . The long and the short of it .
A	Yeah , seriously , on the weekend .
C	The weekend ? The weekend's still four days off .
A	Yeah . Well f
A	UUYeah . Yeah . How many hours is this ?Hmm .
D	Yeah . ProbI'm still at the bottom of the mountain .
C	Oh .
D	Yeah .
C	I don't actually have that much to do at the moment .
D	Well , should you find you want to explore any otheperhapsyou as your umuh quantify raising .
B	Yeah .
C	WelOh dear . Well
A	Yeah , seriously .
A	Hmm . Yeah . Yeah . That's what I gotta work on .
C	I can't remember what I'm supposed to do , by the way . Am I supposed to do thesummarisation thingibob ?
A	Mm .
B	Mm . I don't know .
C	No .
A	Who was doing that ?
A	Oh really ?
C	You do .Well , I'll do that then .
B	Oh .Oh .
D	You saw it , yeah .
A	Damn .
A	Yeah , yeah .
A	These can be changed as well .Okay , yeah .Um I don't know , it doesn't matter . If if you want to . I mean it's just , you know , play around with some extra stuff . You have some time , why not .
C	Shall I do that then ? I mean
C	Or you know
C	It shouldn't be to difficult . I mean
B	Yeah .
D	So what courses should I pick to be not doing any work at the moment ?
B	Yeah .That's nice .
C	Well I'm doing communications , whichwe had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago . And that's in in two weeks .
A	Hmm .
A	Was that in informatics course ? OrOh . Oh , it likedigital, okay . Okay .
C	Yeah , it's a nine nine course as well or ten or something . Yeah .
D	Yeah .
D	Oh , so it'suh , yeah .
C	And then then I'm doing parallel programming languages and systems , which we had one exercise as well , and that's in like Friday .
A	Yeah .
A	Hmm .
C	Well I'm not doing any background reading , so you know .Being lazy .
A	Alright .Yeah .
B	Sorry . I'm just beingyeah . Hmm .
A	Fine . Hmm .
D	Yeah , me too .
A	Yeah . I'll be happy when this week is over .
B	Have wethese courses that we'reokay . Yeah .
C	Oh .
A	Yeah .Well I don't know , is that about it then or anything else we need to discuss ?
B	No .
B	I don
A	Did we wanna meet before we talk to Steve next week .
A	Well , I dunno . We'll probably get some work done over the weekend , so I dunno if after D_N_L_G_ or something , maybe just have a littlequick little update and just
B	Yeah .
C	Yeah , if you like . We can always decide then , I meanyeah . Yeah . Um so what what are you planning to do over the weekend then ?
B	Yeah , I don't know. .
A	Yeah . Well we can decide . Yeah , exactly . True . Yeah .
B	Yeah .
A	Search . Anwell sure , why not . Couldn't be that hard .Well ,it'll be , you know , still limited version of , you know , the next query search . But , no no . Won't be the whole thing then . Um like we can just decide sort of things that we do wanna do . Hmm . yeah . Well , actually most are just dialogue acts . And what else was there .
C	You're gonna do the search . You're gonna implement the search . Everything ?
B	Yeah .
B	Yeah .
B	No .
C	Mm-hmm .
A	.
A	summary topi
B	Mm .
A	Yeah .
C	It's just that I think we need to set ourselves some milestones , because otherwise
B	I don't know .
A	Yeah .
C	You know
A	Yeah , it'll get behind schedule , yeah , pretty quick . Like you're saying , yeah . Well actually , do we wanna set a date for interim prototype ?
C	Weeks will go by and
A	Specifically a date ?
B	Mine was
C	Well you decide , I'm not doing much for that prototype . So
D	Um .
B	The progress report is due on twenty third February . February .
C	Of
C	Oh .
D	So so what's that , two weeks basically .
B	Um yeah .
C	Well , how about we get it done by then ? I mean
D	Ish yeah .
C	Then we can write about it in the in the interim report , and s you know , and then we've got something to show .
B	Yeah .
D	Yeah . Okay 
B	Yeah .
B	Just looking at my own deadlines .See . Yeah , that would be fine .
C	Umoh and the the search interface .
C	Maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for . And then if you want , you can give that to me and I'll I'll build a u nice , you know , a few tick-boxes and drop-down menus .
A	Yeah .
B	Wasn't like what you had now , wasn't that pretty much what we agreed on ? Or was it justlike that one .
C	No .
C	Oh that's that'sthat doesn't exist .Tha that's completely cut and pasted .That does not exist .Nicely done though , isn't it ?It's actually all these all these um things are are nicked from umyou know , all these drop-down menus and tick-boxes are nicked from Google online .A screen-shot of Google .
A	Okay .
B	Okay .
B	This is illusion or whatever .
A	Is it semblance of reality . Yeah .
D	Yeah , that'sit's quite impressive actually . Yeah .
A	I see .
B	Oh mm .
D	That's quite slow really .Yeah .
C	It's just so much fun .It's gonna be a little difficultmore difficult . Yeah , I mean I was going to , but you know , the whole drop-down menus and stuff , what we wanna search for is not quite agreed on . We never agreed on what we wanna be able to search for .
B	Nice thought .I'm impressed .Maybe you should make it exist then .
D	No , it's not , is it ? Yeah .
A	Right , true . Mm decide on that onover the weekend .
C	So
C	Yeah , do you wanna , you know , just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do , and then then we could discuss it next meeting which options we really wanna include ?
A	Yeah .
B	Yeah .
A	Right .
C	That would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do .
A	Yeah , totally .
B	Yeah .
B	It would be nice to , I don't know , meet up and uh you can sort ofshow us a bit what you know already , so we don't sort of have to do all the work again of just like figuring out stuff .
A	Oh , just like the basic . So likeno . Sorry ?
C	Know
C	Know already what ?
B	Just like accessing the corpus and stuff .
C	Oh .
A	Yeah . Just like all theand seeing the code , and just sort of howjust see the basics of what you've done . Like just get a a quick look over and justthe basics . Yeah . Or like like , you know , the class paths all that sort of thing . Like just just say okay , well here'you know , everything's basic in set-up and then justyeah , just jump right in .
D	Can take us for a tutorial sometime .
C	Yeah .
B	Yeah .
C	Yeah . Yeah , I can do that .
B	Yeah .
C	Show you what bits the code
A	Yeah .
A	Yeah . That's cool .Yeah .In the morning .
D	Next week sometime .
C	Yeah .
C	Ah , yeah .Well this time I'm dictating the time , 'cause Iif I'm not there you can't do anything .
A	Yeah .Yeah .Yeah , I know . Well thing is , you know , ifyeah , something like that could happen anytime 'cause uhyeah , like my schedule's like a class , break , class , break , class , you know , that sort of thing . So so yeah , I know , exactly , exactly , that's what I'm thinking . So something like that and then if I have a class I can run off and do whatever . Yeah . Okay .
C	Yeah , ah it's not gonna take an hour to explain it , you know .
B	Yeah , yeah yeah .
C	I mean
B	Yeah .
C	Pick a time . I Iyou know , let me know , whenever .
B	Um yeah .
A	Actually Monday , Monday might be good d um .
B	Yeah .
C	WhatMonday . What did you say ?
A	Yeah , yeah .
B	Nextyeah , this Monday . Just
A	Anytime um , not at n not at noon or two or four .No , in between those isyou know , like one or three or
D	Mm Monday afternoon .
D	U
C	Three o'clock . Actually th yeah .
A	Sure .
D	Three is alright . It waswhat time's D_N_L_G_ ? Four , isn't it ?
A	Possibly .
B	Yeah .
B	It's full , yeah .
C	Unless you wanna do it after the um after D_
A	Yeah .
A	Yeah , that's an option too . Yeah , after.
C	D_ and A_ .
A	Sure . That's fine .
D	Three's good though . I'llbut we have s whatever . What's youwhat would you prefer ?
B	Yeah .
A	Yeah . Or three thirty .No , justyeah . That'd be necessarily necessarily short .
B	Well , it doesn't matter for me . I mean three three or afterwhat ?
C	That's gonna be tight .
D	We couldthree thirty in the in the computer room in here , and then we can just go stra if you can'tcan you get in the front door ? Oh , you haven't got a key , do you ? Can none of you get in there ?
A	Actually we can't get in there though .
B	Maybe we ca
A	W wewell we can get in through the through the the card the card door . Yeah .
C	Yeah , itwhat front door ?
D	The k the f there's computer rooms in here , the M_S_C_ computer lab anduh is in here . Well if you find me , I'll show you whereI'll I'll let us all in there , and we can all go in there .Yeah , yeah . You do need to have a key for it . Like that's the thing . It's got a lock door button .
B	In four Buccleuch .
C	I've not found that yet .
A	How about if we take uh a tour ?Yeah , right . Yeah , yeah , exactly .
B	We can go lookwe can look at now , afterwards .Yeah .
A	Okay . Just sort bang on it . Actually I was asking Steve about that , whether we can get in there . Whether he was gonna get us access into the
B	Okay .
D	Yeah , somebody will answer it .
B	Into what ? Okay uh .
A	the computer room .
D	Yeah , it's only gotit's crap , it's only got about four or five computers inBut it would do quite good for our job , 'cause ithas not very uh p notmany people in it very often .
A	Yeah , print
A	Okay .
B	Yeah .
A	Right . Is there a printer in there too ?
D	Yeah , there's fridge there . And there's a photo-copier with the code on it , yeah yeah .It's cool , yeah .
C	Really ?
A	A niceokay . That would come in handy , yeah .
C	Really ?
C	Ah . Well , I'm just
B	Oh , is that the photo-copier I heard I heard about ? Yeah .
A	Hey , we could we could photo-copy our um assignmentif we wanted to .Yeah . Well the comments I'm thinking .
D	none
C	I've got it in my computer . Whatever is in my computer .
B	Yeah .
B	Yeah .
B	So what time do we say ?
A	Um
C	I just think it's better to do it afterwards . Then we have all the time we need . Rather than have half an hour and then we'll surely run out .
A	Yeah , that's true . So after D_N_L_G_ . Yeah .
D	Oh right .
B	Yeah , yeah .
D	Yeah , yeah .
B	Yeah , yeah , yeah . Okay . Hmm .
A	As long as D_N_L_G_ doesn't go late .
C	Oh .
D	Hopefully it's not that man , so it won't matter .
C	Actually it's not even confirmed yet . What waShe doesn't even know what she's talking about yet , I think .Maybe it doesn't happen at all .
B	What ?
A	Oh .
B	It's true .
A	So
B	Yeah , I don't know . It's reading week next . It should beit shouldn't be anywell , it's supposed to benext week . It's week six next week .
A	Sounds like me
C	Is it really ?
A	Are you ? Next week ? Or the week? How?
C	Really ?
A	Oh .
C	I don't think we have a reading week though . The the
B	I don't know . We have one class at least when welike speech perception , we don't have any lectures . But I think we're having like all other classes . Souh there's notpoint in having
A	Yeah . That's cancelled ?
A	Oh really ?
C	Yeah , I don't think there is an officialI don't think there was an official one last semester . I think it was just a bank holiday , wasn't it ?
A	Hmm .
A	Um something like that . I think one orcouple classes were cancelled .
B	No , I think it w
D	Some classes did and some classes didn't .It's all a bit bizarre really . They didn't really know what was going on .
A	Yeah . ExactYeah . I th
B	Yeah ,which are a bit crap , yeah . I think the under-graduates haduh all were off totally .
C	No 
A	Yeah .
A	I think it was up to the professor whetherthey did it or not . Well , I don't feel like teaching . Yeah , okay . I thinkyeah . I think D_I_L_ will probably have one to make up for missing classes . D_I_L_ will probably have classes , yeah .
D	Nah , make 'em work .
B	What ?
B	Yeah , th we will probably have it , yeah yeah .last week . Yeah .
C	Okay . Let's meet Monday .
A	Yep .
D	Done .
B	Yeah , um I guess that's it . Was there anything else ? Do anyone knowyou wanna like take care of this or should I take care of it ?
C	Hmm ?
D	Oh , we trust you .
A	You can have it . Yeah .
B	Yeah .I don't know if there was something . Oh I think he basically said
B	um the same things as in the comments , if I could read it .
B	Can you read that ?
A	Huh ? Which one , the top one ?Um
A	Do you really want multiple windows from a single lap ?
B	Yeah .
B	From a single application
A	But most will probably want to go with defaults .
B	Yeah . Well , uh that was, I guess .
A	Yeah . Yeah . You'd be s
D	Yeah , I think the comments are basically the same as what you said . So it's
A	Yeah , exactly , and just the other comment about whether you wanna do both speaker characterisation and topic segmentation .
B	Oh .
B	No .
A	Yeah , yeah that's about it . Nothing terribly exciting .
B	Oh yeah . Yeah ? And now we have seven percent ofthe course already done ?Is quite good .So if y
A	Okay .
A	Yeah .Alright .Okay . So
D	Yeah .
C	Right . I think we need to tick the okay box , right ?
B	If you'reokay with uh havinOh .
C	Ooh .Exciting .
D	Oof . Bu buzzes . Yeah .
A	Okay . Yeah .
D	Signing off , innit ?Log off .
B	Who ? Yeah .
A	Okay .
C	Should we turn these off then or what ?
B	We're done now .I uh
B	Is she still here ? Yes , you are . Yeah .
