B	Okay .
C	Okay .
D	So b maybe I'll go back to your questions . Um
C	Yes .
B	Mm-hmm .
C	So you were talking about the two first question ? Okay . And a little bit about same people moving , with the clustering .
D	Yeah .
D	Um
D	Yeah .
D	And this also um allows you to separate people .
C	Uh-huh .
D	Um and the questions I did not talk about was uh going from location to uh identity of the person . Um
D	That is quite different , you you need to use a signal you have separated and uh do the type of analysis I mentioned . Um from the spectrumyou can transform the the magnitude spectrum and um um build model of the person .
A	Mm-hmm .
D	Um
B	Or actually look at the pitch , no ? Don'task me how it's doneII know the theory , so , yeah .
C	So this one .
D	Yeah , pitch at least . But pitch is
D	Pitch isn'tis not enough sometimes .
A	Actually uh you can t perhaps just uh just
B	Isn't it the pitch and the frequency ? The base frequency of th
D	I it's a frequency , yeah , yeah . It's a frequency of your vibration here . Uh
A	Th there is one frequency that is the base fromfor uh
D	Yeah . And then it's transformed through the mouth , that's the usual model .
B	And if you have both you can umwell , you can compare this toto one stored and so get out uh which person it is . Pardon ?
A	Okay .
A	Both . Mm the pitch and uh and the freque
C	What ?
B	And uhwell , the things that make the sou the voice .
A	Okay , s and you can measure measure that ? Or
D	Yeah .
D	Iyeah , um it's not necessarily done explicitly , but it's equivalent to that , yeah . So again , F_F_T_ is useful to do this type of analysis . Um
B	Yeah .
C	I'm sorry , I didn't really get the point of comparing the pitchthe pitch is the is the frequency that isokay . And the way you transform it uh v by the mouth ? You were comparing what with what ?
D	Yeah , but it's quite personal . Uh
D	Yeah .
B	And and the the holes in your head , everything , the the nose and so on , and that's that's really uh unique for ev well almost unique for every person , so .
C	Uh-huh , okay , okay .
D	Yeah .
C	So uh
C	And you were talking about comparing what with what ?
B	Well once you get this information , your frequency and uh your vocal contract or how it's called , uh yyou can use this information to compare to to to the frames here .
D	Yeah , yeah .
C	Okay .
C	But you want to have the information because the the mouth , you move it .
D	It it's an information equivalent to that . It'smaybe n you don't need to do the whole uh complicated modelling , but
B	No , but
C	To scan t all the user
B	No no no no . That that thateverything is done through through the voice here , you take a voice of someone , and then you can get out this information , it's it's not p it's clear it's not perfect , but s it's enough to to to use it for for different purposes and uh
D	No , no .
C	Okay .
C	Okay , so you have the p the pitch and you have information about the voice dynamic or
D	Yeah , rate of speech is also possibility . Umhow fast you speak , that's quite personal also . But it varies over time , um depending on emotion . That also might be interesting for you , detecting emotion .
A	Okay .
C	Mm mm mm .
C	Emotion , the involvement in a discussion . If you are saying oh yeah yeahwe should
D	Yeah , yeah .
D	And us yeah , yeah , so these measures are a way to quantify that .
C	Okay .
A	And iis it uh expensive to do 
C	In C_P_U_ you mean ?
B	Um not not that , well uh as far as I know .Actual
D	Uh p no . No , no it's not .
A	But in fact if y you speak of uh a lot of things that are not expensive , at the end you have uh something that is .
D	What w wwhat is m what is more expensive is to um take the decision finally . So your decision can be for example uh who is it , or if the person moved ,which is probably the most complicated thing , like the person goes away , then comes back ten minutes later , sits at a different place . Uh you will need to build statistical models of umthe person identity using these measures . So the ones um he mentioned um
D	I don't know if you're familiar with that .
B	Is it called P_C_M_ ? I thi um well it's it's not a technology s yeah . It's more or less used this to compress audio . I have toI want to check it , I can show it you afterwards .
D	Yeah .
D	Yeah .
D	So um
C	Not really familiar .
B	well I did a course about it , but uI shouldn't say it too loud , because um the professor is working here at IDIAP .I should reread what I signed there so .
D	No .
C	Hmm .Okay , so you are the expert .
A	Hmm .
D	Yeah .
C	Careful , you are recorded .
C	Okay .
D	S 
C	Okay , so all this stuff is done from the F_F_T_ .
D	Yeah .
A	So you have to do F_F_T_ , because otherwise
C	Also location to identity .U
D	All I was saying is that these different measures are a way to uh evaluate the identity of the person . So iwith location all you can do is extract segments of speech , for example , but it will not tell you that these are the same person . It's just a location .
C	Mm-hmm .
C	Okay .
A	Mm-hmm .
C	Mm-hmm .
C	But to get a cluster the location that is uh a place where uh noise is regularly coming from .
D	Yeah .
D	Yeah .
D	Yeah , so that might be good for example for ten minutes , but then the person might move , or a different person might come .
C	Mm-hmm .
C	Mm mm mm .
C	But for instance for a setting like uh here it would be enough , because we are not moving .
D	Yeah .
D	It is .Well , unless sometimes somebody goes there oryeah .
C	Okay , right . But we are uh targeting a place where we don't know i where it will be more flexible , so we need more than just uh location if we want to uh
A	Yes.
D	Yeah .
A	Yes , but it
B	Well uh iI'm even not sure if it's that important to know which person is talking , because uh if uh if itI think about a table , or so something uh physical , uh you just want to know in in which corner of the table uh speech is coming and not uh which person produced the speech , so .
D	Mm-hmm .
C	Mm-mm .
D	Yeah .
C	I agree . Maybe just
A	I it it is im
D	Yeah .
A	It i ityes , it is important for detecting patterns . Because uh if you say uhlet's sayuh w how much the person um have spoken over the the five last minutes , uh
D	Yeah .
B	Yeah , but it's not really related to theah , yeah , I see it's uhyou need a bit both uh
D	So ithmm .
A	Uh if someone come andyes .
D	But that you can do with location , if it's only on the short term .
A	Yes , yes . Y
C	I think it may it may be okay , but it depends how long
D	On on the off-lineyeah . I would say you might use these measures in a simple way if you do it uh on-line . Like um to give feedback . But uh you you mentioned that another side of your project is also to analyse off-line . So there you might want to use a
C	Hmm .
A	This is uhmm.
D	We had a student here , he finished uh one or two years ago , but he left his software , and his software is precisely to do that to um clusterat uh another level , to cluster these small clusters of speech , uh group them by person automatically . Yno , from thethese measures , pitch , etcetera .
C	From th from the location .
C	Oh .
A	Okay . So i uh this is only based on uhyou give uh the spectrum and uhuh okay .
D	So um
B	Sound .
D	Yeah , exactly . So I would say from location at the lower level you can get small parts of speech , and then at the next level , possibly off-line , you can uh group them into um aspeech segment .I'm hoping to have enough time to try um doing thatbefore I finish my thesis .Um so if I manage to do some umuh practically usable software , I'll tell you .
A	Mm-hmm .
A	Yes .
C	Mm-hmm . When are you planning to finish your
D	Uh in five , six months , abou approximately .
C	Okay .
A	But uh the last ones are always the
C	More extensible .
A	Mm not really .
D	More busy I would say .
C	Mm .
A	Mm yes .
D	Yeah .
D	So you said you want to do separation , um butex exactly , yeah .
C	I don't know how mu maybe we would be more interested to know that it's not the same people , more than knowing that it's the same people . Or to detect that someone is morethat was not talking before is talking now .
D	Yeah .
D	Okay .
D	Okay .
A	Hmm uh II said uh we want tto know to umto do separation just because of the voice recognition . I mm this is not thyes .Yes , no , butbut in fact we have uhyes , we are designing uh a noise sensitive table just f from your ring , but we are also designing uh a prototype um to analyse the conversations . So uh we might add there a lot of uh features .
D	Ah , you want to do voice recognition .
D	You might want . Okay .
B	You might might want to do.
C	Yes .
D	Okay .
D	Yeah .
D	Soyeah , once you have locations it's not a big problem . Um
A	Okay . And uh I don't know , perhaps uh perhaps if you have two people speaking uh speaking uhat the same time , uh I don't know if uh voice recognition of an uhsuch a stream is uhreal. Okay .
D	Mm-hmm .
D	No no , you should separate them first , yeah , yeah .
D	So
A	Yes , so that's fine.
D	So the type of things I presented can lead to separation .
A	Mm-hmm .
A	Sure .
D	Um it's only a very small step to add .
A	Yes , it's not um every important feature for now , but
D	Yeah , yeah .
D	Although it might be , if you want to um ex extract these features like pitch and uh rate of speech , or energy simply , from each person . Um you might have to do some ba basic separation . 'Cause quite often people uh don't realise that they talk at the same time , um interrupt each other . So even if you don't want to recognise a speech fully , at least um you needyeah .
C	Mm .
A	Mm-hmm .
C	Mm .
A	Yes .
B	You need to separate it .
A	And uhuh anothewhat uh. Um I don't remember .
D	It's okay .You can email later . Yeah . Um
D	So
C	Okay .
A	Yes , also uh to to extract the context .
D	Yeah .
A	Mm because if you know the words that are spoken , you calet's say uh someone say uh he's angry uhabout the word he'sseen . Yes .
D	Uh
D	Okay . A semantic context , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , thenmm .
A	You mi you might want to add uh this kind ofthis is not in uh my project , bu
C	That are further directions .
B	No , but I think once you have the voice for a person , you can start to do this and uh once uh people have speech recognition oruh far enough to t
A	Yes .Um
D	Hmm .
C	Professorwas interested to know when people were talking about him Ah , someone is talking about me , let's listen .
B	Mm uh .
D	So it's uh
D	Yeah , you could detect one word , yeah . Keyword spotting ,yeah .
A	Yes .
A	And have a special events trigger if
C	And lighting aon his office .
D	So um
C	Okay , so are you done w with what you wanted to presented us uh in regards with these questions ?
D	Yeah .Yeah , I I'll just say uh if you want I can point to um three papers , um but no , I think it's better if I just send you the link , it's probably simpler .
B	I think so .
A	Sure .
B	The link . Mm .
A	Sure .
C	Mm mm .three papers about ?
D	Uh one im is about this um sector based stuff , like uh the localisation and detection .
C	Mm-hmm .
C	Okay .
D	One is about how to take the decision , that somebody's active or not . Um it sounds simple at first , you think you just put the threshold and that's it , but um the problem is uh the
C	It's n no problem . No more time for problems .Okay .
A	No , it'sit doesn't sound simple , buyes , you canyes .
D	Itno , you can do that .There's no problem , but i if you want your your system to work in different conditions , like cafeteria , library , um the environment will be quite different , so a single fixed threshold value might be a problem . S
C	Uh uh .
A	Sure .
A	Yes , in fact uh for now we are using uh a kind of calibration , but uh it's still um
D	Yeah .
D	So you can do that automatically , this kind of things . Um I don't know if you're doing that already , but uh
A	Yes .
B	Okay .
A	Yes , um uh but in fact you have to sit in front of the microphone , and it's uhyeah , people one speak and people two and people three and you are just uh subtracting the the level that you you kept in the other microphones .
D	Okay .
D	So uh I have another paper which might be interesting for thatfor a single channel uh calibration . And I've code on-line , sofor this particular one .
A	Okay .
A	Okay .
D	And the last one I would say is um the clustering um to uyeah , the clustering of the different locations over time , so that you can get small clusters of speech . Um there are other ways to do it , but uh I thinkit's it's important because um in spontaneous speech all these words are quite small . So you need to do that uh adequately ,yeah . But otherwise yeah , I'm done .
A	Mm-hmm .
A	Mm-hmm .
C	Mm mm mm .
A	Okay , just uh a last question , um when you mentioned it . Umif I'm speaking very uh , how do you say it , uyes , I'm just speaking one word every uh every one second . Yes a . Uhis ththe event that is detected is umwill beuh a sum of uh small parts ? There won't be uhokay . So youyes , you have to to reprocess to uh to say let's say yes . There is a very small um interval . You have to consider it uh .
D	Hmm .
C	Slowly .
D	Yeah , yeah . Many small events basically , yeah .
D	Yeah , basically uhI mean it depends uh
A	Because this isyes , this is onthis can be considered as one interv intervention .
D	Yeah , even if somebody says just yes .
D	I don't know if it's important for you or not .It might be .
A	It might be .
C	Might .
A	This is nota very uh easy problem .
C	For the first application we will do with uh prototypes , it will be more about quantity uh of speech or how long , how much someone speak , but when we will go to final uh details , if I'm talking and someone say yes yes yes from time to time , it show that he's participating , and obviously it makes different that if someone is talking and one is replying never uh nor moving or nor having eyes open
D	Yeah .
D	Yeah .
D	Hmm .
D	Yeah .
D	YYeah .
D	Yes . Um
D	So I I'll send you linkssome of the papers are long , but you can just um briefly look , yeah .
C	Okay .
C	Go through them .
C	Okay .
D	Um we can go and see Olivier , unless you want to talk about something else .
C	No , I think uh I think we hasalready have plenty to read .
B	No , I think does this work , email ?
A	I'm done .
D	Huh ?
B	Does it work if I put in my email and uh
D	Well , we can try . But uh
C	Try .
B	No , if it's not uhI guess you would have to install it and so on .
D	We haveyeah , we have O_C_R_ , butmaybe not on this computer .Yeah .
B	Uh no no no , you see uh I thought you can put in here your email address and and just uh do this and then it mails me .Yeah , you see I want too much .
D	That is good idea , yeah . It's a good idea .
C	And the application you are using , all of them uh y every time you are using Matlab , or you are programmingeverything is based based on Matlab ?
D	Yeah , yeah .
D	Yeah . Once II um codedthe most expensive part in C_ just to seso you can have a mix of both . From Matlab you call C_ andback .
C	Mm .
A	Sure , yes . And you can code Java .
B	And after all Matlab is also programming ,so it
D	But the day you want to do uh on-line real time stuffnah , I wouldn't wouldn't trust it .
A	You can choose Matlab .
C	Mm mm mm .
B	Mm-hmm .
A	Yes , sure . You have to code it uh directly to the machine .
C	Okay .
B	So .
B	Thank you for the information .
A	Hmm .
A	My sheet is very uh filled up .
A	I will take yours .
C	I'm writing so only me can read .
C	It's uh a kind of secret language .
C	Okay .
