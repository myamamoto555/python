C	My name is Xavier Juergens , I'm the Industrial Designer , and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today . First one is uh what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is uh the apparatus made of , and the third is what should it look like .
D	Hmm .
A	What should it look like ? Okay .
D	Hmm .
A	Oh , let's kick it off . Oh , there we go . So , our new project is aboutwe need design a remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I took this off our corporate website . It'sI think well it sums up what we need to do .
A	We're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . That's why our product will always fit in your home . So apparently we need toum be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want . So
D	Yeah .
D	Yeah .
A	So we put the fashion in electronics . So that's what we need to go for . Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . First step will be the functional design . And that's basically what we're gonna do . Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information aboutSo I'm gonna keep this short , since we had a technical problem . So skip through this .
D	Yeah .
A	Uh . Okay . Every meeting weeverybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you havewe have the SMARTboards here . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it'sactually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen .
A	Like you see here , I'll just take thetakehere . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want .
A	It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want .
A	And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you justeither take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger .
A	So it should be really easy . This is to take thejust take a new slide and back again . We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will beit's very clear for everyone , I suppose . So I'll take this out .
D	Okay .
A	Okay . We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever .
A	So next , been here .Well ,gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . So basic idea is
A	we have a blank sheet . Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal .
A	I think the creative genius should go first .
B	The creative genius ? Thank you very much .
A	So , draw us your favourite animal .
B	Well , I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing , so I'm not really good at drawing animals , but uh the animal which Oh .
A	Draw us a technical animal .
A	Yeah , it's still erasing .
B	Pen .
B	Uh format .
B	Else my animal will be like king-size . I pretty much likea dolphin , because of its uh its freedom basically . Let's see .
B	A head .
B	actually worked with this . It's like uh it's a very
B	Uh high-tech . Bit low-responsive though . Prefer pen and paper .
A	So that's what we don't want . We want a high-responsive product . So
A	It looks more like nuclear bomb .
D	Very nice dolphin .
B	Idoesn't look like a nuclear bomb . This thing isn't doing what I'm
B	What I want .
B	So
A	Let's go easy on it .
B	Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb .
B	I'll just finish up real soon , because I'm
B	So it doesn't really look like a dolphin , but then again , this is all new for me .
A	Anyway , it shouldItIt's supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that itthat it represents .
C	Uh-huh .
B	Like the ocean , like swimming . Do that in my spare time , so that's basically an
A	What do you like ? Okay . Well , our Marketing Expert . Show us an animal .
B	Now we can forget this ever happened .
D	Um an animal . I like the elephant .
A	Pick apick apick a clean sheet . Oh . Take a clean sheet first .

D	Yeah . Um
A	Just press next . That's it .
D	Oh yeah . Oh , a blank . Okay , next . Free , I like the elephant . It's big , it's strong , so uh uhOh , it's a little bit
B	It's not really that responsive , no .
D	You have to hold it , right ?
C	Mm .
D	Hmm .
D	It's a beautiful animal .
D	Oh , you have to p press it pretty hard .
D	With a smile on it , it's very important .
A	It's a cute elephant .
D	Yeah .
D	And uh not to forget its tail .
D	Oh .
A	It's a nice beard .
D	Yeah , it's okay .
B	And you was making comments on my dolphin .
D	Yes .
D	I will beat the dolphin .No .
A	Okay , so it's just a bee .
D	Yeah .

D	Yeah .
D	Yeah .
C	Okay .
D	Uh yeah .
C	Okay , you should press next .
D	Yeah .
A	Press next . Yeah , it's up there .
C	Okay .
A	That's it .
C	Okay , well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger .
B	You picked a hard one , didn't you ?
D	Experience with the tiger .
C	My drawing skills are really bad , so .
D	What ? They are
C	They are really bad , my drawing skills .
D	Okay uh-huh .
A	Sure looks smooth .
D	Oh .
C	I'm not sure how the legs should go , but
C	Uh these are stripes .
B	Got it .
C	I've picked this animal because it's very fast . It is uh it knows exactly what it wants . Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources .
A	What does it want ?
C	Uh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . Uh it knows exactly what it wants . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything , security , speed and efficiency is important . And I think uh those things we can use .
A	Okay .
D	Mm .
A	I agree .
D	Okay .
A	Yay , I'm supposed to draw the animal next .
A	I introduce to the world the amazing
A	ant .
D	Uh hard worker .
A	Great team-workers .
D	Yeah .
C	Yeah .
A	Do everything to Uh really small , but together they're really strong . So I'm gonna give it a smiley face .
D	Yeah , yeah .
C	Oh .
A	Not sure where the p. Just put 'em here . Whatever .
A	Think it need shoes . So
A	I'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so
A	That's the coolest ant ever .
B	You've done this before , haven't you ?
A	I love to draw ants . It's my hobby . AnywayNah .JustI think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . Like you takejust take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us .
D	Yeah .
A	JustYeah . You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . Anyway .another beep to stop the meeting . See . Warning . Finish meeting now .
A	Uh put this down .
A	Examples . Well I guess we have a little little time extra , butJust a little quick discussion to to open open our work . So what do you guys think aboutThe first idea is just very short . I'll start with you . What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? What
B	Well , I basically had a question . DouhAre we going to introduce a multi remote control ? Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in
D	U
A	The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control .
B	Just for T_V_ remote control . Okay . Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all . Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . No rational changes or whatever , 'cause itrevolutionary changes , yes .
D	Yeah .
A	Yeah , I guess so .
D	But
D	Yeah .
A	Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess .
B	Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add , and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ?
A	Yeah , we want
A	I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . SoI thinkI mean , really disabled people , yeah ,might be a problem , but I think it's a littletake it into consideration . Um yeah . I think we really need to cut the meeting short . You have anything you wanna share quickly ?
C	Hmm . Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . That'sit speaks for itself , but some uhYeah .
